 what are you doing   i've got slow drying pubic hair   maybe it's time for a trim   they're not long  they're just spongy   what  out of interest  was in the     it's not a human head   it's not a human head   no  it's the weight and shape of a human head   but it isn't a human head   well  that's good  it's just that  now you've said  human head  a lot   i'm thinking  is it a human head   and the answer is  no   so you can relax cos it's definitely not a human head   hey  kingsley  i'm just cooking my speciality dish     vegetable munge   sounds    disappointing   no offence  but i won't be eating that shit because it looks heinous   so  this is very generous of you   what a very generous person you are   do you want me to lay the table   or do you want to do all the laying   what looks like a head  but isn't a head   you know what  maybe let's not bother sitting down together   yeah  wouldn't be so much fun without jp   he is amazing company   a knobbly melon   maybe everyone just help themselves   which is your motto  right   i'm kidding   what   i've seen enough rom coms to know   if you  hate  her  you must  like  her   what are you doing   that's paul's room  have you asked him   er  yeah  he was totally chilled about it  you know what he's like   no  not really  i haven't actually met him  have you met him   he's not here  it's a temporary arrangement   we'll all use each other's rooms as work out spaces anyway  it's all fine   did you tell kingsley about the other night   no   it's obvious you did   so what if i did  why are you so desperate to keep it a secret   i mean  what's so wrong with me   nothing   yeah  i mean  i'll grant you  it was an unusual coalition   but what you've got to understand  babes   is this is the kind of thing that will happen under the coalition   they close down the nhs  we get jiggy  deal with it   i mean  it won't happen again   unless you want it to   in which case  my door's always open   unless i've got another girl in there in which case it's definitely closed   i tell you what i could do  i could tie a tie to the door handle  and then  if you see the tie  lucky you vis a vis jiggy time   right  um  do me a favour   tell kingsley you were bullshitting him  it never actually happened   no   why not   look  i'm not being chivalrous here     although obviously  i am     but i'm not ashamed of doing you   that's really sweet   i know   although  obviously it isn't   and the thing is  i am a shamed of doing you   oh   yeah  well  we can't go to any of the hall parties   but the house is nice  so     yeah  they're nice   well  the girls are nice   the boys are cocks   two of them are megacocks   no  it's great  i'm just a little bit homesick  you know   oh  ok   yeah  yeah  of course   no  i was just ringing to say hello   ok   how nice of you to pay me a visit  pope kingsley   what   kingsley the judgmental pope man   doing his judging  have you come to judge me some more   i wasn't  i     look  i know you know i slept with jp  but i want to say for the record  that i didn't know him at all at the time  i'd hardly spoken to him   i had no way of knowing what a dick he is   i don't make a habit of sleeping with men i've hardly spoken to  but if i do it now and again   it doesn't make me a bad person  so you can fuck off  popey   what   classic   absolutely classic   you'll be humpin'

year off  having had a penis i didn't know about   good   yes   certainly one of the more memorable hallway conversations   what are you doing   yes  i shouldn't have looked   i have only myself to blame   what is it   obviously  it's russell brand's head   have you killed russell brand   no   really   my mate worked at a waxworks place  they screwed him on overtime  so i looked after the head while he blackmailed them   i see   yes   but they've just put a ruffly shirt on cher  squidged her around   and put his label on her so you can have that if you like   i don't know  i don't know if i want  the weight of russell brand's head on my shoulders   you don't have to fucking feed him   greetings  my waxy friend   i shall use you as an enormous emo paperweight   ok  laters  guys  laters

a bmw x1   i can't drive it at the moment  got points on my license   apparently i was speeding and apparently i was drunk   students who have cars are dicks   yeah   why   because they're not students   if you've got a car and a satnav   you're a ponce whose dad works in the city  and sells nerve gas to fuckheads   cars are cool  everyone knows it   that's why even lesbians like top gear

he shows it to the provost   have we got a provost   i'm not sure what a provost is   but that sounds like something they'd hate   look i'm sure it's fine   he's probably a virgin  doesn't know what the text means   is that him  that's him isn't it  what does it say    i'll be there  i'm greasing up my penis as i write    good luck with your party   bet you're looking forward to seeing our tutor

and i don't like it   no  they're not for you   the premium continental lagers are clearly labelled   and the same goes for the goujons   they're for ralph and toby  if you want food  eat josie's munge   say that again   the pan of pressure cooked carrots  onions and potato   it's actually got quite a subtle flavour   right   for a minute there i was thinking i might have to re grease my penis   excellent  team ralph's here  i need to get them a vip area   otherwise they'll be mobbed by all these no marks and zeros   no offence to you  kingsley   hey  'sup  dude  good to see ya   t dog in

wouldn't do that   there's going to be loads of babes here  any minute   go get the door   in the meantime  let's get busy on the tour   all aboard the banter bus   coolio   so  this is my room   the bachelor pad   the flop shop   yeah  i chose the top floor room  so that even if i'm taking a bird from behind  i've got a good view   yeah   and if we just come through here     that's the ensuite  and this is the smoking room   so  whose room is this   basically just my spare room  you know  a little bolt hole   somewhere to come and chillax when it gets too hectic   let me clear some of this shit away   rowing machine  you any good   mate   that's not the rowing machine   this is the rowing machine   we're thinking of getting a crew together   well  let me show you how many rows i can do

row and keep a conversation going at the same time   so what do you reckon   show us how many rows you can do while smoking a spliff   easy   what do you think   keep it going  keep it going   looking good  hey   yeah  man  you look the tits   hey  terrible party   i've got an idea   but i don't know if it's a good idea   russell brand's head    as fuckbait   doesn't sound great   no  that sounds bad   too weird  on the pillow   that's mad  or is it   but then i could curl up hidden under the covers   then when someone came in    i'm not going to do this   i'm not going to use russell brand's head as fuckbait   what rom com did you see this in   was it there's something about fuckbait   or when harry used fuckbait   the idea of going to a gym in manchester  does not bear thinking about   i do not want some sweaty shaun ryder   arching his back on a pilates ball   thrusting his coke addled testes in my mush   no   fuck that   that's why we've got our own gym stuff   we're just looking for somewhere to set it up   well  i mean     you can use here if you want   it's just my den   yeah   yeah  fuck it  i'm not using anything for it   all right  tobes  why don't you drive back  and bring the weights over   yeah   cool   why weight   you don't mind if i      no  course not   yeah  i mean  it's only a fucking beer  right   yeah  that's right   were you afraid i was nicking your petit filou   no  i wouldn't mind that  i mean  they're only little   is that    are you having a pop   no   i'm dave  by the way   hello  kingsley   how's the house  anyone got laid yet   well  not

munge  yeah i'd never heard of it  it's a real thing  then  is it   nah  just what josie calls it   so are you on her course   no  i'm her boyfriend   oh   right  yeah   yeah  yeah  i was wondering who her boyfriend was  i assumed she had a boyfriend  you're her boyfriend  brilliant   god  i am hammered   you're not the drummer  are you   you asked me that already  i told you   i'm the front man   excellent  i love a front man   the drummer's here somewhere   fuck him  drummers are boring  always hiding away behind their drums   hiding away behind their sticks   mainly the drums  you can't really hide behind sticks   will you let me finish the story about playing the borderline   yes  i am   ok  then   in a minute   hey   so  how's it going   he's hot but he's boring   so  do you think we could head back   no  i'm going to snog him just to shut him up   so  are you a student   no   nooo   so  what do you do   i'm a heating engineer   cool  very cool   you don't know anything about it  do you   no   no   yeah    so  how long have you been seeing josie   why  are you sniffing around   what   i'm kidding  i know you're not like that  you're a petit filous man   what does that mean   we've been going out two and a half years   really   why is that so surprising   just    seems like a long time   surely she must have told you all this   um  no  not all of it   you want another beer   er  yeah  why not  fuck it   yeah  i mean  it's not like you have to be up tomorrow  is it   or ever   you piece of shit   i'm kidding   way to say hello  i like it   ha  yeah  i'm just friendly like that   you must be vod  riz was saying he thought you had a thing for him   yeah  he's well arrogant   yeah  he's a twat  unlike me  i'm lovely  i'm mark  the drummer   yeah  i know that  i can tell you apart   yeah  it's not hard  i'm the one with the sticks   exactly  that's exactly what i meant   wait there  i'll be right back   glad i remembered how to drive   i can't remember the last time i had to drive   presumably you had to drive to uni  so     yeah  but apart from that one drive  i've basically never driven   yeah  so do you think we should head back   yeah  maybe  i'll go see what vod's doing   we've got to go  i've snogged the wrong guy   what   it must be because they were wearing the same jacket   i'm not racist for asians  i'm not racist  i'm just slutty   there you are  yeah  vod wants to head off too  so     ok  great  all back to ours   so     so    there is a rumour that russell brand is in your room  and passed out on downers   yeah  yeah  he is  i could introduce you if you like   the head worked   not as in fuck bait   but chat bait  it's a good head   i'm growing quite attached to the head   josie's got a boyfriend   she's not mentioned a boyfriend   yes  i'd noticed that   so how do you  feel  about that   fine  i was a bit angry   i was pretty angry   but it's none of my business   she doesn't owe me anything  so let's move on   i mean  she shouldn't have lied to me   that was a total betrayal   but i barely know her  so it's basically fine   fucked up   but fine   i'm ready to move on  i've already moved on  it's fine   nothing to move on from  it's all fine  i'm actually glad   ok  good   yeah  apparently russell brand's upstairs  probably washing some  female ejaculate out of his pubey woobs  as he'd put it   shocking guy   so  how's the party been without me  bit shit  or total shit   hey  babe   dave  what are you doing here   i thought i'd surprise you   you did  i am surprised   really surprised  i am so fucking surprised   so  kingsley here has been looking after me while you were gone   he seems nice   does he  good  he is nice   as are you   the hotties are back   all of my bitches have rolled on home   all three of them   is that the best you can do  it's hardly an embarrassment of bitches   i'll get it  i'll get it   so  how come you just turned up   i thought it'd be a nice surprise for you   it is  a huge surprise   i see josie's pulled   he's her boyfriend   josie hasn't got a boyfriend   that's not what his body language says  or his mouth language   well  it makes sense  i mean  she is a bit girl next door   perfect wife material   yeah  she's just ridiculously lovely  isn't she   so  um  by the way  i've got a car   my mum gave it to me   she won it on a scratch card   which is mad  but then she buys fuck loads   so  um  yeah  i think she might be addicted   pretend you're my boyfriend   what  why   i was drunk  it was dark   i'm not racist  i just put my hand down the wrong trousers  gromit   there you are   i've got a boyfriend   you've got a boyfriend   hello  that's right  i'm howard   howard the boyfriend   you're really her boyfriend   yeah   i don't believe you   fuck off  riz   i'm mark   fuck off  mark   yeah  fuck off  mark   he's my boyfriend  right  get over it   i'm sorry  he's not your boyfriend   if he wasn't  would i do this   possibly not   right  careful with the munge   the munge now has sick in it   all the warm bit is sick   the cooler bit is still good munge   check it out  the wentworth crowd   looks like we've got a happening party going on   yay   this could be fun  i think dave might be about to kick the shit out of ralph   you should stop them   yeah  i should stop them  but    do i want to stop them   he might also kick the shit out of jp  who doesn't want that   so  i have a question for you guys   jp here reckons he's a bit of a fanny magnet   hey  cut that shit out   there's no  reckons  about it   i am the fuckmeister general   if he is your boyfriend  why were you all over me before   we have an open relationship   no  we fucking haven't  i'm fucking serious about you  howard   and you're serious about me   well  why were you all over him  then   it was a moment of madness  you know what i'm like   that's true  i do know what she's like  and she's mad   so  my question to you is  is it true  as jp claims   that he pulled on his first night here   yeah  he pulled   he pulled himself off looking at his own facebook photo   this is just like more of your bullshit  vod   like when you snogged russell brand  i mean  yeah  fine  russell brand   but  who's this guy   he's just some guy  he's not a celebrity   i'm a drummer   that doesn't count   have you heard that russell brand's in the house   britain's favourite dickensian goth is here  c'mon  i'll show you   so  what's he got that i haven't got   isn't it obvious   no   well     he's comfortable in his own skin  unlike you   you want to be mark   i am mark   you want to be riz   you know what i mean   i don't want to be like riz  actually  riz is a fucking twat   and so are you   look i'm sorry  riz   mark  i'm sorry  mark   she asked me to be her temporary boyfriend   it's a service i provide   they had this pyro man  his name was philippe   they called him the human torch  there was supposed to be  this backdrop  he pumped me in with his guitar in borderline   the other cool thing about the girls in the house  is you can sort of    talk to them and shit   you know   how do you mean   i don't know  it's like   it's like they're sort of just     ok   i can't really explain   that is fucking poor gym etiquette   jp  those weights are expensive   go and save my dumbbells  dumbbell   paul   paul  paul  mate  would you stop throwing shit out the window   paul  please don't be a cunt  paul   paul  let me in  open the fucking door   you will cease and desist   paul   so first you nick my trainers  then you nick riz   i thought you wanted to get off with mark   why would you think that   because you were getting off with mark   doesn't matter    they're all the same  anyway   men  not asians   so  where were we   yeah  i     ralph's chipped  gougon's cained   and josie's got a boyfriend   so that's my fall back shag out the window   for tonight  anyway   right  that's it  i've had enough  i'm going to bed   what are you doing   i'm letting this serve as a warning   who to   in general   a general warning   look  i'm sorry about getting off with riz  yeah   i only did it to shut him up   amazing party   classic party   man  my car  that's     cool  cos it's my dad's  the dick   pass the ash tray   'pregnancies among teenagers are often unplanned and unwanted   'unlike older mothers   'teenager mothers lack
