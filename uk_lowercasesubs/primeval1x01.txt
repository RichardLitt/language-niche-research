hey  let me in   professor cutter   professor     professor cutter      connor temple   i'm sorry  i've never heard of it  i think you want archeology   if you go around up there to the right and keep walking it's on your left   no  it's not a place  it's my name  i'm one of your students   really   well  why    why don't i recognize you   well  you've never actually turned up for the seminars   professor   don't touch anything   this is my laboratory technician  stephen hart     hi    hi   oh  actually  that's my dissertation   yeah   you see i argued that all life on earth derived     from organisms carried here by alien spacecrafts   it's pretty sexy stuff   it's a work in progress  really   tell me what this is   a fish   obviously   it's a sarcopterygian   there's no trace of them in the fossil record for 70 million years   and then suddenly one of them just pops up in the middle of the indian ocean   totally inexplicable in modern evolutionary terms   see  darwin provides most of the answers   it's the pieces that don't fit that interest me   see  that's why i was wondering if you might have seen this   some sort of giant  undiscovered predator   oh no  no  no  no  no  this  this is the real thing   connor  you should get out more  go to a bar  meet a nice girl     life will seem a lot less confusing    i've already got a girlfriend  sort of   that's not really the point  there's an eyewitness  claimed to have seen it   people claim to have seen the loch ness monster  that doesn't mean it's there   not now  obviously  because it died years ago   the government  they took the body away and covered the whole thing up   this is just a hoax  forget it   your wife wouldn't have ignored it   my wife was a serious scientist   i just thought you might want to check it out  that's all   it's not as though the forest of dean is far away though   the forest of dean   if we leave now we could be there by lunch   come on guys  what are you waiting for   soft lighting and a frank sinatra record   how are brad and angelina   oh  totally gay  but otherwise fine   they should be mating by now   maybe they just don't fancy each other   abby    a word   abby  i'm sorry   the sponsor's pulled out and i     i have to slim down the reptile programme   and my job comes under the heading 'instant weight loss'  right   there's an attachment going at the bughouse   i could put in a word for you   i'm a lizard girl  tim  you know that   hello  tim parker   uh  well  i'll call you back  okay   ok  bye   letters  from people wanting the zoo to collect their animals   why do people buy exotic pets if they don't want them   is everything alright   i'll handle this one if you like  it's my field   i know the forest of dean pretty well   anyway  so about this attachment   yes  uh  a six month project     studying the life cycle of parasites in elephant dung   sounds unmissable   i'd just finished my rounds when i caught a glimpse of it on the monitor   can you imagine how much force it took to rip this thing open   look at the size of the marks   you know  if you want my opinion  i think it's   you don't  do you   well  if i found these gouges in the wild  i'd be certain     we were looking for a large predator   but we're in the forest of dean   it was huge and it was so fast  it was gone across the yard in a second   well  there's blood   stephen   come and give me a logical explanation for this   it's a hoax  obviously   just a difficult one to pull off   can i say something   is he alright   helen cutter came to this area eight years ago     to investigate a creature sighting   she disappeared in the forest  the body was never found   just a rucksack  no blood  no clues  nothing  she just vanished     we never expected a personal call    all part of the zoo service  mrs  trent   it's only a lizard   i see you like dinosaurs  ben   yeah  they're awesome   his name's rex   i found him in the forest   looked him up in a book and it said he was a flying dragon from southeast asia   draco volans  he's not a draco volans   no   in fact  i don't know what he is     i thought you were an expert    i am   if i'm right  you've discovered a completely unique species   oh  cool   i need you to show me exactly where you found him   it's too cold for him here  he must have escaped from a private zoo or something   i found him around here somewhere   this way   abby     slow down  wait for me    maybe it was a leopard   they sometimes drag their prey into trees and come back for it later   don't be silly  ben   how many leopards are there in the forest of dean   i don't care  it's weird  i'm getting out of here   ben  hold on  wait for me      no ones as pretty as yours   i must admit though  i've never seen you around here myself   and hey  why don't we have a drink afterwards   excuse me   don't panic   i just told that slime ball over there you were my boyfriend   one more sleazy chat up line and i was going to have to kill him   well  i'm very glad i was here to help     uh  i'm nick cutter    actually  i know who you are   claudia brown  home office  i saw you at the hotel   i'm hoping you can do me a favour  professor   another one   i suspect this is why we're both here   we get dozens of rogue animal sightings every year   you'd be doing me a great favour if you could just confirm this is all nonsense   i can't dismiss the evidence out of hand   surely you're not giving this whole monster story credibility  professor   i'm just trying to keep an open mind   people always say that as though it's such a good thing   well  you see  that depends on how you define 'monster'   a wild panther might look pretty terrifying on a dark night     is that what we're dealing with    my best guess  if it exists at all   the last sighting was somewhere near the forest   would you care to join the search   i suppose i owe it to the taxpayer to do more than     sit in my room and suck the mini bar dry   this database contains constantly updated information     on all non extinct vertebrates   i've been building it every spare second since i was 14     this is impressive    it's pretty cool  huh   and slightly sad   you know we're not talking about a wild cat  don't you   this is claudia brown from the home office     she'll be coming with us    i knew it  it's a cover up   what's he talking about   connor never met a conspiracy theory he didn't like   ben  slow down   ben   rex   not now rex  please come back   oh rex  for goodness sake   abby   rex  come here  stop messing around   if there really were some creature around here   wouldn't the journalists have found it by now   they wouldn't know what they were looking for   but you do   i've seen stephen track wounded animals through the rainforest     for up to 10 days at a time   not to mention wrestle an anaconda and save a whale   maybe there is something here  and maybe there isn't  frankly i doubt it   cutter   okay  now i'm getting interested   professor  the compass is going haywire   ben  what on earth is going on in there   i want this mess tidied up now   okay  rex  which way now   rex   don't move   is it real   some kind of experiment  maybe   hybrid  throwback   who are you   abby maitland  i'm a keeper at wellington zoo   it's a reptile  five or six tonnes at least   large supratemporal bosses  huge oesteoderms on it's back     it must be some kind of anapsid    a tortoise   stay in his field of vision  you're making him nervous   i was right  there was a dinosaur in that warehouse   whatever it is  it's classified until i figure out what the hell to do about it   bloody hell   there's 2 of them   where did that come from   no  i can't use the police  this is too sensitive   there are lives at stake here   listen  i don't need you to tell me how junior i am  okay   you're just going to have to trust me   now get somebody down here fast   i'll be making a complaint   she's filled his head with all sorts of stupid ideas   just look at the state of his room   it was the dinosaur   the simple truth is miss maitland got carried away   ben's pet was nothing more exotic than draco volans   it's a southeast asian flying lizard   there was a monster though  it chased us  tell them abby   i don't really know what happened ben  we just got frightened  that's all   but i saw the past  prehistoric times  i was there   you saw the past   there was desert and rocks and things   i blame the telly  excuse me   i know you feel bad about lying   but if word of this gets out  who knows what the consequences might be   you're both going to have to sign the official secrets act   whoa  when did this become an official secret   about 10 minutes after i finally persuaded my boss not to have me sectioned   you know  well  right now we have a far more urgent problem   that creature we saw may be many things   but it's certainly not a ruthless predator that drags its prey up into trees     well you can't be sure of that    he can   it's a herbivore  pure veggie   you mean there's another one out there   what did ben mean when he talked about seeing the past   these animals have to be coming from somewhere   what are you saying   i'm saying     that the answer is in that forest   and maybe ben found it   you know this is going to win me the nobel prize   you don't know what we're dealing with yet   come on  it looks like a dinosaur  it behaves like a dinosaur  it's a dinosaur   it's the missing link to the ancient past     and i discovered it    stephen   whoa  where's it going   let him go  it's scared   let's see where it thinks it's safe   where's it gone   home   my pen   that explains the compass going crazy   what could cause a magnetic field so powerful   maybe it's an alien spaceship   how are you feeling   confused  frightened  exhilarated   snap   you don't think they'll hurt him   of course not   everything we've seen about the animals so far is consistent with     vertebrates that last appeared in the fossil record     hundreds of millions of years ago   you mean they're like creatures from the past   no  i mean they are creatures from the past   brilliant  just brilliant   oh  that was my front door key     cutter  we have to go now    you've got your own experts   they didn't see what we saw   and they don't know what you know   you're thinking about helen  aren't you     it explains everything    except why she didn't come back   claudia brown  home office   yes  i've seen your file   james lester  i'll be in charge of coordinating our response   you shouldn't have brought them here  they have no security clearance   i don't like civilians in these situations   how many situations like this have you had   how do we know they're not responsible for all this in some way   that's not possible   you spend your entire career planning for just about every crisis imaginable   up to and including alien invasion  then this happens   so much for thinking outside the bloody box   something large has been through here  recently   i'm not  um  really outdoorsy   i have sinus issues and allergies   i'll write you a list   we can't rely on the army to find this creature   so just keep looking   it's so close i can sense it   shouldn't we just wait for the professor   this phenomenon professor     claudia tells me you have an explanation    a theory   the boy's experience proves that there's a concrete landscape     on the other side of the anomaly   and i think it's the earth many millions of years ago   and this anomaly  as you call it   is a door between time zones in the world's history   suppose this remarkable theory is correct  what are the immediate risks   famine  war  pestilence  the end of the world as we know it   you know  the usual stuff   i think i could do without the facetiousness   well i could do without standing in some anaemic office in whitehall   talking to a civil service pen pusher   when i should be exploring the most significant phenomenon     in the history of science   technically  i'm not actually a civil servant   more a troubleshooter without a portfolio in the pm's office   you mean you're a government hatchet man   colorful  but a surprisingly accurate   and there's something else you should know   i intend to find out what happened to my wife  whatever the risks   so i'm going through the anomaly  and if you want to stop me   then you're going to have to shoot me   i hope we won't come to that   so     what do you think of abby   she's okay  why   i was picking up some heat between us   you get an instinct for these kind of things   i though you already had a girlfriend   she's more of a pen pal really   she  um  she lives in the gambia   that's practical for a night out   yeah     so do you think abby likes me    why don't you ask her yourself   all right  i might   it's not everyday you meet a potential girlfriend   and find a dinosaur   stephen   stephen   you really shouldn't handle a lizard like that   let the experts do their job   they don't know what they're doing   you really shouldn't mess with an angry lizard   i'm terrified   do they even know he can fly   fly   grab it   watch the door   rex     he can fly    hmm  pretty well   it's going up   well  we'll really have to take a view on that    rex   don't do it  rex   it's not your world out there anymore   try some of this   you'll love it   i promise   rex  come back   good decision rex   oh  those risks you were talking about  there's one i didn't tell you about     running down your back   it's so perfect   what's this   i think the scientific term is 'really bad news'   the lizard's dna confirms your theory   the creature's a living fossil   under the circumstances  i'm going to allow your exploratory mission into the anomaly   i'm taking the lizard back   creatures that don't belong here should be returned to their natural habitat   it's a disclaimer  we don't want any nasty lawsuits if you don't come back   okay  my best guess  the creature we found was some kind of scutosaurus   late permian era   that footprint  definitely not the same animal   if we are talking late permian  then this     little charmer is the prime suspect   it's a gorgonopsid   it's a compact killing machine  and it's got incredible power   stephen  if it is still out there  then you have to find it   fast   what about you   you  mighty hunter  me  i'm more logistics and   you know  backup   the sooner you finish your detention ben  the sooner we can both go home   miss   miss  there's a dinosaur in the playground   really ben  how old are you now   no  we've got to get out     ben  sit down now    there's a dinosaur     miss  come on    ben  sit down  calm down   don't open the door   don't open it   pick on someone your own size     will you call stephen again    he's not answering   it's 18 55  i want you back no later than 20 00 hours   if the first contact works out  we'll take it from there   what's he doing here   this is captain ryan  he's a gulf war veteran     with extensive desert experience   we don't know how dangerous it will be on the other side of the anomaly   no arguments  cutter  he goes as well   please take care of him     look after yourself too    yeah  we'll be fine   whatever happens  bring him back   my pen   the magnetic field didn't take it   the anomaly is getting weaker   give me an hour  one hour on my own   i've got a radio   helen   professor   professor  over here   my god   people  somebody's been here before us   well whoever it was they didn't get far  over here   it's 'hc'  it's 'helen cutter'   is it her   no  it's a man   how did he die   i don't know  uh   it's time to go   yeah  i can't help that  i've got to find my wife     we have to go    i'm staying   sorry professor   don't do that again   the anomaly  it's disappearing   quick  do you want to be trapped here forever   i'm staying here to look for my wife   i'm not leaving you behind   well what do you want to do  shoot me   all right  you stay  i stay   that's   that's just childish   all right   look   they're back   what did you see   there's a camp  looks like a military camp   you're not going to believe it   what was it like   we get him up     god  you've got to see it    well done ryan     oh my god    run     cutter    claudia   quick   stephen   catch   we developed the film in the camera you brought back   it's her  it's helen   i'm sorry for your personal loss  professor   this camp that you discovered   there were no clues as to who made it  or what it was for   the thought that someone was there before us is far from reassuring   and i used to think the eu common agricultural policy was far fetched   still  at least the immediate crisis is over   some  force  out there   ripped the boundaries of space and time to shreds   maybe it's happened before  in which case   every single thing we thought we knew about the universe is wrong   or  this is the first time  in which case  what changed  what happens next   believe me  it's very  very far from over   hello   helen   helen
