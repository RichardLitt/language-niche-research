reckons duffy's the actor alan daniels   this is john mcdowell  two counts of gbh  both on women   it's been a real pleasure meeting you   you think it could be the two of them  could be   i had a phone call last night  alan daniels asking me to some ballet   mcdowell  i wanna talk to you  piss off   come on  then   get down there   drone of hair dryer i've done fuck all  bastards   hello  who is it   it's your boss   come in   intercom buzzes  knock at door  what are you doing here  keeping an eye on you   give us a twirl   it's going back tomorrow   too right  it is   i want you to be absolutely clear where we're going with this   you follow parks' advice  you offer up a few case details to daniels   you flatter him  you try and draw him out   and you take absolutely no risks whatsoever  you understand   good   i'll have a drop of that   the car should be here in about ten minutes   good luck   good evening  anna  you look absolutely beautiful   thank you   that's a very elegant outfit   really  yeah  thanks   i got it for half price  wore it in a movie   now  these    well  these i'm not so sure about   what do you think  oh  they're lovely   yeah  lovely  rent a frock   did you have any problem leaving work early today   no  i said it was a family matter   naughty  told a fib   well  i don't think my boss would appreciate me seeing you socially   why  surely i'm not still a suspect   no  of course not  just the fact that you've been questioned   big fan of the ballet  aah   and you  mr daniels   it's alan  for god's sake   and thank you for agreeing to come out tonight   you really do look beautiful   we're going to have a fantastic evening   i promise   yeah  i look forward to it   good to see you       georges bizet  habanera from carmen  i shouldn't be telling you all this  i've drunk too much champagne   we should never talk about the cases we're working on   i find it really hard to believe this guy has got away with it   and even harder to believe that you don't have a single clue to his identity   i mean  that said  it's bloody terrifying to think  you actually had me questioned and  for a minute there     thank you    thought that i might be involved   the man must be a bloody monster   he's also very intelligent  he never leaves any dna  no fingerprints   nothing   christ  how many people has he killed  eight   that's including the american murder   that's another reason why you were questioned   you were in america at the same time   my boss has been through all the dead files   ah  now i understand   alan  if you were to be questioned again   you mustn't mention any of this   i could get into terrible trouble   of course  i wouldn't say it to a soul   why would they want to re question me  i thought you said i wasn't a suspect  you're not   you lived at shalcott street  and so did most of the victims   it's just    it's a terrible coincidence   shalcott street   all i've ever done       is try to block that from my memory   is that such a crime  no   i was just a little boy       brought up in a brothel   she'd lock me in a cupboard under the stairs  but       but that doesn't make me a killer   why are they doing this to me   god  bloody shalcott street  i     i'm sorry  i promised you a good evening and     excuse me  mr daniels  can i have your autograph  please  erm     yes  yes  of course  thank you   it's a pleasure  i loved your movie  oh  i'm glad   there you go  have a lovely evening  thank you   work  hmm   alan  this has been lovely  but i've got an early call tomorrow  so

 thank you for tonight  no  no  no  thank you   thank you so much  good night   go walkies   get in   let me out   yes   it's me  langton    did you get the text  yeah  you told him about the handbag   i was supposed to  wasn't i  yes  how did he react   what did he say about mcdowell  he just said that it proved he was innocent   went on about his childhood all night  i mean     well  do you think he is innocent   i think he might be  sir   oh   he might be   might he   is that because you had a hot session with him   a hot what  sir   the driver reported he was all over you like a rash   the driver  mm hm   oh  undercover  was he  yep  terrific  that's just great  sir   thanks  come on  we had to protect you somehow  protect me  by telling me everything   he also mentioned you drank an awful lot of champagne   i had one glass  sir  no  you had more  travis   sorry  god  you smell nice   we'll pick this up in the morning  all right   good night   good morning   i heard you had a good night  it's him  it's langton   he scratched my car   again   god  i think i'm in love   do you know any of these women  mr mcdowell  yeah  i know them   can you explain to me why handbags belonging to them were found in your flat  no   do you recognise any of these  no   well  it's a squat  people are in and out all the time   you'd be surprised what i've woke up with   they could have been dumped by anybody  i've never seen 'em   are you trying to tell me that kathleen keegan's dead  as well   i'm being set up for something here   look  i admit having the drugs in the car   but i've never seen this slag for ten years   you have stated that you were only at lillian duffy's house in shalcott street    a couple of times  yeah   so did you ever see her son anthony duffy there   sometimes  but then he was always being yanked away to foster care  and the bitch would drag him back again   so when was the last time you saw him   around the time she was strangled   she deserved it  we all reckoned he'd done it   why did you reckon that  he had more reason than anyone else   well  she knocked him about   you just told me that you only went to shalcott street a couple of times   from what you say  you seem to have been a regular visitor   i was down on my luck  i lost my club  i lost my car    yeah  yeah  shalcott street   when i was in need of a doss  that's where i went   but when did you say was the last time you saw anthony duffy   oh  jesus    now  for all i know   so you haven't been in contact with him over the past few months   you're not listening   i just said i haven't seen him for 20 years   i'm not feeling very well   need a break   i need a bottle of vodka  but i doubt you'll give it to me   they also found a suitcase full of women's underwear at your place   not  women's    one woman   beryl   i kept them  i loved her   i was working in manchester when she was killed   broke my heart   look  i don't know anything  you know   my mind's gone  it's not what it was   i just work the door at the pub   i'm paid with drinks   do you know this girl   she's a looker    but i don't know her   where were you on the 7th of june this year   oh  jesus  holy god   my mind's shut   remember     i know exactly where i was on june 7th   it's my birthday   where were you  mr mcdowell   held in solihull police station for drunk driving   he may have done the honours  but mcdowell's in the clear for melissa   he was in solihull bloody nick at the time   why you couldn't have found that out before he was dragged down here    i've traced him  what   daniel's unit driver  he's been in madagascar driving russell crowe   is there a bloody point to this  joan   he says he drove daniels to london  he was here when melissa was killed   right  we pick him up first thing in the morning   we search his place again  we rip it apart   my receipts for last night  sir   is alan daniels the only suspect   mr daniels is helping the police  in connection with the murder of melissa stephens   this is all nonsense  it's all nonsense   right  gentlemen  i want this place taken apart  let's get on it   we'd better find something after putting him through that   did he know we were tipped off  what do you think   is he going to be charged with murder   alan  i'm sorry i couldn't get here earlier   i've been held up by traffic  it's getting ridiculous   they've taken everything   my scarf  tie  shoes  shoelaces  cuff links     you've got to get me out of here   full stop   i might not be able to do that  alan   right  mr radcliff  gentlemen  please take a seat   and the time is 10 05am   was your unit driver roger thornton   yes  i believe he was   mr thornton has given us a statement  saying that he drove you from cornwall  to your flat in earls court on june 6th  for the drive back to cornwall  on june 8th  he said you did not use him for the 7th   so on the evening of june 7th  did you drive your mercedes   very possible   did you give melissa stephens a lift  no  i didn't   get in  no   paul   do you know a john mcdowell  mr daniels   from manchester   ring any bells  yes  yes  that's him   the   the man i was telling travis about   when did you see him last  oh  that's a good question   erm  it's gotta be at least     what  16  no  probably longer   20 years ago   and   what kind of man was he   from what i can remember  flashy  loud mouthed  wore terrible suits  nasty ties     rang a string of tarts from his health clubs  he was always visiting her place   whose place   er    lillian duffy's  lillian duffy   who's she   she was a     excuse me   she was a prostitute  she ran the house in shalcott street as a brothel   he was always there  doing drugs  apparently  too many   he's now a complete addict   were you born anthony duffy    yes   is the woman in this picture of you as a child       lillian duffy  your mother   there you go  is this your mother  mr daniels    yes   whether i'd describe her as a mother or not  that's a different matter   your mother was murdered  right  yeah  i was informed she had been   a bit more than that  mr daniels   you were arrested and questioned   your mother had previously alleged   no    that you had attacked her   no  no  that's not correct   i was released  there were never any charges brought against me   you've just maintained that you haven't seen mcdowell for 20 years   but that when you did know him  he was successful  running health clubs  yes   so how do you know  20 years later  he's a drug addict   foregone conclusion  mate   he was always out of his head   drink or drugs  take your pick   how do you know his present circumstances   it was a wild guess   i put it to you that you've seen mcdowell recently   and i put it to you  pal   that you're trying to stitch me up on this  why not ask anna travis   she said you found three victims' handbags  in mcdowell's place   we have a tape recording of exactly what detective constable travis told you   she told you that we found  one handbag in mcdowell's place   how did you know there were three   could you please explain to me  mr daniels   why you stated that three handbags were discovered   no   no  i won't   if you've got a fucking recording of everything that bitch said to me   you'll know what i said  bag  bags   what's the bloody difference   alan  just calm down   i think  detective chief inspector langton   it's time you either charged my client  or released him   as far as i can ascertain  you have no evidence  no witness  and no proof whatsoever     bar the fact his mother ran a brothel and abused him    that my client has any connections with these murders   excuse me   for the benefit of the tape  dci langton is leaving the room  at 1600 hours   no  no  no    this is all lies   this is lies  do something about it   i'm innocent  this is going to destroy me   we'll take out an injunction  door opens and closes  dci langton has just re entered the room at 16 01   melissa stephens's handbag   one of the many trophies found in mr daniels' apartment  please sit down   sit down  please   suspenseful music  mr daniels  i am now going to question you  in regard to the murder of melissa stevens   i want       anna travis   i don't want him sitting opposite me   you don't have a choice   you won't get another word out of me  unless she's facing me at this table   not you   do you understand  that is the deal   why does he want to speak to me   he wants to get inside your head   it's not going to be pleasant   but i think we can get a confession out of him this way   ok  ok   mike will pass the photographs over to you in order of the victims' murders   if you think you're going to come unstuck  give him a signal  a tap on the knee  or something   the last thing we want is for him to go down the  no comment  route   if that happens  we're looking at months on the case  ok   you follow protocol  don't forget to caution him again   i'll be right there with you   it's imperative we get a full  detailed confession to these murders   all right  give me a minute   does she know what she's letting herself in for   if she screws up  the press will have a field day   you er    think she can handle it  boss   course she can  she's jack travis's girl   could you please tell me what your relationship was  with the victim lillian duffy   you know what it was  anna  it's dc travis       and for the tape  i require you to tell me   who was she   the bitch that gave birth to me   when i was five  she put me in a bath of scalding hot water   she said she didn't mean to hurt me   she was drunk   the burns festered  and one of her bitches took me to casualty   they sent round the social services   she told them i'd run the bath myself   when they left  she beat the living daylights out of me for causing trouble   she said  if i ever told anyone   she'd drown me next time  i had a terror of baths   did you kill your   don't fucking interrupt me   i'm giving you your motive  you stupid bitch  if you want it  you'll listen   i went to school with bruises and broken arms  legs  teeth     she'd say   he fell downstairs    if i were really sick  she'd put me in a cupboard for days without food or water   whatever condition i were in  she could always lie her way out of it  and say i'd done it to myself  would you tell me    she wouldn't let me go       because she could make money out of me   do you know how she made money  out of a seven year old boy  her own son   i were raped for money   she'd turn me up and watch men       rape me   i was seven   but you know what   you know what   i think i inherited her talent for acting   oh  she could give an oscar winning performance of motherly love   i had to wait a long   long time  yeah     before i were old enough and strong enough   before she were frightened of me   now     now we get to the good part  yeah   the night i killed her  whilst having sexual intercourse with her   oh  yeah  i fucked her   made sure she were watching me   tied her hands behind her back   sitting astride her like she were a donkey   and then i rolled her over       and i wound round her neck  her stinking  dripping tights       and i watched the light go out of her eyes   i was still inside her when she died   she were my first   did you retain any keepsake  what   on the night lillian duffy was murdered   did you take anything from her   oh  i see where you're going with this   fucking brilliant  very good  very proud of you   hey  very insightful   yeah  i did  her handbag   make up  a few quid     i used to make myself up with her stuff   it were a turn on  you know  why was that  mr daniels    why was that  mr daniels   why was that  mr
