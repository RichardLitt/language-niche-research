just show his head that's the same as on anyone   can we put him on the table please  so we can just see     well  i don't think i should  get on the table so we can see you're a bloody dwarf   what are you doing   all right  ok  if i just get on the chair is that ok   get on a chair   ok  right  you see   ok  you ready  ok  let's do it   i'm here with warwick davis  from star wars  and others  go   yeah  um  i was in  er  star wars  return of the jedi    yes   played wicket the ewok   er  i was in the harry potter films  of course   the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy  yeah  time bandits  no  i wasn't in that   fuck off  cunt  dwarf   fucking hell   cut  sorry  my bad   that's my bad  sorry   have you got any interesting stories about  um  about star wars   well  yeah  i've got a good story about how my grandmother got me the part   shall we do that  ok   right  here we go again   hello  i'm with warwick davis  star dwarf  star wars dwarf   go on  how d'you get that part   i was 11 and my grandmother was listening to the radio     oh  my god  the a team van  the a team van   good  ok   he's gone to interview what is essentially a second hand car   not a massive earner today  made 250 quid   which is why we're going to have a brainstorming session   do you know what that is  it just    throw out any money making ideas you've got  right   brain storming  ok   i'll make some notes   we'll start with number one  ok   in your own time   the company is called dwarves for hire  is that right   yes  it is  yeah  yeah   why do you have to only do acting  could you do other stuff  such as   chimney sweep   chimney sweep  why am i suddenly doing that   well  it used to be children  didn't it  100 years ago  yeah   but it's cruel to send children up there nowadays  so     so it's not cruel to send a dwarf up there   no  because you're an adult  aren't you  oh  are you not  oh  i thought you're an adult   yeah  of course i'm an adult   but i'm also a businessman and i've been in loads of big films   why am i suddenly running up chimneys   you wouldn't have to run up there  i could help you up   right so  so your business idea is you shoving me up a chimney   well  you wouldn't actually necessarily have to go up there at all   when my gran used to have her chimney cleaned  the bloke  would come round  cover everything up with sheets then stick a long brush up there  you could do that   right  so now i'm not even taking advantage of my size   i'm just a chimney sweep   or i could be at the bottom  and you could be at the end of the pole  cleaning the top of the chimney  doing a great job   and people would come round and go   wow  that is the cleanest chimney ever    how did you do that     i had a dwarf on a pole     which one    warwick davis     who's warwick davis    he's an actor     what's he been in    films     which ones     i can't remember    these ones    right  that idea's safe   um  make a note   dwarf on pole    good  um  moving on to number two   you could do other stuff that's too dangerous for children   like what   you could be used as bait to catch a paedophile   go on  how would this work   you in a little dress  with bunches in your hair   just playing in the woods waiting for paedophiles to come up to you   and molest you   why am i dressed as a little girl  why can't i be a boy   i don't think there's any gay paedophiles   there's loads of gay paedophiles   also  they won't have done anything wrong because if a paedophile comes up to me and offers me some sweets   all he's done is give a dwarf some sweets  that's not illegal   what happens if a real kid comes over and wants to play   i'm a grown man dressed as a little girl playing with a kid in the woods   straight to prison  next   you could hide in places too small for other people to hide in   i don't even know what job that is   forget it   it's just  it's not working   just     there's nothing come in  no job offers at all   no  nothing really  oh   oh  oh  yeah  johnny depp's agent called   what   give it     you didn't want to mention this   'so johnny is doing this movie  it's called tim burton's rumpelstiltskin   'tim is directing  obviously  it is johnny and helen bonham carter   'johnny will be playing rumpelstiltskin  an evil dwarf from the classic fairy tale ' ok   'but you may know johnny's a real method actor   'he spends a lot of time researching his roles  'and he wants to meet and understand what it's like to be a little person '  fantastic  he's made the right decision   i totally understand what it's like to be a little person   'great  obviously johnny will pay you for your time   'we thought a week's work  monday to friday    1 000 a day     5 000   'yeah  is that ok '  yeah  that's good  yeah   'are you free from monday next week '  er  let's just  er  just check the old diary   er  it's pretty chocca so  er  you know  we'll have to shift a few things around   you've got nothing but a back wax   yeah  no  i'm all set  great   'great  johnny will see you at the dorchester at ten o'clock monday ' ok  see you then  bye   'bye ' oh   oh  i can't believe you're meeting johnny depp   he is my favourite film star   he's one of the handsomest men on earth  and he's intelligent   and brilliant at acting  and rich   probably wouldn't go out with me  though  would he  probably not   course  he's married  isn't he   he is sadly  otherwise you'd be straight in there   not bad  is it  being a muse to one of the biggest movie stars of all time   i'm not going to tell him how to say his lines  no   i'm not going to tell him how to play a dwarf   i'm going to tell him how to be a dwarf   how to think like a dwarf  how to feel like a dwarf   then they'll use special effects to make him small like a dwarf   team effort   hello  oh  ho ho  wow   that's perfect  ok  it's perfect  yeah you just  just move     all right  just go and do whatever you would normally do   crazy little walk  where do you sit   on like a chair  sofa  or like  er  on the floor  cross legged   can you actually  can you do cross legged   not really  i just normally sit in a chair  really  yeah  shall we  shall i sit down   yeah  yeah  please  please   wow     he hopped on the chair   it's  it's great  cool   he's kind of like a grub coming out of an apple   seeing the world for the first time   all right   so may i ask you a question  mm hm  if you were struck by lightning   bolt of lightning  bam   right  yeah  what do you do   dead  maybe not  ok   can i just see you out of that chair   on that floor   standing here like this  yeah   just you and me  yeah  we're standing here talking   bang bang  bang bang  bang bang  bam  ba   a bolt of lightning is going to knock you down  ok   bam  ah  oh  stand up   fucking stand up  that's great   ah  that noise  yeah  noise is fantastic  let's do the noise again   cool  right   agh  agh  agh  agh   agh  aghhhh  that's fantastic  oh  god that's great  yeah  cool  that's really great   it's like a    it's like a weird baby crow that's been left by its mother   and the little legs started flailing   did they  and  er    yeah  they did  sorry  i'm just making notes   have you heard of  erm    michael flatley   er  yeah  yes  hmm   the lord of the dance  oh  yeah   right  here we go  you and me  yeah  what are we going to do  the lord of the dance   faster   fucking give me passion   no  come on   that's not michael flatley   lord of the dance  yeah  lord of the dance  yeah   faster  faster  more  more   so  there's one scene   er    that i need to see   cos at one point  rumpelstiltskin climbs up through the sewers     right    to escape the villagers   ok  ok  yeah  yeah   how do you want to do that   oh  boy  oh  boy   oh  god  it's far too much   it's an evil toilet dwarf   yeah   ugh  ugh  ugh  ok   ugh  ooo ugh   how do you feel   erm  feet are a bit wet  to be honest   so what is a typical day for you   um  i want to see what you do  i want to see what you do  how you do it   what you do  same as you probably  really   um  just sort of having important meetings  doing some brilliant acting  mm   um  hanging out with famous people  sort of thing   like  who like   other dwarves  like tiny men   sometimes  er  yeah  but  i mean  today   i'm going to cruise down and meet a couple of good friends of mine     ricky gervais

at the golden globes   that was a while ago  they were jokes  johnny     oh  they were jokes  yeah  you like jokes  yes   good  cos i got together with a few pals  after the awards   and we wrote some jokes     about you   and i want you to know this  i want you to carry this with you for the rest of your days   no one makes fun of tim allen on my watch     and gets away with it   don't say anything  just keep that in you  ok   here are my jokes   what is nastier than ricky gervais's jokes   his teeth   why do people instantly dislike ricky gervais  because it saves time   ha  ha  ha  ha   why did ricky gervais do a series of audio books   so that the blind could hate him as well   now  this is from angelina    tell ricky gervais that me and brad have a picture of him on our mantelpiece    because it keeps the kids away from the fire    and why isn't ricky gervais circumcised   because there's no end to that prick   did you quit twitter recently   well  about two years

joke  what's the joke   i hear that ricky gervais quit twitter recently because it only has 140 characters   well  that's 139 more characters  than he's ever come up with   good joke  the telling of it took about as long as long as  pirates of the caribbean 3  but yeah  it's a good joke   you're laughing   well  it's just     you fucking laughed  mm    what  are you dissing pirates now   no  really  it's a good movie  i thought it was     just a bit long though  which he picked up on   people love that movie  oh  yeah   what is wrong with you people   seriously  why do you pick on movie

nilly if they're not bringing anything to the table   you didn't bring the ewok costume   why would i walk around with a costume   that was for a film  why do you actually need me   anyone could walk

great  yes  get the stinky bear  excuse me  i'm still here  you know   and  finally  just like to say a few words about  emma's grandmother  vera  who sadly passed away very recently   we're certain that she's looking down on us today wishing them all the love in the world   so please raise your glasses as we toast the bride and     whoa  whoa  whoa  hang on a minute  hang on   let's not go out on a dead gran  let's have a bit of a laugh here   um  here we go  just  er  hop up   oh  thank you very much  i will take that   i'd just like to say a few words  let's end on a high     that's a good effort but a bit depressing for a wedding   i'm warwick and i'm the other best man and i'm going to keep this speech short  like myself   the groom is not just a huge fan of mine but he's also a huge  a cricket fan and i know he's been waiting to find out the test results   it's all right  mate  they're negative   and there's only one thing that's hit more balls  than ian botham's bat  and that's emma's chin   traditionally  the best man's speech is when you make the groom feel uncomfortable for five minutes   which is exactly what nigel does to emma in bed   i mean  he makes her feel uncomfortable as he's not very good in bed   not cos he's making her do something she doesn't want to do   like forcing her to do anal   ok   um  er  and looking around the room you know i can see  you're thinking if i'm the best man  why is nigel marrying emma   cos i didn't get her pregnant   what's  what's the matter with her  what      she can't have kids  what   she can't have children   there's no way i could have known she's barren   this is ridiculous   it's ridiculous  you've got to chill out  honestly   you don't know how lucky you are to have me here   twat   big laughs and thanks for that   so     emma's gran   emma's gran   emma's gran   she needs a drink   'what a week   'it started off so well '  star of a convention  didn't make any money   then johnny depp comes along  supposed to get five grand  i blow that   and then get paid to come to a wedding   blew that   what am i doing   sometimes i seriously think i should just give up this lark and get a proper job
