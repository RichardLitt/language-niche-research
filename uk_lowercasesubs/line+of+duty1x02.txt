wesley's solicitor  lis burton   you've both had the benefit of disclosure  so you're aware  that we have evidence that wesley was a frequent visitor  of the house on greek lane  tell me what you were buying   hard food  white boy   no  i was just borrowing some dvds   i see   so  you would take away some dvds   come back the next night and what  borrow some more   that's correct  disclosure of evidence and four hours  and this is the story you've cooked up  all right   i would be very disappointed if you couldn't tell me  the titles of some of those dvds   iron man 2  kick ass  piranha 3d  except not in 3d   yeah  all right  wesley  well done   but what i really want to know is  those lads who were lending  the dvds  who were they and where were they getting their dvds from   they were just some lads that was into dvds  innit   thing is  wesley  those lads were brutally murdered and you are  the only person that we can connect to that house   and that makes you prime suspect  mr duke had nothing to do  with the murder and you know it   wesley  where were you between the hours of 11pm  on wednesday the 4th and 6am on thursday the 5th   no comment  no alibi offered at first interview   my line of inquirys  they're going to hit you like a steamroller  if you don't stop feeding me this pack of porkies   my client strenuously denies the allegation   you have no forensic evidence as per disclosure   this is going to be a compensation claim for wrongful arrest   have him  tone   ok   interview terminated   thank you very much  wesley   you've been a great help  what you mean   as a token of our gratitude for the information you've provided   i'll have you returned home in a marked police car   he'll thank you warmly in front of the whole estate   then i'll get our community policing operations  to make a blatant point of turning a blind eye  to all of your activities   he's just turned a ferret into a rat   whoa  whoa  my client is absolutely not a police informer   so   interview continued  how long were they operating out of that house   not long  a month  tops   and where were they from   some arabs or muslims or something   what were their names  wesley  ali    ahmed    how am i supposed to know   do you know where were they getting their supply  of dvds   they never said  they had loads   good quality  not mixed up or nothing   all right  now we're getting somewhere  i need one more fact   anything  wesley  help me to help you out here   it came in some white sacks   they  they came in some white sacks   can i go now   no   not with our

taken over your case   if you come with me  i'll see if he's available   officer of the year   ms laverty  isn't it   would you like to come into my office  please  i'd be happy to   thank you  rita   you're welcome  sir   can you leave the door open  please   thank you   have a seat   so i welcome this opportunity to bring you up to speed  miss laverty   we're satisfied there was a break in at your home  that enabled the thieves to steal your vehicle   fatal hit and run with a pedestrian   we've looked at identifying the victim through missing persons   there was an individual who appeared to match the deceased   however  that is no longer an active line of enquiry   your case remains open and unsolved   just in case you think of contacting me again   i hope that clarifies the situation  ms laverty   i see   rita  could you show ms laverty out  please   steve  i just had a call from kate   i skimmed the hit and run file  sir  it's a red herring   don't you think it's curious that the officer of the year  should be involving himself in a hit and run incident   he knows we're on to him and he's deliberately taken  on a low profile case with virtually zero chance of clean up   what i do have  sir   is a pattern of laddering going back years   gates selects an open and shut case and bumps up additional charges   he's clearing four crimes for every one that's actually committed   tony gates  eh   he's your bent copper for the 21st century   steve  when i first came over here  there was ten bent coppers  to every station   minimum  we didn't put our house in order   these new procedures  we brought them on ourselves   and gates is using this messed up system to get to the top   but why  steve  why is he doing it   what's in this for him  hm   hiya  hey   hi there  how you doing   the performance is just there on the left   medium latte  thank you   what's your name  nadzia   hawaii five o   could i ask you some questions please  nadzia   should i ask for a lawyer first

there was a mugging outside and he intervened  i remember   does he regularly receive free meals   no  he never came in before   some officers make sure everyone knows they're in the job   fishing for special treatment  they were quiet  no trouble   he was with someone   yes   another police officer   i don't know  but she didn't do anything to stop the mugging  like he did   a woman   yes   young  old  attractive   you mean do i think she was his girlfriend   was she   is it a problem for policemen in this country to have girlfriends   it depends who the girl is   she mustn't be a criminal   exactly   or a witness   do you remember the woman well enough to give me a description   tall  slim  dark hair   mid forties  well dressed   so  your new boyfriend's ex girlfriend's been on facebook

having a brilliant day   what will help you enormously when it comes to sentencing   is if you agree for other offences to be taken into consideration   tic  oh  nice one  yeah  i don't want prison   i've got benidorm booked   there was a house burgled in edge park  yeah  i did that   lock up garages in moss heath   yeah  that was me  yeah   a hairdresser's in moss heath  did that  yeah   house

get up   i'm devastated by what's happened to you   i know you're angry and upset   and you're entirely within your rights to lodge a complaint   well  i'm the last bloke who'd want to say a bad word against the police   i believe you  sir  and i've got some good news   we've arrested a burglar who confessed to robbing your property   what  the one who attacked me   he didn't confess to that   oh  well  it'll be the one from before  the one who took my telly   well  i can certainly look into it for you  sir  yeah   mr butterfield  i can see that you don't want frontline officers  tied to desks while your attacker's still out there   you have no idea of the hours  days   of admin required to process a complaint   give us the chance to work for you instead   thank you  someone will be along to see you shortly   oh  hi  sir  hiya  i am going to talk to uniform   put a priority on this bloke the next time he triple 9's   oh  would you  sir  you're part of my team now  kate   means i don't stand by and let you carry something like this on your own   oh  thank you  sir   i see what the highest detection rate in the region buys you   we'd better crack these murders  or i'll be trading her in for a reliant robin   best job cars  best job phones and computers   it must've been hard getting on this squad   for a while it was touch and go whether i'd ever get out from behind a desk   what happened  nige  if you don't mind me asking   i took a bullet for one of the lads   really   you think about throwing in the towel  retiring   tony gave me back the motivation  he's a good man   you remember that   yeah   wesley referred to a large supply of drugs in little white sacks   whoever killed them appears to have stolen the stash   maybe it's just really well hidden and no one's found it yet   i never saw your motor outside   it's parked across the street  nige  oh   are you seeing what i'm seeing   i am  sir   sir   nothing  bollocks   we'll find it  nige  get a search team in here   what  now or    yeah  now  please  cheers  mate  all right   we'll need something sharp to get the rest of these up   well  we won't be able to use nige then  will we  sir   slow but sure sometimes wins the race  kate   did you bring me into the squad for the same reason  i'm not following you   well  i'm more than just another tick off the diversity box   somebody said something they shouldn't   it doesn't matter what other people say  it's what you say   i say you're a good detective   which is rare seeing as no one bothers training you lot any more   but that's not the whole reason you appointed me  is it   you're a good detective   hilton's the one who cares about ticking boxes   i care about cracking cases  yeah  me too  sir   i need copies of all the original documentation  relating to a hit and run  crime number g89635   just get a photo   do you think ac 12 have targets too   cos that tosser's only going to hit someone else's  oh   good day at the office  dci gates   one call and you're on a harassment charge   yeah  i could do the same for your goons   if you want to talk to me  arnott   call me into ac 12  we'll do it in front of my federation rep   why bother when i'm only after a minor detail   the reason you took over a hit and run   i mean  it's hardly officer of the year material   it may harm your defence  if you do not mention when questioned     i expect you know the rest   i received information that the incident in question  was connected to one of my team's ongoing investigations   that information was wrong  you haven't bounced it back to traffic yet   hey  i am the senior investigating officer on a double murder   that is proper policing  son  maybe you remember it   i'll wait for those documents  thank you   he could feel his grandfather's spirit  reaching out across the years   urging him to take the first big step   scott took a deep breath and then he said for all to hear    i'm ready   ok  bedtime  please   can't we have another story   no  no  i'll be reading all night  go   just one     no  darling  it's time for bed  let's go   thank you   daddy  yep  can i have a drink   you've brushed your teeth so only water   i don't like water   go to sleep  please   good night  guys   i'm sorry about going along with the banter today   i don't give a toss   what pisses me off is going to hastings behind my back   every piece of information i feed you risks blowing my cover   well  i did get into the hit and run  in my own way   the vehicle was reported stolen by jackie laverty  a property developer   she came to the station  they talked   something felt odd   during breakfastgate   gates was with a woman in the cafe  described as tall  slim  dark hair   you think she's his girlfriend   well  she doesn't appear in his statement   she isn't named as a witness   suppose jackie laverty is gates' bit on the side   she goes to him  damsel in distress     and needs him to make sure no one challenges her alibi   minimum  that's perverting the course of justice   anything on the victim   no  no id yet  i'm going to start working on it   and getting everything on her   ok   'night  yeah  see you   is everything ok  yeah  she just had a bad dream   but she's off now   i'm so proud of you today  well done  sweetheart   do you want a cup of tea  yeah  just  give me five   ok   hello  'i

vehicle   early  idiot   are you the proprietor of this hairdressing business  sir   manager  not chief stylist   what do you want   i'm following up on a burglary that occurred some weeks ago   i understand these premises are owned by laverty holdings  sure   do you know ms laverty  she's the owner   blonde  big lady   that's her  anything else   no   deepak   so what's the twat been up to

he's my problem and mine alone   i mean     cos we're a team  deepak  and that should mean something to you   of course it does  sir   cos if you want out  son  there's plenty in line   he was checking out a hairdresser's on the bog  sir   it's a burglary tic   that's it  yeah   is something wrong  sir   no  it's all good   cheers  mate   these units are available right now  yes  absolutely  yes   we've got the cash flow  for immediate uptake for 15 per cent off the asking price    mark  could you find out what that gentleman in the suit wants   you already have four units at a discounted price     can i help you  mate   yes  but don't you think that gives me a bit more leverage  for some understanding   excuse me  could you just give me a moment  please   mark  it's ok  it's all right   ms laverty  yes   detective sergeant steve arnott   you're here to declare an interest in commercial units   how can i help you  you must be doing well for yourself  given the economic climate   we've made shrewd investments    estimated annual revenue from white collar crime   of conventional robbery   am i being accused of something   a month ago  your hairdressing business in moss heath was burgled   we only own those premises   the business operating there is an independent commercial entity   well  when i questioned him earlier today   the manager of the salon indicated  there was a direct business relationship with you personally   he didn't seem to know you from adam  why should he know me   that's true  you have dozens of these places  don't you   and today you appear to be taking an interest in market units   maybe you'd like to discuss this somewhere less public   i'm very happy to cooperate with your investigation   but as this is a commercially sensitive area   i'd prefer my solicitor was present to verify all the small details   are you familiar with the term  captive business    services paid for in cash with no paper trail or id   earnings from illegal activities can be hidden  through the books of salons  market stalls etc   all the money goes to the bank and bingo  it's clean   i'm in the middle of a meeting    laundered money finds its way back to criminal interests  while the launderer takes his cut  or hers   like i said  i'm happy to cooperate   as you were when your stolen vehicle was used in a hit and run  yes   the officer in charge of that case  detective chief inspector tony gates   d'you know him   i met him briefly at the police station   that's the extent of your relationship   see  i have a witness to your breakfast in kingsgate  the morning before your car was stolen   ms laverty  you'll attend anticorruption unit 12   located at this address  with your solicitor at 9am tomorrow  to be interviewed under police caution  by myself and my superior  superintendent hastings   if you do not have a solicitor  one will be appointed for you   i'm not arresting you at this time   but if you fail to attend  a warrant will be issued for your arrest   do you understand  ms laverty   what's going on   let's talk outside   the coroner's set the date to reopen the inquest in the karim ali shooting   you're going to be asked to testify  only to be expected   but the firearms officers are revisiting their statements   they're saying you sent them to the wrong flat   i'm fighting your corner   but this can't not affect your position here  steve   i thought we were going over the greek lane files again  sir   we'll do it tomorrow  yeah  well  what about the duty super   did you get her to sign off on the extra forensics   you're a lying bitch  arnott's onto you   i don't know how   the hairdressers  jackie  the flea pit over at moss heath   you might as well have hung up a sign saying   launder your drug money here    you stupid bloody bitch  please  listen to me   the accountant found out about it  didn't he  tony     no  he saw the dirty money  going through the books and he decided to talk   so you lured him out to the country and then you ran the poor bugger over  didn't you  tony     i'm not some 25 year old that's wet behind the ears   that was the sap that fell for all your lies   they weren't lies  i loved andrew   no  you loved his money  jackie   look  i know that i've hurt you  but haven't i made it up to you   jacqueline laverty  i'm arresting you for manslaughter  no  tony     that may harm your defence  if you do not mention when questioned    you're hurting me    something that you later rely on in court   don't do this  please   may be used in evidence against you   no  no  no  no  please don't do this  please don't do this   no  please don't do this   this is happening  jackie  ok   please don't do this  please don't    come on   i never

you'll go to prison   what's that like  tony  for a policeman   on the special wing  with all the psychos and the paedophiles   it's never going to happen   your wife will know about us  your daughters   what will they think of their daddy   don't talk about my kids   it's not your future or mine   it's theirs   tony     poor baby   i can fix this   we'll fix it  leave it to me   'ds arnott  please leave a number and a message  'and i'll call you back '  steve  it's me  something's happened   gates went off in a weird mood earlier   no one knows where he is   i can't track him
