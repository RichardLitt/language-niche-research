the father of teenager leanne wray  who went missing a month ago   has again appealed for information as to her whereabouts   east yorkshire police refused to formally link the disappearance  of a teenager girl from the north of the city  with four other girls who have gone missing in the past year   and there is speculation that a serial killer is responsible     families of the five missing girls  local mps and community leaders  are today demanding answers from the police  as to why the investigation appears to have reached a dead end         the disappearance of yet another teenage girl   local schools and youth organisations  are joining to warn young women of the dangers of walking alone      control to 2646  come in 2646    'domestic dispute reported at 27 the hill  can you respond  over   there in five minutes  over     dennis    yeah   domestic   joyriding and a domestic in one night  eh  lucky us   try this one  janet   how d'you know et's a feminist   go on   he looks like one     you're laughing    i'm not laughing   there it is  37     here we go    that's it   hello   anyone in     what    dennis   it's ok  you go  i've got her   it's ok  love  you're ok  we're here     i'll check upstairs  yeah    yeah     2646  control  over    2646  go ahead   ambulance at 27 the hill   unconscious female with head injuries  over   control to 2646  received     nothing    what about in there   yeah   hiya  love  you're safe  can you hear me   can you tell me your name   janet   look  i'll be back in a second  the ambulance is on its way   janet     police   can you open up  please     what the       down here    hello   please  he's bleeding  please  god  help him   extend the crime scene that way as far as number thirty three  right     win    thanks  boss   is it the girls     we think so    go on then   neighbour there calls the police cos she hears screams   pcs dennis morrissey and janet taylor respond   thought it was a routine domestic   and   i think you'd better see for yourself  sir   right  everybody out  ten minute break   right  the house is owned by marcus and lucy payne   young marrieds  no kids   our people kicked the door in and found lucy payne bleeding on the carpet   she'd been assaulted  she's in hospital   they say she'll be able to talk by tomorrow   the pcs come down here in pursuit of a suspect   again  they force the door   suspect marcus payne goes for dennis with a machete   slashes him several times before he's disabled  and cuffed by pc taylor   by the time the paramedics arrived  dennis was dead   marcus payne's in hospital  getting treatment for head injuries   kimberley myers   marcus payne taught her at school   his car     fits the description of the abduction vehicle   my guess is  once he abducted them  he took them out of the car  straight through here   unseen by neighbours or passers by   he didn't record anything  that's a live feed   all the standard serial killer traits are present and correct   hardcore    very hardcore    porn   ritual  strangulation  torture   and    and there's that   you know  i thought    well  i hoped     you know  five girls gone   maybe there was some connection we'd missed   ma maybe they'd all met up and move     gone off to thailand or somewhere   you know  we'd find them lying stoned on a beach somewhere   sir   ok  win   get the artillery   sir   four  that's only four bodies   kimberley myers and three others in his storeroom   so one might still be alive   yeah  or hidden elsewhere in the house   i'm just being realistic  sir   we'll have to take the house apart  and the garden   how long before we get ids   they've x rayed the teeth in situ   late afternoon   i'm going to the hospital   i thought payne was still in a coma   i'll wake him up   banks   what's going on   how do you know about this  jackie   is my leanne in there   my little girl  is she in there   i can't say anything at the moment     we don't have confirm      can't say at the moment   pursuing lines of inquiry   months we've had this crap  five lasses missing   i'm trying  ok   all right   speculation is running high that a violent incident   involve a police officer   in the early hours of the morning  at northwest of the city may be conected to the disappearances     excuse me    you can't go in there   really   i need to speak to him   i'm afraid you can't  he's in a coma   he's just had emergency surgery to relieve the subdural haemotoma   i'll have to go in again to remove several skull fragments   when do i get to question him   i don't think you understand what i'm saying   this is as vicious a beating as i've seen  the copper should be arrested   apart from stabbing one of my officers to death   your patient abducted  raped and tortured at least four young women   a fifth girl is still missing   i need to find out where she is  and i need him to tell me   so  i don't give a shit if he spends the rest of his life  dribbling in a wheelchair   wake him up   call me    as soon as he revives   three months earlier  hi   i thought it was you   i live across the street  number 27  lucy    lucy payne    maggie forrester     oh  you're an artist    just an illustrator   children's books mostly   another one   she disappeared a couple of nights ago   that's three now   i know it's awful  but i suppose we're safe     we're not blonde     all of them  they're blonde    hi   marcus  this is maggie   marcus payne   time to go home  love   can we give you a lift  maggie   that wouldn't be   appropriate  sorry  maggie   come on  love   we'll start with the autopsy report on kimberley myers   ds chapman   death was cause by ligature strangulation   she'd been kept alive for at least four days   bound  gagged  and in that time  repeatedly raped and forced to perform fellatio   socos are still processing the house   so far kimberley myers and three other bodies have been recovered   we should make headway identifying the victims over the next day or so   we have a make and registration on marcus payne's car   ken  i want to you re interview anyone  you think might be able to place marcus payne   or his car  close to the abduction sites   we do not drop the ball on this  until all the victims are returned to their families  and marcus payne is on the end of a guilty verdict  ok   and more important than anything   one of these five girls is still unaccounted for   this is still an open live case   now  maybe she's buried somewhere else in the house   maybe payne kept her alive and incarcerated at another location   or maybe  please god  she's just missing and alive   and nothing to do with this   marcus payne can tell us nothing   we didn't catch him in time   and this morning  we lost one of our own   so we've got a point to prove   now  find me that missing girl   boss   press   thanks     sir    that it  thank you   at the moment  i can confirm at least four bodies have been found  at the address in question   as none of the bodies have been identified positively yet   i am not prepared to comment on the speculation  that they are connected to the disappearances  of five young girls from this area over the last nine months   hi  lucy  d'you fancy a coffee   i   i can't  sorry   you don't have to put up with it  lucy   i didn't   i got away   i came here  my husband can't

with a police officer     right  come on  on the front foot  leanne wray  the fourth girl   your priority in there    find leanne's prints   anything turns up  you let me know  ok   now  it's possible we've assumed too much   maybe leanne's not connected to marcus payne   come on  boss  leanne was young  blonde  she fitted the template   i throw the ball  you fetch it  ok   i want you back to basics  win  treat this as a fresh mispers   re interview everyone surrounding leanne's disappearance   say there's no trace of her in the house   where is she  what happened to her   excuse me   what

investigation too   professional standards   i know it's not frontline     so why work there   i want to make di   at the price of janet taylor's career   d'you know janet taylor  sir   well enough to

my diary   otherwise  there's your crime scene   thank you  sir   you all right   yeah  i'm fine   i said i'm fine   ok   training doesn't prepare you for something like that   it was instinctive   i was scared   just so i'm clear  janet  you  you hit marcus payne on the wrist with your baton     and he dropped the machete    yeah     then what    i kicked the machete away     what did payne do    he went for it     what did you do    i hit him again     where    what  i don't know   there was blood everywhere  and dennis     pc morrissey   yeah     he kept saying he was cold  he was dying   so  you hit payne somewhere  anywhere   as he was about to get the knife   yeah     and    he was stunned   so i got my handcuffs and that  i cuffed him to the rail   leaving you free to attend pc morrissey     yeah    which you did     immediately    yeah   dennis     my priority was to deal with the immediate threat to myself   in order to preserve pc morrissey's life   you and pc morrissey
