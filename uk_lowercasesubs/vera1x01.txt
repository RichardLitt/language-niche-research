always love roses  don't you   ok  rise and shine   holly  what were they  shop bought or what   gathered by hand  according to forensics   but i spoke to a botanist at the uni an hour ago   he's tied up for the rest of the day   but i described them over the phone and he said that they were    wildflowers  found in every ditch in northumberland   basically  yeah    he was targeted  why   anything at all   his head teacher said luke  had learning difficulties   got behavioural reports going back a year or two   ok  he was bored  bit lost   wrong postcode for dyslexia   dad's in his grave   mum's hanging off her hinges  worships the bones of him   and someone climbs in the window   strangles our lad with a length of rope   and then places him in a warm tub  like some poncey installation at the baltic   and then there's his class mate  tommy sharp     tommy sharp    davy's lad   oh  look  it woke up   tell 'em  joe   tommy drowned four months back  whilst playing with our victim by the sea   coroner's verdict  misadventure   now  no blame was attached to luke   they were class mates  best friends apparently   and according to one eyewitness  they were playing peacefully   tommy got carried out by the current  luke went in after him   he was lucky not to drown himself   charlie  blag a copy of the coroner's report     will do    and then comes the memorial   same place as tommy drowned    joe   flowers on the water   they're not wildflowers   no  they look shop bought to me   so  are the flowers on luke  some sort of homage to this other lad   or revenge  reprisal   that's a question i'm hoping to put       to this man   it's tommy's father  davy sharp   walked out of prison nine days ago   been off the radar ever since   'your characters      are more real      than anyone except      i suppose      because  under        made it kinder  what was i thinking    he would count it a blessing        if i fell under a bus    but i will not go quietly    let me out   let me out of here   please  i can't breathe   help me   oh  dad   this is where he was spotted the last couple of days   hello  davy   what you doing here   your family's worried sick   this one of tommy's old haunts  is it   his name was thomas   i need to talk to you  about your son's friend  luke armstrong   i'm afraid he died thursday night   murdered in his own bed  what do you think of that     how did they kill him    a length of rope   you were angry with luke for your son's death   it's all in the report   thomas sharp slipped and fell in the water   his best friend luke tried to save him   but he drowned anyway   still    life goes on  eh   a neighbour just told my sergeant  that you were seen spying on luke's house   he never told his mother  like you   he didn't want to frighten her   what were you following him for  davy   i wanted to hear him say that he tried his best   ma'am   hey  don't you touch that   what were you doing on thursday night     thursday    anyone see you     vouch for you    hey  get your hands off that   don't you touch that  i want yous out of here   i want yous out now  get out   you'd better arrest him  joe   he could do with a decent meal   there we go   i think it's a ring ouzel   it's a blackbird   ring number 64   full female    there you go     cheers    never   no  it's true  one year to go   it's not like it's a trade secret   right       what do you think  jim    it's brilliant   it's not just any clock   you've got to wind it up to the hour       gary's idea    i can see that   chaffinch  chaffinch   song thrush   well  that is     and every hour it's a different garden bird       obscene    just what you always wanted   peter   it's not much  it's     it's a paper bag  very promising   did you do this   we all look half our age   well  we were  it's from an old polaroid   it's our first ever trip  do you remember     up in skye    yeah   skye   thank you  clive  where do we hang it   it's a shoo in for the outdoor khazi     very funny    he's just jealous   oi  where are you sneaking off to     nowhere    i'll come with you if you like   no  gary  you stay put  don't go too far  my love   mum   dad   mum   that's our eyewitness   james calvert  aged nine   one for you  i think   lily marsh was his teacher     what    at the local school in hepworth   she ever teach luke armstrong   there's no chance  she was only there six weeks   part of her training  apparently   what the     hey   get off  which one of you dozy dickwipes  came up with this brave notion   nobody touches the body till forensics get here   that's what they said   get billy cartwright on the phone  now   better   now  that is moist   aren't you clever   thanks   that was a stroke of luck for us   your lad chancing on the victim   it's one way of putting it  i suppose   one more hour  she'd have been swept out to sea   yeah   mind you  the boys were going to walk up to the castle  so     i suppose someone would have seen her     how is he    just gone down   really     my little boy    he'll be ok   a thing like this  though  you just don't know what goes in  do you   jamie adored her   i saw her  you know  she was here yesterday     you never said    yeah   she'd heard about the beach hut  and she came to the house   i was waiting to hear from her     i'm going to go and see him    sweetheart  he'll be fine   i'll just be a minute   dr  calvert     you ever meet the victim  through the university  perhaps   i'm botany   wrong end of campus   i think your sergeant said she was  studying english  wasn't she   what a thing   there's still time to go down to the castle         if we're all done here    that's not really on  is it   no   sorry   so  just to be clear none of you   gentlemen  had ever met the victim   gary's the lady's man   he's joking   i thought i knew your face   yesterday morning you were waiting outside  julie armstrong's house   yeah   what time did you get up here   today   it'd be about two o'clock  was it   i've been at work all morning   so  what  i mean     you work at the sage gateshead don't you   that's right  i was devastated about her boy   she's none too bright herself   that one yours  is it  sir   yeah  how did you know   mind if my lads have a nose inside   no  if it helps     thursday night    what   you spent the evening with julie   then dropped her at the taxi rank   aye  yeah  i fancied a walk   she was under the impression you had to get back to work   was she   no  no  i     it was a big night  it was a lot to take in   i just needed to clear my head    she had all that ahead of her  a waste  don't you think   so  she was in the water  what      a minimum two hours  but she passed her last breath earlier still     when    10  10 30 yesterday morning   she died elsewhere   i imagine she was dragged  see   same as luke   carried over the rocks from the car park   a strong fella   but the last sighting of her was 10 30   yeah  the night before  leaving  the crown posada in the centre of town   what happened to her overnight   she may have been confined   incarcerated  any idea where   i found paint flakes under the nails   could be the boot of a car   land rover   couldn't say     same killer    same murder weapon   or similar  a thin rope   you recall these contusions round the victim's neck   and flowers  those we could save   heather  thrift  rock rose   again  picked not shop bought     a match    yeah     i suppose that rules out davy sharp    for this poor lass   he was with you  wasn't he   not that i want to tell you your job  but     good for you   somebody make some sense of this  joe   a teenage boy  trainee teacher     never met  never spoke  as far as we know   both nice looking  blonde   i don't suppose there was any     you know  interfering   sergeant  you're a gentleman  no  no sign of sexual assault   although   i imagine the young lady was     dressing up for someone   he's off in a hurry  isn't he   now here's julie       pretending to get a taxi   a couple of drunks   should be ashamed of themselves   here's gary  minding his own business   here he comes   now he's running  he's in a hurry   why he's such a hurry   now  where are you going   as far as gary knew  she was getting a taxi   i mean  how was he to know she was getting the slow bus home   he texted her twice on the way of home  asking her not how she was  but where she was   what's this  are you pulling a sickie   i'm on leave  i'm supposed to be   the head's engaged  we're not even packed yet   for the hospital   plus the mother in law's turning up  at five with a case full of ravioli   lucky old you   look at that   i think they're waving at you   come and say hello  they won't bite   another time  perhaps  i've got that much paperwork to do   more interviews  an all nighter i expect  you go on  go   you make the most of your family time   listen  i could send them to the cinema     we've two hours  max    well  if you think  you could manage it  pet     here     what's that    for the cinema  take it   you're very kind   that wouldn't even buy the popcorn   what's this got to do with gary   probably nothing at all   you shouldn't do that   you shouldn't put thoughts like that into my head   gary is a good man   this lass     have you ever seen her before    no   no  i haven't   laura     who is she    is she familiar at all   i almost forgot  this letter came   here   condolence   no  it's addressed to our luke  see   they've got the address wrong  you see   of 20 alba terrace   when did it come   it was yesterday i think  was it   what do you think   innocent enough   how much rent was she paying     580 a month   steep for a trainee teacher   posh end of town   and she was moving out  was she   not according to the flatmate   but she was behind with her rent  apparently   so why the sudden urge to move  into the calverts' beach hut       the day before she died   listen  not much longer  we're just finishing up here   ok  head off  enjoy your half day     you're very kind    i know   yeah  just one or two things     he's local   it's unsealed  so there's no trace of saliva   smart arse   same as luke's   two down   who's next   ma'am   i thought i knew his name   samuel parr  local author  one of the birdwatchers   hi  is julie there   julie   it's gary   sorry   yeah  can you put her on   i just said  didn't i  she can't come to the phone now  bye   thanks  love   thank you   did you write this   shop signing   it's how we shift books these days   standard issue  total bollocks   yeah  the ideal reader is one who leaves you alone   'keep in touch'   hang on   there's an outside chance she's in here somewhere   it's fan mail   daft as it may seem   i don't know what they expect from me   lily      marsh   are you sure you've never met her   she's not my sort at all  if that's what you're getting at   then how do we like our women  mr  parr   you'd be surprised   these letters       you ever write back   seldom even read them  to be honest   you're not tempted  all that devotion   my vanity is more specific   certain people  certain times   this the wife   late wife   sorry   that's ok   paid to snoop   here we go   anything good   i've yet to see them fully clothed   i thought you told us they were farmers   that's what my dad said   poor sod   probably couldn't bring himself to utter the truth   nothing he hated worse than being laughed at   where did he      where did he what  cook  clean  wash his knickers  what   where did he die   in that chair   i'm joking   first landing   who found him   nobody   listen  you're not serious about wanting to move up here  are you   he's only been gone two minutes   six weeks   all it wants is just a bit of tidying up   speaking of which  come here   there's an evil smell  and i can't get the bloody door open   so you want me to have a look   well  seeing as you're here   there's two kinds of birdwatcher  joe   one lot  ganning about with their pagers  and their funny little lists   along comes a bird  not even a rare bird     you see 'em out on the hard shoulder   bins out  mouths open  dead to the world   the other lot     dad's lot   dragging me out of bed seven years old   half asleep in the back of the car  while he's up a tree  stealing eggs off some raptor   it was never enough just to look  he had to tear it apart   see how it worked   he was a bully   or maybe he was just scared   scared of dying alone in a big empty house   did you get a chance to say goodbye   i don't think goodbye would have covered it   what's that   mist net   it's what they use to trap migrant birds   take it up to the lab  will you     a murder weapon    it's standard equipment   still  there's no harm in asking   so we're back onto those witnesses   peter calvert and his groupies   this is not some pet prejudice   she was put in that rock pool  for them to find   i'm sure of it   what   i'm just saying     it's the first murder since your dad passed away   and it's all about birdwatching   maybe it is about birdwatching   what   that was quick   no  hold on  i'll come with you   smart girl  holly   hard work and an open mind   i was just the same when i was her age   right  course you were   mr  craven's a    what is it   a psychiatric social worker   she was the most beautiful girl i'd ever seen   so why dump her  mr  craven   well  too much  too young   plus  i needed to focus on my a levels   so i pulled the plug  i tried to  anyway   lily went off at the deep end  there was letters  e mails   she scared me half to death  to be honest   she was obviously having some kind of breakdown   i think she was even in here for a spell   these corridors must be teeming  with your cast offs  mr  craven     not really    friday night   can you account for your whereabouts     friday      oh  erm    i checked   he was here all night and  the next morning  weren't you  mr  craven   so lily was obsessive   clingy  that's got to be useful     take a look at these    what are they   letters  lily marsh to samuel parr   i can't think why  he's no tom clancy   she seems to have been seeing someone  up to a couple of weeks ago  an older man     ok    and get charlie  to chase up how she was paying the rent  will you   this boy friend  you're thinking sugar daddy   yeah  it would make sense   have you got any ideas who he is  ma'am   i'm drawing up a shortlist   ok   what's joe up to today   sin bin   keeps him sharp   joe   and there  sir  right  cheers   registered to a mr  and mrs blakeworth   unlikely suspects  seeing as they got back  from tenerife two hours ago     prints  forensics    no  no prints   paint flakes in the boot   lily marsh  was she in the boot   it's not confirmed  but it looks like   and   they found this  back seat   mist net   item  one stolen land rover     mist net    possible match for weapon   ruling in our confederacy of birdwatchers   lily marsh  where are we at with the older man   there's no names in the letters to samuel parr   but she talks about him in the first letter     'generous and kind ' she says    dated   six months back  april 17th   two weeks later she's in the posh flat   joe  money   there's between 400 and 600 quid  going into her account every month   cash deposits  before you ask   the last one was   300  six weeks ago   six   so older man ends it   or tries to   and we know lily didn't take kindly to being dumped   what else in those letters  any mention of luke armstrong   no   so what's the link   luke and lily  anybody  daft as you like   gary wright   we've already ruled out his land rover     aye  but he loves the women    who doesn't   maybe he's at it with lily   he moves on to julie   lily wouldn't let go   what  so he murders her   heather   autumn hawkbit   a bit of wild sorrel   nothing you can pin down to a particular place   no   pretty bog standard this time of year   there's no significance you can see   as in   well  the choice of flowers  the arrangement   it seems like     they're laid out     for taste more than anything else   taste   yes  presentation  the look of the thing   i see   you'd need to ask felicity  she's the real gardener   good for you   a strong marriage   those friends of yours must be dead jealous   hardly  i'm forever farming her out   she reads all sam's stories   and dishes out tea and sympathy  when gary's latest love affairs go south   i expect gary has the pick of them  does he  his line of work   i don't think it's half as glamorous as that   look  i really must get started   is this what you call a full house   these days  yes   right       she sent you alone    aye  just the once   let me guess  issues around delegation   you know that thing she does  the country hick thing   doesn't fool me   had peter fooled  though   he's no fool in that picture   no   look how his eyes follow me around the room   they do  don't they   as if rebuking me for my idle thoughts      that's clive for you    clive   artist  stray dog  son that never was   mind you  gary's no better   he's a bit rock'n'roll  is he  gary   it's one way of putting it   they both sulked for years when i showed up   and what about samuel parr   sam   sam's a bit more normal   so   detective sergeant   what can i do you for   the young woman who died  who was interested in your beach hut   i don't know  that was just a mix up  i think   she said that jamie  my son  had     how's he doing     he's getting there    good   thanks   you see  the thing is  that er     there's no evidence she planned  to quit her flat   so i wondered if you thought she was ever really serious at all     about    moving up here   not especially   no  i don't  in fact  i almost wonder  if she was just checking us out   maybe she'd had a row with her boyfriend  or flatmate or     i don't know     well    well  what     did she ravish you    oh  just the once   she had some interesting things to say about you   mr  stringer  how are you   you certainly put the wind up peter   called ahead  did he   just now  i shouldn't mock  should i   good friends  you and dr  calvert   the best  and felicity   point of fact  these past months     well  my mother  you see   she's been under the same roof     well  all my life     she's not been well    she forgets   you go on making excuses for them  then     i wake up  middle of the night    frost on the windscreen   and i finally track her down    she's waltzing up the central reservation in her night dress     nightmare    and felicity  drove me round all the homes   and she gave me the courage  to see i wasn't letting anyone down   so it's just yourself now  then  is it  mr  stringer   well  i've been keepping over  at peter and felicity's when i'm not staying at sam's   i find to my horror that i'm     i'm not much good at living alone   i i know  certifiable these days   hardly   you too   it's not for the faint hearted  is it   no  no  it's not   how about gary wright   you're not tempted to sleep on his sofa   the state of his flat   my immune system couldn't take the beating  besides     well  it's like clapham junction in there     blondes  brunettes  redheads    oh  lucky fella   are you sure you've never seen her before   gary didn't take her home  maybe from a club or      i don't think so   would you tell me if he had   why are you bothering with all this  we were just witnesses   how about     luke armstrong   that one     thomas sharp  a waste of a life   he grew up round the corner from us   we didn't think much of the family   mum had the police out a couple  of times on account of all the noise  but     thomas was canny enough     where will you go    wherever the wind takes me   davy  this anger you've got   it's not the only way of keeping hold of him   i will not believe that thomas just fell in the water     he had a father who loved him      don't   don't think you can just fix it     i can't see straight without him    no  i know  i know that   i open my eyes  and it's all black and white   like one of his bloody pictures   go on   i'm not eating that     it's off    suit yourself   off  my arse   don't fall for the big lie   these cakes will last for weeks  hold that     you're mad  you are    not mad  i'm cheap     i love these    yeah   i'm told thomas was never without his camera   only none of his family seem to know where it is   i hate having my photograph taken   i always look so clumsy  somehow   me too   you look very relaxed here   and here   thomas put you at your ease  did he   i suppose   you were very close  you and thomas   yeah   do you miss him   yeah     your mum know about the pair of you    no   please     we only did it the once   please don't tell her   none of my business   i really need to find that camera  though     i haven't got it    but you know where it is   they had a fight   a fight  thomas and your brother   yeah   the camera went in the water   and thomas    jumped in after it   so that's how he drowned     trying to save his camera    that's what luke said   he made me swear not to tell  or he'd blab to mum   about you and thomas   what were they fighting about   luke wouldn't say   but     go on   all i know is  thomas showed me these pictures on his camera  a few weeks before he drowned   there was this couple   you know     so he'd been peeping   had he  with his camera   every friday afternoon   he was laughing  like it was so funny   and he said  did i want to come and watch   he said he had a plan   'a bit of a laugh'  he said     what kind of laugh    i don't know   and did you   go with him   i'm not a pervert   this couple  in the photographs   did you recognise them   she was really pretty   lily marsh   maybe  yeah   lily marsh in the photograph  are you sure   well  i think so   her mouth  you know   and what about the man with her     i'd never saw him before    old or young   old   i i don't know   the photos were all blurry   blurry   can you stop      can you stop the bus  please  mate   thanks   so maybe that's why they were fighting     the day thomas drowned      well  i don't know  do i   i've worn you out  haven't i     i keep thinking      about      yeah   in your home   yeah   i keep thinking that if i close my eyes     right   my own daughter's next in line  is she  come on     go on  pet    come on   nothing's clean  is it   everybody's tainted   i'd hate to be you   i'd hate to be trapped in your skin   you're poison   i need that camera   you're hardly going to find it here  it's been months   it'll be halfway to denmark by now   it's our best link yet  lily marsh in those pictures   the two boys  luke and thomas  behind the lens   lily marsh and the older man out here  somewhere   al fresco    hi  joe  it's me  yeah  yeah  yeah  desk jockey   i'm just checking what we're looking for   black slr zoom lens  right   guess what i'm looking at   found 12 weeks back by a mr  j edwards in blyth  and it's been sat in lost property ever since   you trust me   don't you   is this the same model as thomas's   be careful with it   forensics want it back tip top     what's up with you    it's wednesday  isn't it   wednesday  the due date  for the baby   you know  i was there for michael  but i missed jessie   it's just nice to be around  be    you know   i tell you why it's blurry   at the end of the zoom   no matter how firm you hold it   the image starts to shake  right   so  if thomas was crouching here     let's have a little look     mum    she's off gallivanting   bye  gran   when you showed lily round   did you get the impression it was the first time she'd been there     how do you mean    did it seem familiar to her   how would that be possible   what do you do on friday afternoons     i beg your pardon    do you have a regular appointment   yes  i do  i teach art  hepworth library     what  what does it matter    i need your permission  to search the beach hut  i want everything cordoned off     the whole site    of course     but why    where's your husband now  mrs  calvert   at work  i don't know  he's  he's     left at the crack of dawn  and     why   why do you need to know   we think there's a small chance it's where lily marsh died   come in   it's probably nothing at all  but you did say     anything at all   can i just say   i feel so stupid  yelling at you like that   i had it coming   sometimes i just get lost in the chase   you should hear 'em at work   they think i was raised by wolves     here it is    don't touch it   sorry   seem to spend half my life wearing these   not very fetching  are they     when did it come    this morning  i think   just some silly prank   did you call laura on her mobile   it's switched off   but she got off to school all right   yes  well     i i think so  i     i erm   i only got back half an hour ago   you stayed the night at gary's   yes   and    does laura       take the school bus    aye   that's good  that's good   we'll just call  make doubly sure   i told you  her phone's switched off     no  the school  have you got the number    right  sorry   yeah  it's programmed on the phone   she's forgotten her inhaler   we've got another card   addressed to laura armstrong   and she's missing  joe  didn't turn up for school this morning   get yourself down there  talk to the school friends   if we're lucky  she may have taken herself off to the shops   and get calvert in for questioning   a 14 year old girl appears  to have been abducted this morning   our last circumstantial witness to the fact  that lily marsh and an older man  had sex in your beach hut  every friday afternoon  while your wife was away at her art club     this is insanity    so  this morning   i told you   i drove to the campus at eight  opened up the department   i'm a key holder  it's on the bloody roster   do you consider yourself an important man   a successful man  dr  calvert      what kind of a question       i googled you   height of impertinence  really   'made a notable contribution  'to british botanical studies in the '80s   'but more recent work  'is generally regarded as a consolidation '  now i'm guessing     that's bad  is it   the consolidation   three cheers for the early promise   but  oh  all those half empty lecture halls   bored skinny girls texting  their boyfriends     you gonna just sit there    was it standing room only   he was back in the day   remind you  my client is here of his own volition   and along comes lily   oh  i bet you were more than flattered     what nearly man wouldn't be    ok  we're done here   we'll be in touch   interview terminated 11 05   it's only her second day back at school   maybe the sight of all her friends all at once   maybe she couldn't face it   and thought  'i'll go for a walk'     you think that's possible    until we learn more   i think there's every chance   and when she gets back  she's gonna want you there on duty     no excuses    you are going to find her  aren't you   julie  you remember i showed you a photograph of a young woman     on sunday i showed you      yes  yes   well  we believe she was having a relationship  with a married man  an older man       and that your son  and tommy sharp witnessed them and took photographs   laura saw those photographs   now   we think     the boys approached this man     i'm sorry  it's a lot to take in   but if there's anything  anything at all  you know or you've heard     get somebody to give julie a lift home  will you   sure   don't you worry   'dirty bastard '  'dirty little bastard '  at thomas's memorial   down by the sea   yeah  aye  he was in a right mood   our laura turned round to him and said   'you can't talk about the dead like that '  but he said that he wasn't talking about thomas   he was talking about

armstrong were playing peacefully by the shore   'the deceased slipped and fell into the sea '  but they weren't playing peacefully  laura told me   they were having a fight   but why would the witness lie about it   quid pro quo   because the witness was a dirty bastard  who was willing to keep his mouth shut  so long as luke armstrong did the same for him   well  who was he  who was the eyewitness   get in the car   quiet   please  please  just let me go   laura   let her go   this one never saw you   she can't hurt you   luke will have told her   no   you were looking for a bird

him   her mouth     all over him   on her knees   disgusting at first  and then     clive   well  you were lonely   mam not there for you   it was mad  incredible   i   i did try to tell peter that i'd seen them   but  i mean        who's got the words for a thing like that   but you went back  didn't you   again and again  how long   weeks  months   i was just looking   but you weren't alone  were you   two lads with a camera   luke and thomas  they'd caught you spying   and now thomas had you on camera  didn't he   click click  peeping tom   dirty bastard   clive   clive  where are you

go out and finish her off   no  you didn't have to  clive worshipped you     please    he was besotted   well  who do you think he was watching every friday   clive had his own reasons for wishing to harm     yeah  luke armstrong  yes   but it was your girl trouble got him started   just a few words from an old friend in need   you turn murder into a noble cause  dr  calvert   first luke  and then lily marsh   wipe out the whole blessed memory   i hope you don't mind my asking  but     how did she take it     what    the wife   you and lily   she didn't seem all that surprised in the end   no
