who was she   rachel mcbain   she was the first mistress of the state   she became fascinated with the religion of the african servants   now days we call it woo do   locals thought she was a witch   then a young maid went visiting the house and her body was found in the lake     angel by miss hair    but i am a di king shining amond   when i was walking across the sports of today     and who do i see but the lovely troy     he's not my type    right   i keep doing things with my mind that  it's when i'm angry        or frighten  or even just upset   it's like an electric shock     she murdered her    i don't know if murder is the right word     sacrificed    she was trying to summon someone        or something    who is azazeal   he was the leader of the nephelin  they were angry to fell from heaven   you think you can do what you like with me        because you know how i feel about you   it wasn't an accident that you found the cannery   i'm weak cassie  i need to regain my strength   rachel sacrifice was a long time ago   that's the only way   sacrifice must be willing   must be a sacrifice in the true sense of the word    i'll take laager please     oh my god    jesus   it was an accident  i'm sorry     i'm covered in laager    i know  i'm sorry   really crap laager   i'm really sorry   don't worry  it happens all the time   let me buy you something proper and then off you go if you like   it's fine  thanks   ok   hi cassie   hi   i thought it was really interesting what you said in media today   yeah   i watched alien again the other day     great film    really great film   i was really questioning about any of the alien films as a cult glancer  aren t they   oh    i don't know   well    did you know that in alien's sckully weeper's mother play ripley s daughter     really    yeah and i noticed that latter   i've got this theory  right   and not one you should say so to anyone  but you  you'll understand  alien is a microcosm for the world   we know  it's like the monster within   and we've all got one   we're psychopaths  the murderer is     there it might look normal  but what you can't see        what's inside wrong   philip  you're a genius   you're aliens   are you right   oh god   she's still got pepper slapped up     gem    yeah  isn't it bloody miserable   takes not but vodka   takes a lot to do that   nooo   you're stuck with me  what do you want   work for me  what you normally do  open your mind   run  run   would you stop that   that's not what you said a moment ago   i'm living in fear  now i'm sleeping in fear  and i hate furry knickers   but you love the rest     i look like a whore    i know you look great   a bit too much lip gloss maybe  but the giggling was cute   you missed breakfast   i think the goon has got rush   he's been eating a lot of natural yogurt recently   haven't you got anything better to do with your time   no  really no  i was thinking about joining a bit of chat        i went to the bar  there are no much cool reasons that ghosts dwell   have you been stalked by any foreign angels recently   i seem to attract them   what did he want this time   oh neither  couple of drinks  a few chasing evils  loot a human soul     just another friday night  didn't it   getting that way   i'd give anything smooth things normal again     i know    i think he's trying to drive me down   peel you into submission   he thinks somebody can vent at him   i thought that too but you never did   why is this happening to me  thelma   azazeal said it was no accident you found the canary     cannery    yeah  that     but what does that mean    i don't know   but he is a man and they never make sense   maybe is best not to know   i had enough   where are you going  is media     i'm not going    skidder   you don't know anything about cars  do you   i just have been here half an hour and i'm getting a bit desperate   not really   i'll have to call the mechanic     have you got the choke out    yeah  i did so   then you probably flooded the engine   right  is that serious   leave it fifteen minutes and should be fine   cool  thanks   so  i was thinking if i give you a lift you might not turn you into a crapper around cars   i'm all right thanks   come on i know it looks like a piece of shit  but the alloy is in you   i'm fine walking   heated seats  front and rear speakers  climate control     troy  is a fiesta   so you are getting in or no   how come that you escaped media   so did you   leon is driving me nuts   you know he talks in sleep   ok  but that's a whole other story  anyway   last week he started singing in sleep   he's a fatuous  i swear  at first i thought he was taking the piss   i mean this is mixed up mess    kyle and eminem coming out of his mouth      so  chalking step down he's definitely sleep   i thought he was your best mate   no  is lydia   oh  i mean yeah we're mates but is so ambiguous that we disagree   sorry  i shouldn't be doing the whole room mate mum  not under the circumstances   it's alright   tell me  it's the partners thing   some times you have to step up   strange  isn't it   people are making it very strange   you got to rule them out like they were silent   never is like to have a love but yes i got an awful lot of concern  tackle her over   you know  they    they want to dedicate a bench to her   and they asked me where i think the spot was i mean        what am i supposed to say to that   ghost change the mood   exactly   you must miss her   i can't help the feeling that she's    still there   you know  watching over me   does it help   sort of   how much did that thing cost you   hey  you insult my car  you insult me   alright  let's move along  it's ok   oh    how sweet   how nice to see you  mr both in class   oh

bus but i would have missed my appointment     next time come and see me first ok    will do   thanks   no worries   cassie   if you have a    need some company i'm always happy to get away from leon   and i promise i won't be nice to you     mmmm  can i borrow these    you must   i'm suffering from sensory deprivation     maybe you have been up and go too long    eh     coffee shop    ooh   ooh  i was just in the area     well i was worried about you    yeah  right   it's true  there is a soul eating demon in the loose and you're taking tea     i was just concerned    is that right   yes   you weren't spying on me   spying is such a dirty word   thelma don't try to step out of end  don't do it again   ooh    this   did you just listened to anything i just said   and    tell me young lady when exactly where you planning to use that   well  ripped for her pleasure     well that works   how do you know   thelma bates i didn't know you had it in you   yeah  well you've got to try everything once   run   that was so no funny   i mean  we were having a nice conversation     and suddenly a freak girl pops out of nowhere   talk about a manicure  was she possessed     i don't know   i've always been suspicious of little girls in wad dresses   i haven't seen you in such state   yeah  well  ghosts get scared too   i've decided that we need to know what is going on   no  absolutely not     it's worth a try    you don't have to do it   come on  it can't be that bad   trust you can handle an electric fence   i did that once   whilst you were seen from the shiny   to some people that would be very exciting   oh  you know you have to   it's just a question of when and whilst i've got and eternity to wait  you     all right  all right  i'll do it     god girl    excuse me   or something less patronizing     you want me to throw you to the nail  girl    no miss  sorry miss     don't make do that again    what  what did you see     there was this girl    the same girl     i don't know  she had long hair    what was she doing   she was dead thelma  she was hanging from a tree   don't do that  it's like living with a dirty old man   you should be grateful i can't warp you   believe me i am   it never happen to be like that  it's so scarily weird     i woke up being dead    not david terron again   no   it was all    girl on girl   it's not funny   i just    wonder if we had sex  i mean    we did it everywhere   we were on for anything    and you know what the worst thing was   i wasn't really enjoying it   actually no  that's not the worst thing     i don't even think i can tell you this    what     the girl      go on   it was thelma   well    have you any idea how frustrating it is being a lesbian ghost   thelma  that's gross  she's dead     well  obviously she wants more     now  that would be interesting   i think you killed the moment   what are you so afraid of   look at you  you are a mess   what do you want   you are not being very friendly  are you   what did you expect   ah yes    poor thelma   i didn't want to do that but     there you go  sometimes trivial things get in the way   there's nothing more natural than death  cassie   we're all born for it   even you   you could go like this for ever   but it seems a shame to prolong the inevitable  don't you think   that depends  i like to think you make your own destiny   something tells me you won't be thinking that for long   what's that supposed to mean   don't expend your energy fighting me cassie  you cannot win   tell me what's going on   you have to figure that out for yourself   it's the girl     the girl    you know what i mean   history has a habit of repeating itself   why are you so repulsed by me   because you saw what i truly am   you judge me so harshly   that won't always be so   we're the same  you and i   if you could see your soul    even now   do you think her and thelma affair do   oh    that's a horrible thought     i reckon they did    really   yeah but they won't getting at anywhere else  will they   that's very true   so  eh    who so you think was the man   leon  are you really liking to talk about thelma     i think they uh    took it in turns    really   and would you too do that for me or     oh  you always take it too further leon   oh  off he bumps     hey  how are you doing   sorry  i've got no concern   fine  i would  at least till now   i wondered if you wanted to go for a drink   what   i mean not tonight but you know  on friday or something   is that ok   well i don't know is    why     i thought we had a laugh the other day    we did   it's just things are a bit awkward at the moment     ok  some other time    yeah   when suits you best   i don't know   right  well i just thought i'd ask     it's kind of hard to explain    no  it's ok  no problem   i wonder what he meant   history has a habit of repeating itself   i don't know  and i don't want to think about it     i thinks he enjoys winding you up    clearly  men  aren't they all arrogant pathetic pigs   women run the world  men just shit in it   you're the most dramatic ghost i have ever known     cassie    what   you never watched me playing apple   you're crap   history has a habit of repeating itself   hey  cassie  how are you doing   apart from two hours in the russian revolution  fine     i was worried about you the other day    really   yeah  it's not like you to bump school   look  i've said sorry  would you mind if you ok me   i'm a bit concerned  that's all   you and everyone else  i'm fine   you've had such a hard time as of lately     i know but  please  just treat me as normal   i'm worried you're shutting everyone out   because you're not listening     maybe you should cry more  try it with self mutilation    shut it   i like joe but  sometimes he's just too nice   if i tell you something  you promise not to spread it   he writes erotic fiction in his spare time   you're kidding     why would he do that    oh  how for  how that  it's not very good     really    got not action   what   what are we looking for   i don't know   thelma  help me with this   what is it   esther mcbain  i think she's the girl i keep seen     remember i told you about rachel    yeah       so  esther must be      rachel mcbain daughter  cassie   i can't believe what they did to that little girl   why do you think they locked her in there   i've no idea   maybe she went mad   i got the feeling   do you think it has anything to do with what he said   about what   history repeating itself   probably  really   look i got another things to chew on than never think about it   witch   do you know what is considered to be the world's first convenience food   if i guess right can we talk about cassie   the hamburg sausage  who'd have thought of that   i don't think she's dealing with thelma's death very well   i'd be more concerned if she was   i think she blames herself   have you spoken to her   how can i have  just plants up   maybe you're loosing your touch  no longer the one with the kids   i got her bumping schooling today  that's not like her at all   what  did you never skipped a lesson   well  yes   did it turn you into a serial killer   i just think she needs a bit of support     not like her mother is any help    ah  yes   she's still at brook gate   she's still undergoing treatment  yes   what about her dad   persona non grata  i don't think cassie even remembers him   do you know that there are actual quotes in the odyssey about sausages   i just think that you and cassie have a special bond   that's may be   but i think there is only one thing that can solve this and that's time   and she has got a lot more of that that we have   would you talk to her   yes miss watkins  anything you say   anything   don't tempt me   a sudden blow    the great wings beating still about the staggering girl  her thighs caressed by the dark webs  her nape caught in his bell  he holds her helpless breast upon his breast  how can those terrified vague fingers  push the feathered glory form her listening thighs  and how can body lying in that white rush  but feel the strange heart beating where it lies   for those of you who don't remember     this poem describes zeus in the form of a swam raping leda  does anyone have any thoughts   no we would like a bit of animal now and then      you not may find it surprising that many people   women in particular  find the poem offensive     they think that yates is getting off on it    exactly   well  you can't blame them for that   others thing that he's writing about one of the most enduring of human myths  beauty and the beast   so  for the assignment next week  i want you to thing about which side of the fence you're on     i'm all beast    thank you leon   you bet   beast     see you around    yeah  give me a call     hi    hi   you're going to listen your thighs  cassie   no   sorry  he's such a taunt     hum  i know is a bit of a long shot but that drink you were talking about the other day     i'm around if you are   is that an invitation then   all right  you're on   are you ever going to stop eating   no   i'm going to have whatever i want and never put on a pound   shame i wasn't a bit skinnier when i died  really   you know  i don't think i'm exploiting this ghost thing enough   i can perform a naked hardcore in the headmaster office and no one would know   it is that something that you've always wanted to do   i think i'll walk into appreciate it much more   see  i can still make you smile     that was a grimace    what are you up to later   actually i am    i'm going on a date   right   that's nice   golden bows  i presume   i'm joking   what are you looking     it's very nice    not too much   look  i know this is weird for you     with all the other shit that's going on at the moment i just want to have a god time   yeah  i know  i'm sure you will   thelma    i     wish me luck   you don't need it   cassie  look after yourself  won't you     hi    hi   i brought the jumpings  just in case
