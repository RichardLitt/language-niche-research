funny  but i'm guessing you drew the short straw   bad luck   therewasfour of us   i'm talking about getting laid  so how are we going to do this  man   do what   divide them up  because the one with all the frizzy hair   i don't see me and her getting it on   because she's beautiful   no  because she'd be way too much effort   she looks high maintenance   you'd have to treat her really well  pff   but that other one   kelly   whatever  a couple of bacardi breezers  man   i reckon she'd be good to go   i might need more than a couple myself  but who's counting   yeah  and the girls like  do

you couldn't see me   all right   go on  then  do it   turn invisible   oh  my god  he's disappeared   can't you see me   can't you see me  no   you're invisible   you two are hilarious   really  keep taking that medication   don't go out there  he will kill you   of course he will because he's such a bad ass   of course he will because he's such a bad ass  don't   'i would  i would definitely shag her '  come on  this is the biggest load of bullshit i've ever heard   no   no  ah   argh   can't you see me     no     you're invisible    you two are hilarious  really  keep taking that medication   don't  don't go out there  he will kill you   of course he will because he's such a bad ass   of course he will because he's such a bad ass  don't   of course he will because he's such a bad ass  don't  she's telling the truth   and you know this how  i suppose you're a psychic now too   all this  it's already happened once   i open the door  the probation worker  he killed you   you were right there   you were dead  everything froze   you were all just standing there  time went backwards   what are you saying  what  you turned back time   it just gets better by the second   it just gets better by the second  everything happened again  exactly the same   i'm telling you  don't open that door   no   he's right   the probation worker's gone mental   maybe he's on crystal meth  that stuff makes you crazy   my friend chloe did it  she nearly shagged her brother   and he's really ugly   the graffiti  i'm going to kill you  he wrote it   what did i say   i said there was a hidden meaning   or not   did anything happen to you   no  we should call the police   he took our phones  he's got all our phones   he's stopped   you dickhead  why did you come back here  you should have gone for help   what do you know  bitch   what do you know  bitch  shut up  you chav   if you call me a chav one more time  i'll kick you so hard in the cunt your mum will feel it   her mum will feel

you can all fuck off   whatever  i'm getting out of here   whatever  i'm getting out of here  out the back way  come on   fuck's sake   is that blood   fuck  jesus christ   get it off me   jesus   i did wonder what had happened to him   he's going to kill us   turn back time  stop this happening   i don't know how it works   that's great  that's really useful   come on   don't look at him   i've got to have sex with you right now   you're so beautiful   what's up with him   let's go  let's do it now   let's go  let's do it now  get off me  you freak   what   you're so hot  i'm gonna bone you  i'm gonna shag you senseless   what did i do   you said you were going to shag her   you said you were going to shag her  you were getting your chap out   you said you were going to shag her  you were getting your chap out  shut up   it's when you were touching her   i'm so hard for you   i want to rip your clothes off and piss on your tits   what is happening to me   you sick bastard   what did you do   is he dead   i'm no doctor but     you see the way the back of his head's caved in like that     i'm not a chav   that should do it   you killed our operation worker   this is very  very bad   i feel sick   he would have killed us   we should call the police   it was self defence   yeah  he's right  we show him the dead boy  in the locker  they'll do some csi shit and figure it out   they won't believe us   we just tell them the truth  we stick to our story   what's our story  they can turn invisible  and that you can turn back time   it doesn't matter what we tell them  they'll say we're lying   they'll say we killed them both   no one's gonna believe you  not any more   if there's no body  there's no crime   we should bury them under the flyover   yeah   how do we do that  someone's gonna see us   no  we give them a quick little     put them in those wheelchairs  wheel them up there   and if anyone sees us  we're just a bunch of young offenders  taking a couple of specials for a walk in the sunshine   i'm pretty sure this breaches the terms of my asbo   we don't tell anyone about this  yeah   about the storm or what it did to us or anything   we are about to bury our probation worker   we don't need to be drawing any attention to ourselves   i don't want anyone to know   i cannot be a freak   what about you   there's no going back now  man   you were just as screwed as the rest of us   you are black and famous  you are probably more screwed   i shouldn't even be here   just then  when he was touching yer     how were you doing that   i don't know   didn't you say you wanted to piss on her tits   probably best to keep that kind of thing  between you and your internet service provider   are you all right   'if she can hear what i'm thinking   'does she know i want to shag her   'shit  she can hear that '  hold on  all of you have some kind of special power   everyone can do something except me   he can do something  he can do something and i can't   that's ridiculous  look at him   how does that make any sense   maybe you can do something  you just haven't found out what it is yet   yeah  right   what if i can't feel pain  ow   did you feel that   stop hitting me     god knows your lonely souls    god knows your lonely souls    god knows your lonely souls    i believe there's a time and a place    to let your mind drift and get out of this place    i believe there's a day and a place    that we will go to and i know you want to share    there's no secret to living    just keep on walking    there's no secret to dying    just keep on flying    i'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name    i'm gonna die in a space    that don't hold my name       if anyone asks what happened yesterday  we say nothing  right   it's just a completely normal day   there's nothing here   no note  nothing  it's like he's just disappeared   some of them are here already   yeah   i'll talk to them   gary and my colleague  tony  have both been reported missing   their families are very worried about them   have you seen anything unusual  anything at all   you saw something   a few days ago     i go into the toilets  tony and gary were in there   they are butt naked  tony has very by his hair   like this  and he's just doing him  doggy style   and tony is like   who's your daddy  i'm your daddy  i'm big daddy   you like that   oh  yeah  oh  yeah   i'm daddy cool   so i'm guessing they've ran away to continue their illicit homosexual affair   i ask you  in this world of intolerance and prejudice   who are we to condemn them   hi  this is tony  leave me a message and i'll get back to you  as soon as i can   bye   i think we got away with it   do you actually believe that or are you just really dumb   i actually believe that   i was there  i should have one of these bullshit powers   you can have mine  you want to hear what people are thinking about you   not so much  i want something good  something from the a list   maybe you can fly   he's not going to be able to fly   yeah  there's always someone that can fly  check it out   don't   ow  no  that's not it   so what happens now  is this it  are we gonna be like this forever   what if we are meant to be  like  superheroes   you lot  superheroes   no offence  but in what kind of fucked up world  would that be allowed to happen   i did not sign up for that   superheroes  i love this guy   you prick   what if there's loads of people like us all over town   no  that kind of thing only happens in america   this will fade away  i'm telling you  by this time next week   it'll be back to the same old boring shit   you   you want to tell us who that was   there is something weird going on with jeremy   can you get me a gun   there's no way i'm getting a dickhead like you a gun   my mum told me to stay away from girls like you   your mum has never met a girl like me   let's do it on the desk   get off me   let's get that wind flowing through your scalp  come on   someone knows  they know we killed our probation worker
