comrades  and watched your comrades fall  raise your hands   the blood shed on flanders fields   the sweat of your brows   who reaps the rewards   no   no     who  then  do they stand among us    no

fucking cut in your wages   that is your reward   raise a hand  all those who want to strike   yeah   on the house  mr shelby   i'll take a mild  right   cheers  thomas   good health to you   the crown of a prince   soon to be king  i'd bet  you don't bet   no  but these past few days i've been speculating   about what   one of my union comrades has a sister   works in the telegraph office at the bsa factory   she says over the past week they've had messages  coming up from london to the brass   from winston churchill himself   something about a robbery    a robbery of national significance   it said   she found the list of names left on the telegraph machine   and on that list was your name and my name together   what kind of a list would have the name of a communist and the name of a bookmaker side by side   perhaps it's a list of men who give false hope to the poor   the only difference between you and me  freddie   is that sometimes     my horses stand a chance of winning   you know  there are days when i hear about the cuttings  and beatings that i really wish i'd let you take that bullet in france   believe me  there are nights i wish you had   they're going to get me  on three  one  two  three  down   breathe  danny  breathe   they're going to kill me   danny   danny  danny  you're home  we're all home in england   you're not in france   you're not an artillery shell  danny  you're a man  eh   you're not a whizz bang  you're a human being  danny   you're all right  you're all right  you're all right   up  up   it's all right  it's all right   oh

all that smoke and mud out of your head  eh   yes  mr shelby  i'm sorry   go on   mr shelby  you have to do something about him   damn right  harry   you pay the peaky blinders a lot of money for protection   you're the law around here now  tommy  aren't you   maybe you should put a bullet in danny whizz bang's head like they do with mad horses   maybe you'll have to put a bullet in my head someday  too   bring the bill to the peaky blinders  we'll take care of this   look at the gun   recognise it   oof   get up off your arse  you mumping pig   aunt pol  what the fuck d'you do that for    finn was playing with this this afternoon by the cut  it was loaded   he nearly blew ada's tits off   it must've fell out of my pocket   he said he found it on the sideboard of the betting shop    with bullets in it   ma    i must've been drunk   when are you not drunk   look  aunt pol  i'm sorry   i'm    i'm sorry   we'll keep this between ourselves  if you swear not to leave guns lying around   look  i know having four kids without a woman is hard   but my boot's harder  now  come on  we're late   'right   'i've called this family meeting because i've got some very important news '  scudboat and lovelock got back from belfast last night   they were buying a stallion to cover their mares   they were in a pub on the shankhill road yesterday   and in that pub  there was a copper     handing out these    if you're over five feet and can fight  come to birmingham    they're recruiting protestant irishmen to come over here as specials   to do what  to clean up the city  ada   he's a chief inspector   the last four years  he's been clearing the ira out of belfast   how do you know so bloody much   cos i asked the coppers on our payroll   and why didn't you tell me   i'm telling you   so why are they sending him to birmingham   well  there's been all these bloody strikes at the bsa     and the austin works lately   now the papers are talking about sedition   and revolution   i reckon it's communists he's after   so this copper's going to leave us alone  right   there are irishmen in green lanes who left belfast to get away from him   they say catholic men who crossed him used to disappear in the night   yeah  but we ain't ira  we bloody fought for the king   anyway  we're peaky blinders  we're not scared of coppers   he's right  if they come for us  we'll cut them a smile each   so  arthur     is that it  what do you think  aunt pol   this family does everything open   you've nothing more to say to this meeting  thomas   no   nothing that's women's business   this whole bloody enterprise was women's business while you boys were away at war   what's changed   we came back   and the lord will smite the unholy when the great judgment comes   and judgment is coming  my friends   judgment is coming to this wicked city   and your wickedness and your fornication will be revealed   you cannot hide from the creator   you cannot hide from the almighty himself  the creator sees all   you cannot hide from the true and living god     get off with yer   fuck off   that's it  i don't go any further   i have ten minutes  what do you want   an explanation   i've always been able to tell when you're hiding something   people round here talk   some of them work at the bsa   i've been talking to the wives of factory hands   detectives have been asking questions in the proofing shops   nothing happens in that factory without you knowing about it   speak   god and aunt polly are listening   it was meant to be routine   i had a buyer in london for some    motorcycles   i asked my men to steal me four bikes with petrol engines   i'm guessing my men were drunk   there's a still inside the factory makes tram line gin   they picked up the wrong fucking crate   the boys dropped it at charlie strong's yard as agreed   they must've taken it from the proofing bay  instead of the export bay   holy sweet baby of mary   inside we found 25 lewis machine guns     jesus  tommy   all bound for libya   sitting right there in charlie strong's yard   tell me you threw them in the cut   we put 'em in the stables  out of the rain   the guns hadn't been greased yet   so that's why they sent a copper from belfast   maybe  maybe not   thomas  you're a bookmaker  a robber  a fighting man   you're not a fool   you sell those guns to anyone who has use to 'em  you will hang   dump them somewhere the police can find them   maybe if they know they haven't fallen into the wrong hands  this might blow over   tell charlie to dump them tonight   no  he won't move contraband under a full moon   three days until it wanes   then you'll do the right thing   you have your mother's common sense  but your father's devilment   i see them fighting   let your mother win   i got tickets for the penny crush  they're showing a tom mix picture   i'm not in the mood for the pictures tonight  ada   well  i'm not doing it here again  i got covered in mud last time   let's just walk a bit   if we go down as far as greet  we could go to a pub   your brothers have friends in greet   they have friends everywhere  we'd have to walk to london   i'm with you because you're the only man round here not scared of them   oh  i'm scared of them all right   but you love me more than you fear them  right   i don't want to be always sneaking about   soon  we'll tell them  when   how did the family meeting go   usual  there's a new copper coming  i heard   hmm  and tommy says he's after the likes of you   so maybe you should burn your books and stop making speeches   oh  my ada   the only princess of the royal family of the kingdom of small heath   i'm just a poor communist frog with a big mouth   give me a kiss  princess ada  she laughs  i'm here about

ireland are you from   galway  ah   i worked in dublin   me mother was from galway   you're too pretty   watch   and listen       i wish i was in carrickfergus      only for nights in ballygrand      i would swim over the deepest ocean      the deepest ocean my love to find      my boyhood friends and my own relations      have all passed on now like the melting snow       in ireland my singing made them cry and stopped them fighting   well  i hope you know a lot of songs   babies     discarded    with the fish bones and eggshells   girls  11 years old     pierced and punctured by old men for thruppence a time   rutted upon like animals   degradation   fathers with their daughters  brothers and sisters sharing beds   beggars and thieves left to run in the streets   and astride the whole stinking pile of wounds and rotten flesh     your masters   the men who you touch your cap to   the peaky blinders   the vicious    merciless gangs  who blind those that see and cut out the tongues of those who talk   you are worse than them   those of you who have taken their bribes these years since the war   those of you who look the other way  you    are worse than them   god damn you for soiling your uniforms   and then    there are the ira fenians and the communists   blacker hearts still   they feed on the puss of all this corruption like maggots in a corpse   and like maggots  if left to swell they will eventually swarm like flies  and spread their rotten philosophy across the country and across the world   those then    are our enemies   a three headed beast   it is my job to decapitate each one and by god i will do it   i don't trust any of yous until you earn my trust   and that takes some earning   these are the new men who will bolster your ranks   good men     from god fearing families   by the time the sun sets  they will be sworn in and in uniform   and by sunrise tomorrow  they will be on the streets   god help those who stand in our way   sorry

there      waving his handkerchief      as merry as a robin that sings on the tree       we haven't had singing in here since the war   why do you think that is  harry   so did arthur say what kind of deal this new copper offered him   god  the second your balls are empty it's back onto politics   what did tommy say   he didn't say anything  you know what he's like   yeah  i know what he's like   he likes to take his fights onto the mud   doesn't like to stand and wait   you know what he'd do if he found out about us   he could try   sometimes  it's like you're with me just to show you can   one day me and tommy will be on the same side again   tommy     aargh   hey  what you do  we're closed  go home   go home  crazy man   i said go home  crazy man   i said go home   fix bayonets     secretary of state  this is chief inspector campbell   mr churchill  sir  may i say what a great honour it is to meet you   bit of a whistle stop tour   love the hat  by the way  thank you  it's beaver   so  how are you settling in   i have set up a command network   i have agents in place across the city  who will act as my eyes and ears   and i have begun to interrogate suspects vigorously   you were in belfast  i understand you broke a few fenian hearts   a rat's nest  sir   so who do you think stole the guns  fenians or communists   if it is ira fenians  i will find them and find the guns   if it is communists  i will find them and find the guns   if it is common criminals  i will find them and find the guns   to me there are no distinction between any of the above   we chose you because you are effective   but remember this  mr campbell  this is england  not belfast   bodies thrown in the rivers  wash up in the papers here   we must keep the existence of these stolen guns out of the news  otherwise we will simply be advertising them for sale   if there are bodies to be buried  dig holes and dig them deep   i want everything accounted for down to the last bullet   uncle charlie  a word   they are aboard  there's no moon   we can take them out to the turning point beyond gas street  and leave them on the bank   they'll be found by railway men first thing   is that agreement   i changed my mind   you what   i have an alternative strategy   tell curly to take her out to the old tobacco wharf   there's a lock up mooring we used to keep cigarettes   he knows it   when the boat leaves your yard  it's no longer your concern   have you lost your fucking mind   have you not seen the streets   they've sent a fucking army to find these things     that's right  they've shown their hand     their hand   if they want them back this bad  they'll have to pay   that's the way of the world   fortune drops something valuable in your lap   you don't just dump it on the bank of the cut   you're blood  tommy   i've always looked out for you like a dad   you're going to bring holy hell down on your head   this copper takes no prisoners   i'm told he didn't serve   reserved occupation   is it another war you're looking for  tommy   the tobacco wharf   by order of the peaky blinders   are you in position   i am  sir   your first impressions   i am quite shocked at how these people live   have you found anything out that might help me   i interrogated the head of the peaky blinders  he didn't know anything   a brute   it strikes me that it isn't arthur who heads the shelby family   it is the younger one  thomas   they say he won two medals for gallantry in the war   you sound fascinated   however  my opinion has not changed   the bookmaker gangs have other business  and the communists are too weak to have planned this   i believe the guns were taken by the ira   you must not let your personal history cloud your judgment   what history   that the ira murdered my father will not affect my judgment   if you see any guns  check the serial numbers against that list   your father was the finest officer i ever worked with   i know he would be very  very proud of you   danny  as you know  the man you killed was italian   and those two men over there are his brothers   if i let the italians do this  danny   they'll cut off your manhood and let you drain   that's how those bastards do things   so  to stop a war breaking out between us and the italians     and to save you from their barbarity     i said i would dispatch you myself   they are here to witness   i died over there anyway  tommy   i left my fucking brains in the mud   you have any last requests  comrade   you'll look out for my rosie and my boys   see they get apprenticeships  at the bsa factory or the austin   they'll make foremen  i know they will   just ordinary     just ordinary men   and they won't get told to do this shit     this shit    this shit that we got told to do   i suppose i ought to pray now   those fucking guns blew god right out of my head   is that boat for me   we have to get your body out of the city  danny   this new copper  you know     don't bury me anywhere where there's mud  ok   promise me   bury me on a hill and tell rosie where   you were a good man and a good soldier   yes  sergeant major   in the bleak midwinter   gunshot  where are you   it bloody won   monaghan boy bloody won   yeah  it won   and word will spread   so next time we do the powder trick it won't just be the garrison  that'll bet on the horse  it'll be the whole of small heath   and you know what  the horse will win again   and the third time we do it  we'll have the whole of birmingham betting on it   a thousand quid bet on the magic horse   and that time  when we are ready  the horse will lose   think about it   you ok  danny   i'm still in shock   you sure this isn't heaven   if it was heaven  what would i be doing here   tommy wanted you to think it was real  to try and knock some sense into you   a shell full of sheep brains hurts pretty bad   it was meant to   so where are you taking me  london   tommy has a little job for you  give you chance to say thanks   you're a peaky blinder now  danny   a bad week   there was no moon last night  i checked   did you do the right thing   yes  i did the right thing
