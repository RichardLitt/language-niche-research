 man  maybe you're on holiday   maybe you're on a business trip   maybe you missed the last train or the last flight   thanks   maybe you're getting married   maybe you had a row with your wife or husband and they kicked you out   chances are you might end up somewhere like this   just sign there     863  for two nights   sir  the bill is fully itemised   room charge  restaurant  bar  telephone  dry cleaning   how can you justify charging these prices  this is extortion   okay  it's gonna cost you an arm and a leg   and if this is your first visit  it may come as a bit of a shock   but what are you gonna get for your money   the best view   the best service   the finest ingredients   the utmost discretion   but that's not the whole picture  what you're really paying for is the opportunity  to live out your wildest  darkest  craziest fantasies   to be  for maybe just a night or two  the person you really want to be   i'm not paying it   mr austin  glad i caught you  mrs austin left some personal items in the room   perhaps on your next visit  mrs austin can enjoy some complimentary sessions  in our health and beauty spa   whatever or whoever you want to be     thank you      we'll look after you   what would you say your responsibilities would be if i gave you the job   i'd say my number one responsibility as deputy manager would be to the guests   to ensure they have an enjoyable and relaxing stay   my job is to serve them  no matter how absurd  bizarre or perverse their requirements may be     oh  god  sorry  do you mind   i think i have all the necessary skills  i'm organised  ambitious   and i just think the job will be more personally rewarding than working on reception    you said  think  twice   is that a bad thing   try using  believe   as in   i believe your account is overdue  mrs akiko    puts a more positive spin on things   let me see  did we find the finger  okay  get him to a hospital     you have all the attributes of a good receptionist  you're polite  handsome  flirtatious   and yet strangely asexual   thank you   so why would i want to lose my best receptionist and gain an inexperienced deputy manager   come on  out  the honesty bar is for guests  not for the homeless   every bloody morning he's here  maybe i put some ice down his back  eh   i'll handle this  thank you  gino   darling  it's gone 9 00  time to go to work   dinner will be on the table when you get home   come on  out   imagine your worst day  a day when everything goes wrong  and everyone blames you  then multiply that by 10   that is an average day in the life of a hotel manager   doesn't put me off  i want to progress   one day i want your job  in another five star hotel  obviously   don't tell me  it's always been your boyhood dream   well  no  what kid grows up dreaming about running a hotel    i did  what's in the box  tony   mr kendal  302  requested female company   i offered him a female escort  he asked for something a little bit different   if you'll excuse me  i have to go and source a foot pump   any questions   just one  if a job in management is as bad as you say it is  then why do you do it   i never said the job was bad  i said it was long hours and hard work    there are also a lot of perks   like   like  if you ever get the job  you'll discover for yourself   my last three deputies all quit within six months   none of them were tough enough to stand up to me  are you   i    i believe so   good interview  charlie  i'll be making my decision after the weekend   the saudi gentleman  sheik      sheik ahmed bin marmet   he's been waiting around all morning  wanted to thank you personally for your understanding   the question you've got to ask yourself is   is the job really worth all the arse kissing that goes with it   it's the best job in the world  it is   you get rich  beautiful guests making passes at you   you're surrounded by the best of everything  and on top of that  the tips are great    yeah  the tips are good   and for a manager  they're excellent    mr    mr geffen   texas geffen   came here a couple of weeks ago   he lent rebecca the keys to his villa in barbados as a thank you   well  if she wants someone to carry her bags     the real reason why i want this job so badly   one day  i want to be able to come into a place like this  as a guest   rent the biggest suite  order anything day in and day out   and money just not be an object    never gonna happen   exactly   so surely  the next best thing is being in charge of a place like this   and if i have to kiss a little bit of arse  then   i'll happily pucker up    do you think she'll give you the job   no idea   don't suppose it'll improve your chances  if you're three minutes late for her morning meeting   oh  shit  you coming   no  i'm not the one looking for a promotion  sunshine   pucker up    sorry i'm late  rebecca   don't make a habit of it  charlie    anything juicy in last night's log   relatively quiet night  until mrs salcombe in room 706 opened her mini bar and discovered this   a chocolate bar   open it and see  you can imagine her disappointment   good god  this must have taken someone hours    sorry i'm late  rebecca   don't worry about it  tony    how much do we charge for this bar    1   arrange for a complimentary basket of chocolates  to be sent up to mrs salcombe with our apologies   then find out who occupied room 706 before her   are we sure this was not done by a chambermaid    they eat all bloody day   my girls don't steal   why is a guest perfectly happy shelling out  200 a night for a room   but they won't pay for a bar of chocolate   well  their expenses don't cover the mini bar  they can't claim it back    oh  please   okay  listen up   the duty manager at the burlington has been on the phone  wants to know   if we can accommodate the junk dogs   the what   they're not a what  they're a who  the junk dogs are an american rock outfit   three nights into a five night gig at wembley arena    what do we know about them   bass player is a convicted arsonist   burnt down the aristotle in denver a couple of years ago    heavy drinkers   rock and rollers  gino    they'll clear your bar out in about two hours   jackie  sound like trouble   i'm expecting a 1796 napoleon cognac in today  i can sell it for  600 a shot   mark it up as 750  i'll get back to the burlington  tell them we'd be delighted to welcome the      junk dogs   the junk dogs  rock and roll  everybody   excuse me  rebecca  it's only a small point   but we're already booked 120   we currently don't have any room for them   i'm sure we can squeeze them in somewhere  can't we  charlie   charlie  rockstars love hotels  and we love having them to stay   parties in the suite  round the clock room service   champagne jacuzzis  groupies by the bus load   the rich  the famous and the notorious  they are our lifeline   and we never  ever turn them away   apologies for the inconvenience  ladies and gentlemen   but due to an electrical fault  we have to clear the floor   we do  of course  only have your safety and comfort in mind   reception will be happy to give you new rooms or alternative accommodation at a nearby hotel    how are we doing   just clearing the floor now   find jackie  get housekeeping to sweep through   why do they need the entire floor to themselves   security reasons  all celebrities are cowards   oh  charlie  i'll be giving your page and mobile numbers to the band   anything they want  any time of day  they can call you    me   you want to progress to management    here's an opportunity to prove yourself   you can count on me  rebecca   build up a rapport with them  make them feel comfortable  relaxed and special    get them into the bar as soon as they arrive   exactly   oh  i do hope they refrain from urinating  i hate it when guests urinate on our property     oh  hi   we're just emptying the 7th floor  you got any chambermaids free   i'll see what i can do   was there anything else you wanted from me   we've got a problem with 706   right   man  oh  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah     i got reception to phone the room  but there was no answer     man  wait a minute  wait  wait  wait  wait    can't we just let ourselves in   that is the biggest no no of the job   you never  under any circumstances  let yourself into an occupied room    right  guest's privacy   actually  no  it's for your own safety   so how are we gonna get them out   morning  men  can i interest you in a lovely piece of fine cheese     this never happened   yeah   so how long do we wait     man  what the       that didn't sound very good   this is a thoroughly regrettable incident   and we will  of course  take care of your expenses at the chesterton   and please allow us to provide you with a limousine service to the airport tomorrow   begin your honeymoon in style with our compliments   apologies for the disruption  madam   but we have found you accommodation at another hotel in the area    i'm just preparing your final bill now   preparing the bill for you now      charlie  can i take a break soon   we're kind of busy   i know  but i want to freshen up before the band get here   ben  these are hard drinking american rock stars  they're not gonna fall in love with you   sometimes you can be so cruel   it's for tonight  if that's not too much of an imposition   i'll look into that for you  sir  of course   have you noticed anything odd about rebecca today    no   it's friday    and she's wearing the black armani two piece   so   the black armani two piece she wears on thursdays   it's the same suit that she wore yesterday   i thought you had to be gay to notice things like that   no  observation is 90  of the concierge's job   when a woman like rebecca wears the same clothes two days running   something isn't right   i want a receipt   thank you    i'd like to check in   certainly  madam  the name   the junk dogs   ah  we've been looking forward to your arrival  will the musicians be checking in themselves   they're doing a sound check  i'll take care of the paperwork   okay  all right  just need a couple of signatures here and here   can i just say  madam  that it's an honour to have the junk dogs stay here   i am an enormous fan of their music   i'll pass that message on to them  they'll be thrilled   they've been working very hard to reach the gay black demographic   it is good to see their efforts haven't been in vain   it's just like flushing a toilet on an aeroplane   vacuum drainage system  good for the guests  good for the environment   ah  this very powerful shower can comfortably accommodate  two to three people if that's your thing    what do you care what my thing is   your thing is none of my business  madam   are you flirting with me    no  miss bailey  i'm trying to suggest     to what  insinuate that i like group showers   what next  are you gonna show up at my door tonight with a bar of soap   morning  my apologies for not meeting you at reception   rebecca mitchell  general manager   nina bailey  i'm looking after the band through their european leg of the tour   i hope that my head receptionist has shown you around one of the best suites in our hotel   right down to flushing the john   then i trust that everything's to your satisfaction    yes  thank you   the temperature  the layout    it's all okay   the view  the curtains   we have the same style of curtains but in blue  if that would be more calming   i don't want you to change anything   very well  madam  if you do need us for anything at all      oh  actually  there was something   madam   maybe i wasn't looking hard enough  but i can't remember seeing a welcome basket   welcome basket   fruit  p t   olives   the burlington were kind enough to provide one free of charge    why wasn't there a welcome basket in the room   i assumed housekeeping would do it   first rule of hotel management  never assume anything   if you're not doing it yourself  you can take it for granted that it's not getting done    question  why do hotels love celebrities   because they spend lots of money   and   publicity  when the rich and the famous get drunk and behave badly   they do it under our roof   any tabloid article that mentions these american rock stars   must mention the hotel they're staying at   got it   if you're not up for this  charlie  then tell me now    i'm up for it   i put my trust in you  don't let me down   jackie's been on the phone  she wants a room inspection on 404   ten minutes    any paparazzi turned up yet   not yet   what time did you call them and tip them off  all right  leave it to me    cheers  mate  i owe you   if you get the deputy manager's job  you'll pay

receptionist at the chesterton   well  if she's arriving through the front doors  then she's either a guest  or she's here for a job interview   i'm gonna go and do that room inspection    you wanted a room inspection   yes  please   okay   that's all fine    looks okay to me   me  too   right    we want the junk dogs  we want the junk dogs   we want the junk dogs  we want the junk dogs    what time are they getting here   post gig  should be around midnight   i've also arranged another little welcome surprise for them   excellent   is it my imagination  or are there more bell boys on tonight   when the celebrity circus is in town  everyone wants to work  excuse me   absolutely  madam  that's all organised for you   rebecca  there's something you need to see   okay  thanks very much   i didn't know it was your car until i ran a check on the number plate   no one saw or heard anything  but i've got mustafa running off the cctv tape right now   forget it  it's probably just kids   why don't we just keep this between ourselves for now   we don't want guests thinking their cars are at risk   as you wish  i've got a nephew who works in a garage   he might be able to sort you out a decent rate    thanks  derek   leave it with me  boss   good evening  mrs rautenan  tony from the concierge desk   very well  thank you  yourself   just a courtesy call to let you know that your theatre tickets have arrived   i'll get them sent up to you  madam   come in    your tickets  madam   thank you  could you put them there for me   will there be anything else   my hands are busy  i'd love a chocolate  i don't suppose you could     absolutely  this one   yes  that's fine   mmm    thank you   all part of the service  madam    have a pleasant evening   yeah  thank you    not even a towel over her private areas   nothing   you're the luckiest son of a bitch i ever met   why does nothing like this ever happen for me  eh   because you make your own luck in this world  gino    who is it  please   room service    complimentary drinks from the bar  madam   one moment  come on in   my wife is dressing for the theatre  but please put the drinks on the table   cambiare   a coin has rolled under the bed  i'm afraid   if i lift the corner  could you crawl underneath me to retrieve it    car trouble  i need a room for the night   i'm afraid we're full    charlie  this is me you're talking to   no  seriously  what with the band and      oh   i can phone round    see if there's any vacancies   what  and give money to the competition   was that anna thornton wilton that i saw in the lobby earlier   she came in for the deputy manager position  her cv is very impressive   i'm sure she's very good  considering the short amount of experience that she's had   of course  you have an advantage over her    don't you  charlie   i do   you have a chance to prove yourself in front of me   for example  by ensuring that our bar is sufficiently stocked   for the arrival of our rock stars   funnily enough  i was just about to do that   thank you   what a day  flight delayed by three hours  they misplace my luggage   and then i get a cab driver who decides to take the scenic route   i tell you  today cannot get any worse   you have a room for me  the name's pullins   mr pullins   unfortunately  sir  we've had some electrical problems this afternoon       we're all very excited about having you here   the restaurant's open for another hour  and the bar's at your disposal all night     if you gentlemen need anything  day or night  then please     switch that thing off   we had some problems with porn channels in germany   can you believe the hotel tried charging us treble their standard rate   a mistake like that would never happen here  miss bailey   i've stayed in enough of these air conditioned hell holes to know how they work   biggest money spinning operation i've ever come across   we aim to provide a good service   this suite alone is costing the record company  3 500 a night   how much do you think it's costing the hotel to turn it around   i couldn't possibly put a price on it  madam   let's see  shall we   heating  lighting  washing the sheets and towels   labour charge of a cleaner     10 a day   that's quite a mark up   then you've got the balls to stick a couple of chocolates on the pillows  and call them complimentary   hello   something to do with you   i took the liberty of organising a little entertainment for our rock stars  yeah   i don't think they're gonna be needed tonight   why not  somebody reinvent the wheel  rock stars love hookers   are you coming to samantha's for a drink tonight   i can't  i've got to stick around just in case the band needs something    you're working a double shift   treble  i'm on rota first thing in the morning   well  that takes arse kissing to a whole new dimension   i really want this job   well  if it means anything to you  everyone i've spoken to   wants you to get it   really   yeah  we don't want some hard arse barking orders at us all day    um    people think i'm soft   no  they think you're nice   which means soft  well  i'll tell you what   if i do get this job  i'm gonna be a right bastard to everyone   and you  my friend  are the first on the list   that's right  ladies  keep walking   back to the filthy london gutters you just crawled out of   do i have to be polite to this woman for another 36 hours   well  if you really wanted to be rude to people  you should've trained to be a chef    see you tomorrow   ta ra   charlie  it's funny how busy these places get when there's a whiff of celebrity in the air   everyone wants to see the room where the actress hung herself  or the pop star dangled a baby off the balcony   but you're never the same again after you've worked a nightshift in a hotel   how many times have i told you  four times i called    hello   mr sturridge    yes   it's rebecca mitchell    oh  hello  how are you   very well  thank you   you mentioned on your last visit that if i ever needed a favour i should call you   three mentions of the band  but not one mention of the hotel they're staying at    new dress  rebecca   oh  thank you for noticing  tony   if you don't mind me saying so  charlie  you don't appear to be very fresh     good morning  reception  one moment  madam      concierge desk   tony  damsel in distress   put her through  good morning  madam  my name's tony  how can i help you today   yeah  i can take care of that for you   go see my chemist mate round the corner  pick up a morning after pill     better make it a couple of packs   three peppermint teas and a ginger cake   what about the fights  the fire   the sofa through the windows  the dead hookers in the bathtub   aren't we supposed to be under siege by a rock band   i stopped in at the burlington last night on my way home    spoke to the concierge on duty   and   they had the same problem  looks like the junk dogs have quit the booze   which is why those bastards bumped them onto us   we emptied an entire floor for these people   i'm sorry  but am i the only one who believes they have a responsibility  to spend an obscene amount of money here   i don't think it's the band  i think it's the pa   you bring her down to me  three martinis  she want everyone for fun   the language is a barrier  isn't that right  gino    i speak english as well as you   all the right words  all the wrong emphasis   okay  that's enough  let's turn a negative into a positive  any ideas   don't look at me  if those pussies are not drinking      they're gonna have to eat  eventually   good thinking  charlie   actually  i've got a new caviar supplier due in today  i could ask if he has any almas    14 000 a kilo   and they can smoke   i have some trinidad diplomatics in the humidor     500 each   for a cigar   no disrespect  my darling  but women do not understand cigars   tell me  gino  is it really as complicated as drying leaves   these beauties were handed out by castro in person   i have a half smoked butt from the man himself that is yours for  5 000  eh   now we're talking    mr matthews  how are you today   i'm very well  thank you   i have a case full of kuwaiti dinars   i wondered if you'd be a poppet and stick it in the hotel safe    certainly  sir   don't trust the safes in the room  too flimsy   charlie  could you put this in the safe for mr matthews    right away   sir    thank you  charlie   thank you  mr matthews   car's waiting for you out front  sir  a bottle of bubbly in the chiller   let's shop    the guy driving mr matthews     new kid   well  let's keep him out of the lobby in future  rebecca won't be happy seeing him touting    we'll have a discreet word with the lad   cheers  derek     ah    hi  charlie   hi  anna  how are things at the chesterton   oh  i quit last week  wasn't getting the opportunities that i deserve   which is why you've come here for the deputy manager post   uh huh  yeah  rebecca called me back for my second interview this morning    so looks promising   wow  that's wonderful   wouldn't that be cool  us two working together again  only me as your boss    how cool would that be   yeah   and i don't know about you  but i totally wouldn't feel uncomfortable   about that sex that we had   me  neither   see  as a career woman  i think it's okay  to have sex with a man in a lower ranking position   it's only demeaning when it's the other way round  wouldn't you say so    hi  anna   oh  rebecca  wow  great dress   thank you  little secret  it was off the peg   oh  you see  on most of us that would hang like a rag   come on through to the restaurant   let's have a cup of tea and a gossip before we talk shop   okay  see you again  charlie   oh  charlie  i haven't heard if our rock stars have made a reservation for lunch yet   i'm not sure of their movements   see  at the chesterton  i had this system of suggesting that guests book early for lunch   it sort of plants the idea in their head    sorry  that was rude of me to interrupt   no  not at all   see  charlie  sometimes guests just need a little encouragement    come through   ciao  charlie   ciao  anna   one hawaiian and two vegetarian   15   thank you   how do you get people to spend money when they don't want to   simple  you spend it for them    no way rebecca's gonna give me this job   so what  you're just gonna give up   well  i may as well if i can't even get a rock band drunk   where's your fighting spirit   you said you wanted this job  i mean  it's your career ambition   yeah  you said to me yesterday it wasn't worth the arse kissing   yeah  well  that was yesterday  today i've got money riding on it   derek the doorman took a  10 bet    what are my odds   50 50   it's between you and the goddess who breezed through the lobby earlier    anna   hmm    she ain't all that   oh  yeah  which bits were you looking at   she's not my type   that reminds me  i need to keep an eye on housekeeping    you wanted a room inspection   yes  please    all good   thank you    was there anything else   did you have something in mind    you okay   mmm hmm    you sure   yeah   god  i hate it when guys just want to talk and talk after sex   sorry  weird situation   here you go      wouldn't drink out of that if i were you   why not   all clear   just a little something for you to remember me by     man  one more  one more  man 2  this way  lads   i'm guessing that you're relatively new to this game   so you don't fully understand the rules as yet   so let me start with rule one  you see that line beneath our feet   what line   the line that you never cross again  because when a guest crosses that line  he's ours   we carry his bags  we take his tips   is that clear   off you go   mr matthews    mr matthews  sir   yes  sorry    this came for you   oh  thank you  miles away       i was on the next floor up  and i heard the screams   i thought you were supposed to get some privacy in these goddamn places   i hope this is good enough to get me out of a pilates class  charlie    good god  what happened to her   one of the guests attacked her   which guest    was anything broken   maybe her jaw   no  i mean fixtures and fittings  do we have a viable insurance claim     do we need a translator for this  my serbo croat isn't very strong    english   i do nothing  she attack me   okay  from the beginning   i go in to turn down beds   i knock first  no talk back  i walk in on the bathroom   she  bitch  is powdering lots into her face   powdering her face  you mean applying make up   no  the powder   like a vacuum cleaner  silly cow drop it everywhere   then she go vin diesel on me   thank you  tanya  i think we just about understand     how would you handle this  charlie  what would you do in my position   i'd attempt to find the band alternative accommodation at another hotel   everybody knows they're not spending any money   no other hotel in london will touch them with a stick   then i'd ask them to leave   tempting  but the answer i was looking for is this   we put an extra  50 in tanya's wage packet  and we say no more about the incident   sorry       but is that one of the perks of being the manager  rebecca   you get to shit on your own staff   you know how i said i wanted someone who can stand up to me   this isn't the time   in your interview yesterday  you said the role of deputy manager is to look after the guests    that's right   no  that's wrong   i already employ hundreds of people to do that  waiters  porters  receptionists   in management  your number one responsibility is to maximise profit  and protect the interests of the hotel   this is a business  if you don't understand that  maybe you're not the right person for the job    she's not up there   then i'll wait for her   or you can go back home and try again in the morning   no one attacks one of my girls and gets away with it   jackie  you'll lose your job   you might be scared of rebecca  but i'm not   you've got a child to support   how do you know that   chambermaids will tell you anything for the price of a stamp   i also know you're 27  you rent a two bedroom flat in highgate  and you've got a fantastic arse   if you want to nail her  i'll help you   but there's a much better way of doing it than beating her up   i could slam a door on her hand  accidents happen   if she orders a drink  i'll piss in it  you have my word on that   right  8 00 on a friday night  where can we find every model  boy band  d list celebrity    every ligger in town   how far down the barrel do you want to go   sediment  let's put out the word that the junk dogs  they're throwing an after show party   in their suite and everybody is invited   dave  i want you to get on to maintenance   pictures  vases  anything that's expensive and breakable  move it on up to the 7th floor    what are you up to   well  it's like you said   if they ain't going to spend the money  we'll spend it for them   how's it going   the savoy is sending over another 50 bottles of krug    excellent  charge it all to the olympia suite   one question  charlie    yeah   what size shoes are you    nine  why   when rebecca kills you  can i have them      what    what     good evening  miss bailey   i've taken the liberty of organising a seafood platter  just in case any of the band were hungry    can i offer you gentlemen a spot of caviar   we didn't order any of this   oh  there's no harm in celebrating the end of a very successful tour is there   and you can take that lot away for a start   oh  the drinks  madam  they're not for the band    they're for the guests   what guests   well  you can't have a party without guests  now  can you     wonderful  if you need anything else  i'll be on reception    i want you to put a stop to this right now   oh  i'm afraid i can't do that  madam   i'm in charge of their budget  and we're not paying for any of that stuff   hey  man  can you send up some more of this caviar    right away  sir   and some more smokes  another dozen or so   no problem   of course  these items have now been ordered through reception  so i will have to charge you    this is a con   a con   madam  we have emptied this entire floor for you   we've sent regular paying guests to other hotels in the area in order to accommodate you   i have personally tipped off the paparazzi  the screaming fans  to give you your big warm welcome  and how do you repay us   by beating the crap out of a woman who clears up your shit for the minimum wage    and i'm supposed to feel sorry for her   no  you're supposed to let her do her job   now  if i were you  i'd go back into the suite  enjoy a couple glasses of bollinger   try some caviar   let's face it  anything that comes out of a 100 year old fish must taste pretty special   and i'd smoke a lovely trinidad diplomatic cigar   and i wouldn't even think about complaining       we're not paying for any damage   i'm sorry  rebecca  i just needed five minutes   i don't know what you did last night  and i probably don't want to know  do i    did they cause a lot of damage   let me put it this way   they're the first rock band i've ever known to throw television sets in through the windows   i appreciate the effort that went into that originality    go home and get a shower   i'm on the next rota this morning   and after you've rested  go and see this very good friend of mine  and get fitted for a new suit   savile row  i can't afford     perk number one  the owner of the shop is a regular in our restaurant   he never books  he always expects a table   we scratch his back  he scratches ours   welcome to hotel management  charlie   as of this moment  i'm going to be making your life hell    what are you doing here   oh  rebecca called me first thing this morning  and offered me your old head of reception job  which is better than nothing right now   plus it means i don't have to do all the demeaning donkey work  that the deputy manager gets lumbered with   i'm looking forward to working with you again  anna   that's sweet  me  too   reception  yes  breakfast is served until 10 00   mmm hmm  we have continental  full english and a fruit medley  okay        morning  mr matthews   morning   you're very popular with the staff  sir  we do like generous guests    oh  thank you   but i don't think you are who you say you are   and guests like you never stick around to pay the final bill   how dare you   i want to speak to the manager   sir  i'm pretty sleep deprived at the moment but still in a good mood   so i'm gonna give you a head start   in five minutes' time  i'm gonna call one of my colleagues on reception   and i'm gonna ask her to run a check on your credit card   and if it turns out that you're not the real mr matthews   she'll be informing the police   whatever you wish to do with this information is  of course  entirely up to you   fair game  mate  my briefcase  you put it in the hotel safe   hmm  i don't recall there being a briefcase  sir   right     mr matthews  i can highly recommend the burlington at this time of year   they're often kind enough to direct guests our way   nina  are you okay   charlie  a good hotel is more than just a bed for the night   when you walk through these doors  you can be anyone you want   the important businessman  the honeymooner  the romantic husband   the adulterer  the celebrity   thanks for the party  man  it was just what we needed   our pleasure  sir   or maybe you just need somewhere to hide for a while    bird shit on your back  derek   flying rodent scum     i was sure i knew you from somewhere   i don't know who you've mistaken me for  sir  but i'm not that person   charlie edwards  yeah  i knew it would come to me   good to see you're doing all right for yourself  charlie  i'll be seeing you   prostitutes  can we keep a closer eye on them in future  please   well  i've already called one guest a hooker today   i don't intend to make the same mistake twice   i'm a musician  i write songs   see if we can keep mr machin alive until checking out time tomorrow   this new receptionist  where does she have a tattoo and what is it of   what's with the leather faced people    out   what is with the hostility   how did you manage to spend  2 000 on room service   when his dodgy little heart finally gives out  i'm coming back to see you
