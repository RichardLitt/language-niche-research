tingle   good evening  fellow hero heads   the brentwood powerfan society welcomes electroclash and she force   previously known as late '90s superteam  lady trouble     god  we looked great    that's not actually a photograph   this briefly popular yet short lived superteam  only fought three battles of any note   including one with supervillain  payload     great guy    dead now   and a stand off with power pixie who  let's face it   doesn't really count   we kind of have to give him that   lady trouble split up in the summer of '98  and since then have failed to make their mark    as standalone superheroes    whoa there  spunky   i think you'll find i'm in this month's power express   only in the skirmishes section  lights   and i'm the face of cape shapes  the heavy heroes' diet club   yes  but lady trouble actually meant something to the fans     you were seminal    you smell seminal   i used to write your catchphrase all over my schoolbooks    honesty  integrity  virtue    i still can't believe you chose three words that stand for hiv   i loved you so much  that my mum even made me a she force costume     you used to dress up like she force    every day     he used to dress up like you    i loved my costume so much  that i never used to take it off  even in bed   this is hilarious  but that made my dad angry  and then he called me some bad words and made my mum cry   then my dad left us and went to live with a new family   it turned out powerfizz was doing his sidekick   some twink called silver swallow   how did it end   i shot him     what a cliche    that's pretty harsh  prarsh     with me  it always ends badly    not just with you   i was seeing this lovely fella  lella   and he could only have sex watching this one dvd     you don't like porn    it was  schindler's list    this one guy i picked up could only get off doing role play   you know  gary glitter's holiday  sexy barmitzvah     kindergarten cop    whoa  whoa  what's that   you don't wanna

up with the name lady trouble     who do you fucking think    i thought it sounded girl power   i thought it sounded like a sanitary towel     but why did lady trouble split up    creative differences     we were shit    we weren't  we had our own comic   one issue  which my dad had to pay for       and a theme tune     lady trouble    shut up   that's not nice  no wonder you were never a fan

of which would not be lost on my father   but i can't risk it  thunder monkey hates people bumming in his toilet   we won't get caught   millions of people have sex in public toilets every second of the day   i'm pretty sure that's not a real statistic   we don't have to have actual sex   i can just give you a quick    blob     you know    i can guess what it is  steve     are we gonna do this or
