 you wouldn't find a more devoted father than ripley holden   devoted to what exactly   this time  next year  you'll all be back  for the opening of the ripley holden casino hotel   let's live the dream    a dead man  just there on the floor   dead as southport he was    shyanne   he's finished with me by text    what are you gonna do   i'll start with ripley's wife  i'm good with wives   would you like to go out for a drink with me   it's not possible  it's not what i'm here for   what is it he's done to upset you exactly   he's shut the arcade  which means nobody makes any money   not me  not you  not anybody       on a warm summer's evening    on a train bound for nowhere    i met up with the gambler    we were both too tired to sleep    so we took turns at staring    out the window at the darkness    til boredom overtook us    and he began to speak    he said  son  i've made a life    out of reading people's faces    and knowing what their cards were    by the way they held their eyes    so if you don't mind my saying    i can see you're out of aces    for a taste of your whiskey    i'll give you some advice    you got to know when to hold 'em    know when to fold 'em    know when to walk away    and know when to run    you never count your money    when you're sitting at the table    there'll be time enough for counting    when the dealing's done    every gambler knows    that the secret to surviving    is knowing what to throw away and knowing what to keep    'cause every hand's a winner    and every hand's a loser    and the best that you can hope for    is to die in your sleep    and when he'd finished speaking    he turned back towards the window    crushed out his cigarette    and faded off to sleep    and somewhere in the darkness    the gambler he broke even    and in his final words i found    an ace that i could keep    you got to know when to hold 'em when to hold 'em    know when to fold 'em when to fold 'em    know when to walk away know when to run    you never count your money    when you're sitting at the table    there'll be time enough for counting    when the dealing's done    did you find out where he's getting his money   i'm not sure how that helps us build a case against him  sir     blythe  yeah   i want to know how desperate he is   desperation leads to extreme behaviour   he lied about the victim being at the arcade opening   he's covering something up   we'll be right there   the victim's mates have come forward and identified him  sir   that's what friends are for  yeah   we'll pick up pastries on the way   i know it's a lot to ask in this town but no icing for me   where's the money coming from to pay for more machines   that investment money you transferred for me to pay my tax bill   don't tell me you spent it all on these   i've got private health care  i pay for my kids' education     i'm thinking  what are the government going to spend it on if i do pay it   adventure holidays for kiddie fiddlers   but that doesn't mean you keep pouring money into this place instead   i'm like those gamblers that come in here with just one tactic  forcing   you force a winning streak by gambling every win until you hit the jackpot     and does it ever work    it does if you're lucky     hey  shouldn't you be at school    i've had a job interview   i've never doubted your wonderful commercial instincts  ripley   that's why being your accountant is such a learning curve   however  the fact remains you're not even open for business now   matter of time   allbright's going to sort it  friends in high places   planning permission will come through any day now and     dad  i really need a word     how you doing  ruth    not good   i ate some onion by accident and now i'm paying the price   well  try and think of it as an adventure     i just want to talk to you for a minute    come on  then  office   but i'm not paying jlo off if you've got her up the duff again   erm     the bloke  you know  who died   what about him   i saw him at the arcade opening night party with his mates   so   well  you said you didn't   to that copper   are you trying to make some sort of a point here     not really    let me help you     you think i'm lying to the police    i don't know   and if i'm lying to the police  i must have a reason     i'm not sure    well  i do have a reason     right    do you know what it is     no    never tell a copper anything     not even the time    isn't that wrong   do you want to know about right and wrong   come on  i'll show you   danny  meet chantelle   now  it's my bet she's already blown her giro on the machines  am i right  love   almost     nearly  sort of    give her that   but before you do  you should know that that is deaf barry's pay packet     i don't get it    it's your decision   what   either her kid doesn't eat or deaf barry doesn't get paid   all you need to know is right from wrong   chantelle's a loser  bad  but that means that i can be a winner  good   and my family and friends and deaf barry can share in my good fortune   it's called the trickle down effect   there always has to be a loser   and i spend my life making sure that i'm not it   the right decision is the one that makes you a winner    now that's a decision  can you live with that   this is just     heavy  you know  big thing  big thing   we didn't even know mike was missing till we saw the news   you didn't worry when he didn't show up    at the guest house after your night out    no  not really   it was his stag night   what sort of a man was mike hooley   how do you mean   well  funny  happy  depressed   a bit wild  safe  a good friend   a liar  a cheat  what   well  you know  all of them  really   help yourself to biscuits  lads   so at what point in the evening's events did you and mike part company   what we say here     does his fiancee have to know   i mean  like  if we tell you  does that make it legal and stuff   i thought the availability of pastries  snacks and light refreshments  would indicate the informal nature of these proceedings   we can't use anything you say here in a court of law   right  well     he said he was going to go off and buy a shag   it was his last night of freedom  you know  tradition and all that   sure   where would the institution of marriage be without tradition   is there a technical term for a fiancee who becomes widowed     like pre widow  maybe    i'll try and find out   the groom's mates weren't exactly overcome with grief  were they   maybe they were still in shock     clearly a falling out on the stag night    a big enough falling out for a fight   big enough for them not to check up if he got home all right     about him going off whoring    possibly   so let me guess  i go and interview every whore in blackpool    and you talk to ripley's wife again    no   it'd be a dereliction of my duty to leave you alone with a crowd of working girls   there's a surprise   no   are you still at it   you know what that poor young man was  ripley   a judgement   just the three of you now  is there   you're losing disciples faster than jesus at the last supper   i think you know deep down inside that your days are numbered   beware false prophets  boys   you know what i reckon   i reckon that lad's been killed by one of his mates   you know  been out on the piss  some joke gone wrong   tried to wake him up the morning after the night before  dead   they panicked and they put him in the arcade    why would they put him in the arcade   'cause they nicked some keys the night before     you never told me you had keys stolen    i only just noticed this morning   right   so what do you reckon  danny  sound about right to you   you got a new boyfriend yet  shyanne     is that supposed to be funny    danny  leave it  would you   shyanne  love  come and finish your meal   you happy now   come on  ripley  she should be able to laugh at herself   you got a match tomorrow   what sort of answer's that   facilities you've got at your place  you don't know you're born     new sports hall is finished next month    and how much did you chip in   well  it's all tax deductible   besides  they're going to name it after me   the ripley holden sports hall  really   so what's with the face like last night's balti     it's a pity i'm giving up football    i thought money was tight   one at a time  what do you mean  you're giving up football     well  i'm no good at it    so  play in goal   don't think you're going to be spending more time wanking in your room     you want to just come with me  over here     how's the coffee    it's fine   there's a surprise  i began to think this was the town that cappuccino forgot   this is all very nice   well  i thought we should meet on neutral territory   i didn't think you ladies would come if i invited you to visit the station     you're probably right    so   do you recall this gentleman   no   are you sure   he wasn't a customer of yours   a customer  i've not heard it called that before   as far as i am concerned  you're a service industry worker just like me     thanks    so   this blond bombshell  didn't come and see you tuesday night   no  i'd have remembered   would you   i read somewhere you never remember a client   how you protect your inner self  in a psychological suit of armour kind of thing   except when they die  then it tends to stay with you   who says he died   i heard someone died   then i get invited to neutral grounds and a policeman shows me photos   the reason we wanted to talk to you   one of this gentleman's friends said  he went looking for sex after they'd been to a strip club   i'm not the only working girl in blackpool   i can see that   but  he was seen around the flat you work from   well  if he was  he didn't find me   you're sure you want to tell me no  are you  off the record   yes   that's your final answer   no    i've never seen him before in my life   well  you're not very likely to see him in the future  either   not unless his parents invite you to the funeral   come on  ruth  just have a tidy round  will you   you've got more rubbish than goodison park in there     bloody hell    i come with good news   forensics are about done  you can reopen whenever you like   well  about time   i hate seeing machines without a punter   it's like watching widows dancing on their own   always a poignant sight   oh  and that list of key holders you promised me   no problem   oh  but i noticed i had a bunch of keys missing from the cupboard this morning     you noticed that this morning  did you    i was just about to call you   front grill  door and the alarm code was written on the key fob   somebody got lucky   somebody always does  it's what makes the world go round   a key was missing all along   i had 400 people in here the other night   anyone could have got in the office and got those keys   you're telling me they stole the key on the off chance  that they might need to dump a body sometime   you spoken to the anti gambling crowd  bloke called hallworth   he's always out there  vegetarian  pleasure dodger   i did talk to hallworth  as a matter of fact   he has an alibi   well  anyone can scare up an alibi  can't they   can't they just   you'll be glad to know yours checks out  jim allbright has vouched for you   good   pity he can't vouch for your son danny  too   why would he have to   i'm formally interviewing him tomorrow  danny  i mean  not allbright   you're not talking to my son without me being there   that's why i'm giving you notice   so you can arrange the necessary legal representation   i'll be there myself  don't worry   of course you will   any good father would want to be     hello  again   hello   i came to see you in your other life  at samaritans   yeah  i remember  the questions man   yeah  that's me   so  what are you doing   there you go again  questions  questions  questions     i'm just shopping    right   i see you like tofu  then   yeah  i find it very adaptable   and nutritious and     i don't like tofu  i just saw you in the supermarket  and i came in and pretended to be shopping so that  i had an excuse to contrive a second meeting with you   why would you want to do that   because i wondered if you were doing anything tonight   i'm married  i thought i'd explained that to you   well  you did  but you didn't explain if you were happy or not   and you're the man who's going to make me happy  are you   the man who i met because he came to samaritans     i can see how that might mark me as      suicidal   well  at least you know what you're getting   and let's face it  you know  most men only  reveal their true feelings just before they tell you they're leaving you  so       it really  really wouldn't be a good idea     you know what    what   i have lived all my life doing the right thing   and there's something about you that tells me you have as well   maybe  just this once  you and me should     do the wrong thing   it's not going to happen   okay  but if it was going to happen     where would we meet   a bar called funny girls  8 30    i take on board exactly what you're saying  but the problem with a short run is that we can't make it pay    once we've covered the advertising      hello   sorry  i'll be a moment     hi    where shall we talk   i can't actually talk right now   shall we talk here or go somewhere more private   really  it's a bad time   right  like it wasn't a bad time for me when i got your text message   i'm sorry   i've got to go   steve     when you lie in bed at night what do you miss most   whoa   cover yourself up  for god's sake   so can you see me now  then   come on   i thought you might like to know that the police want to interview you tomorrow   me  what about   that window you smashed in the park last summer   what do you think  the body  stupid     why do they want to interview me    i'll be there  don't worry   why do you need to be there   you think i'd let you go through this on your own   i'll be all right  maybe it's better if you don't come   well  your mother can't go  you know how emotional she gets     she shouldn't even know about this    okay     it's going to be fine    how can you be so sure   we'll black you up  call you  ali   take it to the european court of human rights   how do you think   i've been in deeper shit than this before and i always find an answer   always   it's what i do     look where you're going   hey  sit on that and sing nesse dorma   hey  what did i tell you  a quip for every occasion  we can't lose   i think you need to find someone closer to your own age   someone dull   you want someone different and that's perfectly understandable   maybe that's why you ended up with me   yeah  but you're different to older men as well   like your dad  you mean  well  that's not so difficult   that's what freaked you out  isn't it  meeting my dad   didn't it   no  what freaked me out was meeting him again   what do you mean   i know your dad from years ago   but you can't   why didn't you tell me   well  i didn't recognise him at first  it was a long time ago   i haven't seen him since we were at school together   you and my dad were at school together     i don't believe it    afraid so   it puts a slightly different complexion on things  doesn't it   well  it's a surprise   yeah  of course it is  but     that doesn't have to change anything between us   don't you see  i can't look at you anymore    without being reminded      of what   dad   of the age difference  it's wrong  it's brought it all home to me   we shouldn't be doing it  well  i shouldn't be doing it   steve  what is this about   because you've never thought like this before   well  i think like it now   and that's all that matters  isn't it  what i think now   you'll change your mind   now you're beginning to sound like him   sorry  shyanne  it's all over    the police are talking to all the girls  there's nothing to worry about   was the bloke who talked to you called carlisle     what difference does it make    he's the one to watch   he's slippery   he seemed nice   he's good at seeming anything you want him to be   well  he brought coffee and pastries   well  that settles it  then  let's make him head of the united nations   you wouldn't think he was nice if you saw how he's coming after my lad   your lad   he's interviewed him  when   first thing tomorrow     but what's it got to do with your lad    nothing   he's doing it to get at me  some people have no moral backbone   how is he   he's my son   sharp as a tack   nothing panics him   what are you doing   well  i thought while i were here i might as well collect the rent   what do you think   who are you getting dressed up for   dad  like he's really going to notice   well  i might just be doing it for myself   well  that's just about right in this family   that's what we all do everything for  isn't it  ourselves   look  i know you're upset about breaking up with steve  but you can't carry on being like this   there they are  my two favourite women in the world   did you know you were messing up my life before i was even born   what have i done now   hey  you been spending my money     what's that smell    what smell   on you  like rubber or something   i got a flat tyre  had to change it on the way home   oh  right   are you having a shower   like you said  i stink  what's with all the questions   are you trying to distract me from all the money you spent   no  i just thought my wardrobe needed a bit of sprucing up   well  i won't argue with that   surprised the tramps weren't giving you donations when you did that soup run   you any idea how embarrassing that was for me   is this what we do now  ripley   unwrap an old argument and savour it all over again   where you going  anyway     i don't know yet  i'm meeting the girls    right   unless you want to take me out  of course

because he thought he was using a machine key   if you knew how many tried the machine key trick   you'd know what a stupid question that is   but you did see mike hooley at the arcade  didn't you     you told me    that's right   couldn't miss him  you said  with peroxide hair like that   that's right   except your dad could     because your dad said he didn't see him at the arcade   no comment   i think you're in a bit of a mess right now  because you're trying to cover up for your dad   aren't you  danny   stop harassing the boy   there was a fight in the early hours outside a nightclub called romeo's   there's always fighting   it's like giro day down at the post office in there     i think you were in that fight  danny    no  i'd remember that   how else did you get the cuts and bruises on your hands and knuckles   maybe i did have a fight  yes     and was that fight with mike hooley    no   are you sure   you didn't even know you were in a fight till i just reminded you   danny couldn't have been in that fight   i see  why not   because i put him in a taxi at midnight and sent him home  when i found him drunk outside the nightclub   and why hasn't danny told me that   well  like you've just reminded him  he can't remember a thing about that night   you stood there and you heard me tell carlisle  i'd never seen hooley in the arcade and you told him you had   i tried to tell you that   you made it look like we've something to hide     we have  now    what does that mean   why did you lie like that  why did you say you put me in a taxi   i dragged you out of the deep end and that's the thanks i get   i'm sorry  i messed up  all right   i'm going to ask you now  man to man  father to son     do you remember hitting that lad    no     are you sure    yes  i'm sure     you're not shitting me  are you    no  i'm not shitting you   well  where are you     and the caller was very flattered by his attentions  but now she feels depressed  because she knows whatever she does will make her unhappy   and is she going to see this man again  the caller   no   well  i think that's the right decision   i didn't think you were supposed to express an opinion   that's when i'm talking to callers  not my friends   what do you think   i just think you should be careful   i mean  what do you know about this other man   nothing   that's the attraction   hi  it's me   er     i hate leaving messages   yeah  i'm really sorry that i ran away last night   i was just wondering if you'd like to do the same thing again   the date  i mean  not the running away   hello  were you just listening to all that   no  i'd like to see you  too   yeah  i'd really like that   okay  yeah  bye   sir   i heard from pathology that the victim had taken a cocktail of drugs   if he scored them round here  we need to know who from   we had an anonymous call this afternoon  saying that the victim was seen heading for the white cliff flats behind    holden's arcade in the early hours    i take it this was before he died   three of the hookers we met work out of those flats  and all of them deny having seen mike hooley   there's something to be said for your orthodox approach to police work   there's more  guess who the landlord is     ripley holden    better than that  his wife   his wife  what do you mean   do you think she knows the flats are being used for immoral purposes   holden will be using the name as a tax dodge   i doubt the wife even knows that she owns the property   i find that hard to believe   have you met her  we'll visit the flats in the morning     hello  darling   don't you start  it's been a long day     you could try saying something nice    is it that time of year already   take the chance while you still can   what's that supposed to mean   what if you walked out of that door tonight and died   what if i died   have you been on the herbal remedies again   what if this was your last chance to tell me you love me     you're messing about  aren't you    no  i'm not   what  you want me to say something right now   yeah   something  you know  spontaneous   like what   all right  what do you want to hear   what  i have to tell you   look  i can't be doing with your games right now  natalie           look at that toothless old bugger  he's put his bus pass in her suspender belt   dirty git   that's right  he doesn't appreciate the art like we do   she's an artist  scarlett  i've really seen her improve over the years   what is this  strip idol   you're not a judge  you're just a drooler like the rest of us   i'm coaching her  see that  that's a move i suggested   that's a move every man in this place could've suggested   that's not coaching  terry  it's foreplay   i told you this would cheer you up   yeah  it's doing me good   so now we're all relaxed     perhaps you could tell me what carlisle knows about me   not this again   how did he know about me and the machine key   how did he know danny'd been in a fight before danny did   just lucky guesses   you do it all the time in interviews  see what sticks   so you don't think he's got someone tipping him off at all   what contacts has he got in this town  if he had an informant  i'd know about it   that's right  you would  wouldn't you   listen  terry     i'm sorry about that slap i gave you    forget it   no  it was out of order   you know  i just    everything's getting on top of me   does jim seem okay to you   he always looks well  he's got than sun bed  hasn't he   no  i mean all right in the head   yeah   he seems a bit distracted to me   he's got a lot on his plate   has he  what  like what  money worries  a secret   i don't follow you   i don't think we can trust him anymore     jim    no  tony blair  yes  jim     but he's a mate    is he   and now  welcome on stage once more the lovely  the delicious deena   bloody hell  i don't believe this  i know that voice       i thought you'd be pleased    pleased   you know  you must've been switched at birth   you haven't got an ounce of my brains   it's just a job   how does it make me look  having you work in a place like this   you told me you worked in places like this when you were my age   yes  i did  exactly   but i didn't go to a posh badge school  and have a forty foot bedroom with full en suite facilities     i thought you'd be pleased    this is how it works  right   dad works his bollocks off so son can do better than him   not play records in a tuppenny wankfest and get arrested in a murder case   nobody's said it's a murder case   have you any idea what it's like to look at your own son  and not have a single clue what makes him tick   have you got any idea what that's like   hi   why didn't you show up   i was thinking about what you were saying last night   i was worried you didn't really want to do this   are you sure it was that   are you sure it wasn't you just having second thoughts  and pretending you were doing the noble thing   of course not   well  you could have picked up the phone and told me     but i knew that if i did      you'd have to ask me to your hotel   and i don't know if either of us are ready for that yet   oh     right  yeah  i get it now   get what   i used to know this man   and he would meet a woman  knock her off her feet   charm her  listen to her   wait till he was sure that she was hooked and then he'd walk   it's not like that   because  you see  the best thing for him  was that first exciting spark   the promise  the hope  that's what he got off on   i didn't have you down as that kind of man   i'm holding back because i listened to what you said  i took you seriously   that is great  peter   no  that is priceless   natalie       in that case i don't want no part    i do believe that that would only break my heart    oh  but if you feel like loving me    if you got the notion    i second that emotion    so if you feel like giving me    a lifetime of devotion    i second that emotion    maybe you'll think that love will tie you down    and you don't have the time to hang around    or maybe you'll think that love was made for fools    so it makes you wise to break the rules    oh  little girl  in that case i don't want no part    i do believe that that would only break my heart    oh  but if you feel like loving me    if you got the notion    i second that emotion        natalie   natalie   natalie   would you care to tell me how you feel   shaken   yeah  me  too   because i've finally realised what you've known all along   that this is nothing more than a nice little fantasy   where did you get to tonight   funny girls     ripley    what   would you hold me     you know why you're depressed  don't you   you've been watching queers in dresses all night   you're bound to feel dirty   it's not exactly wholesome  is it   that'll be it  that must be right   do you remember when shyanne was little     she used to draw flowers on her legs in biro   we should have known then she'd go for blokes with tattoos   i was always so scared when her and danny were young   hey  what's got you on this   i thought that when they grew up everything would be all right   we are going to be all right  aren't we   of course we are   you okay now   i'm fine   you comfy like this   yeah     ripley    what   can it not be about sex   can it just be about holding me   sure   yeah   of course it can
