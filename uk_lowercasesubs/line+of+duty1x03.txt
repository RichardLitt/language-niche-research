if you want to talk  call me into ac 12   why go to all that bother when i'm only after a minor detail   the reason you took over a hit and run   gates was with a woman in a cafe  you think she's his girlfriend   well she doesn't appear in his statement   she came to the station  they talked  something felt odd    inspector tony gates  do you know him   i met him briefly at the police station   that's the extent of your relationship   the coroner's set the date to reopen the inquest in the karim ali shooting   you're going to be asked to testify   the fire arms officers are saying you sent them to the wrong flat    i am the senior investigating officer on a double murder   that is proper policing son   tony gave me back the motivation   he's a good man  you remember that   arnott's on to you  i don't know how   the hairdressers  you might as well have hung up a sign saying    launder your drug money here    no  please don't do this   hey  this is happening jackie   think dot and morton are covering for gates   he's got to be at jackie laverty's right now  on my way   i'm a police    huh  no    gotcha   all right son  calm down   what's going on   i've checked all of the ground floor   i got here a few minutes ago to arrest her   front door was open and there's blood everywhere   we should look upstairs   what are you waiting for  arnott   she's not up here  there'd be a blood trail   my team   well  what   did you want to check the bedrooms or not   yeah   you should check the rest of these   i'm going to have a look around the back   everything ok  sarg   yeah  round the back  quick as you can  see if you can find her   right  boss   gates   where is she   i know as much as you do   this was a kidnapping or a robbery  a meeting  whatever   it went tits up   we're gonna start the door to door and get the dogs out   no  you don't get to lead this investigation   you don't tell me what i can and i can't investigate  all right  son   no sign of her outside  tone   all right  get door stepping  dot   nige  lock off the house and set up a cordon   ds cottan  no  where are you   no  you're breaking up   can i help you  ds arnott   i think i can manage  thank you  dc fleming   do this now  please  dabs and dna   yes  sir   oi  this is my crime scene  not yours   log him out  deepak  and don't let him back in   please   sorry  sir  so tell us  steve  what have you got   jackie laverty went missing this morning  missing   she was attacked in her home and now there's no sign of her   she wasn't just hiding a hit and run   i've believe she was involved in money laundering   what and you think you can connect gates with all this   call him in for interview  sir   before he has time to work out his story  i need one hour   good morning  rita   morning   i need to talk to you about a hit and run investigation  that was taken over by dci gates   you're ac 12  aren't you   yeah   see  erm     my union protects civilian support staff from talking to you  in case it causes undue stress and anxiety   sorry   i could always arrest you for perverting the course of justice   take a seat   when exactly did dci gates take over the case   when the information came through from county cid   what information   from missing persons  about mr patel   the victim   when dci gates heard that mr patel had been jackie laverty's accountant   that's when he took over the     case   ac 12 interview   present superintendent hastings  ds arnott  dci gates   the police federation representative dci alice prior   may i  sir  perhaps we could postpone this interview   dci gates has only just learned that a personal acquaintance  is missing  presumed dead   he's calling her an acquaintance now   let's do this   as it happens  ds arnott's point was a good place to start   dci gates  how would you describe your relationship  with jacqueline laverty   jackie and i knew each other  she was jackie o'connor back then and we were engaged  but she broke it off to marry a businessman called andrew laverty  and we lost touch   we were reacquainted some five months ago   she told me about her property business  and that she was after a head of security   she wondered if i might recommend some recently retired officers   and i made the mistake of giving her my card   mistake   yeah  she called me the next day  and the day after   and the day after and the day after   she wasn't interested in ex officers   jackie was recently divorced from andrew laverty  and she made no bones about  wanting to pursue a sexual relationship with me   and how did you respond   i told her that i was now a happily married man  with two young daughters   she wouldn't take no for an answer   and over the course of the next few months   jackie laverty became my stalker   and did you report this   no  sir   why not  dci gates   because she's a good looking woman  sir  and we had a past   and there's no smoke without fire  is there   so can you tell me how you became involved in the hit and run  incident that ms laverty reported   well  actually  sir  initially it was reported as a stolen vehicle   it was only afterwards that the vehicle was linked  to the hit and run   are you aware the victim of the hit and run was  jackie laverty's accountant   dci gates is entitled to be questioned by an officer  at least one rank superior   are you aware that the victim of the hit and run was  jackie laverty's accountant   yes  sir  when did you act on it   and when did you act on it   what is this  keith harris and orville   it's all right  alice  let them fire away   as soon as i became aware of that information  i acted on it   so straight away   not straight away   i was concerned about jackie's manipulative behaviour   but once i set that aside  i acted properly   by attempting to arrest her for manslaughter   she had a large house  luxury cars  expensive offices   didn't you ever wonder where the money was coming from   she appeared to be a successful businesswoman   settlement in her divorce   you had no idea at all there might be some financial irregularity   absolutely none at all  sir   dci gates  how did you come by the information  that jackie had killed her accountant   this is the critical piece of evidence against your stalker   surely you remember exactly how you found out   dci gates was not prepared for this line of questions   i request them in writing with the statutory ten days to respond   rita bennett informed me  the civvie support   i took a statement from rita bennett prior to this interview   i wonder if her recollection matches yours   dci gates   the information came in from county cid  regarding the identity of the victim   that was three days after ms laverty informed me about her stolen car   you should have a copy of that statement   yeah  i'll see to that  alice  yeah   the information you've just given  why isn't it in the computer file   why    your answers match what rita said  and what she claims she entered in the file but it's not there   why not   she must be mistaken   you deleted it   stop right there  we're all aware of it problems as a day to day reality   have you any proof that this file was deleted   we could impound the hard drive   the database can be accessed by any computer from the mainframe   do you intend to impound them all  ds arnott   send the whole station back to bikes and whistles   dci gates's relationship with jackie laverty clearly affected  his handling of the hit and run   it's inappropriate for him to remain so on her disappearance   i was not the problem  she was  i went to arrest her   it's something that you should put to tony's superior officer   well  i certainly will  alice  if he'll deign to respond   can we go  please   dci gates   i have mobile phone records relating to your account  and jackie laverty's account   sit down  please  dci gates  sit down   these came over this morning  alice   you'll see last week's authority for the release of phone data   the most recent records are consistent with your testimony   calls and texts from ms laverty directed to your phone   none of the calls answered by you  one way traffic   go back a little further  and you're calling her  texting her   would you like me to read an example of one of the text messages  sent by you to ms laverty last month   dci gates   no   so  can you tell us  your true relationship with jacqueline laverty  please   we had a one night stand  for old times' sake   i wanted to end it but she used it against me   sir  i was protecting my family   well  i think it's fair enough to say that we have grounds to  remove you from the case  dci gates   fine  sir  fine  thank you  dci gates   where were you last night  hold your horses   it's a simple question  you don't have to respond  dci gates   if it's too short notice to come up with an alibi   let's leave it there  tony   i went home very late   i didn't want to wake my wife  so i slept in the spare room   but i couldn't sleep for worrying about the case against jackie   so that's when i decided to go and arrest her   witnesses  as i said  i was careful not to wake my wife   so you didn't spend the night with jackie laverty  no  i did not   why didn't you call for back up  back up  when   when you arrived  alone  and found evidence of extreme violence   well  i knew that my team were en route   and when you turned up  i assumed between the two of us  we were up to the task   i had to climb over the gate  how did you get in   how    did you climb over the gate   no  i  um    your car was parked on the drive   either you climbed over the gate with it tucked under your arm   or jackie laverty let you in   i opened the gate   what's the code   tell me the code   it'll be on jackie's contact information   there    i think we should call it a day  yeah  i think so too   sir  i sincerely hope you don't consider you have enough  grounds to press for suspension   dci gates has been extraordinarily co operative     the last number on jackie's account  a mobile she called last night    who did she call   i got no idea   you weren't present when she made that call  no   that's enough  steve   sir  dci gates has no criminal case to     forensic scene investigators are currently harvesting dna and fibres from the house   yeah  and they are likely to find some of mine  you know  from a previous visit   because i'm not denying i wasn't ever there   and  of course  i was there this morning  with you   interview terminated   no suspension   thank you  sir   tony   but you know ac are all over her   ac are all over everything at the moment   look  i've let you down   i had a relationship that's compromised me professionally   but none of it  really  none of it reflects on any of you   in fact  it makes your loyalty all the more humbling   but a woman's missing   almost certainly deceased   and chief superintendent hilton is in the process  of appointing another officer to lead that investigation   and we will render that officer every assistance  ok   hi  ds arnott   i called this morning   the glass found at the scene is teeming with evidence   it's very moist   we sampled saliva from around the rim  and we got two high quality fingerprints from the side   the prints appear to be from the same person   initial assessment is they match the control prints from the house   they're jackie's  yeah   what about the whisky bottle  sorry     no  nothing   just jackie's prints again  you mean   no  i mean nothing  it's been wiped down   thank you   i'll be back for the dna reports   from now  our focus shifts completely  to the double murder on greek lane and the killing of wesley duke   so     excuse me  you better come quick  sir   can't keep his nose out  can he  eh   hey  ds arnott   kindly desist   i want this car impounded as evidence   i want it cordoned off and i want him kept away from it   then get yourself a warrant   what are you looking for   shergar   he wiped down the whisky bottle  but i know there's a glass missing from the crime scene   he took it cause it's the only thing that proves he was there   oh  now you're screwed  tone     he's onto your george michael cds   we done   find anything  sherlock  you're wasting your time  mate   a thorough search of the property  revealed no clues to jackie laverty's whereabouts   we did a ring around of local hospitals   no one matching her description has been admitted   we established a track on her mobile phone   nothing   it's been switched off all day   that's as far as we got when gates was brought off the case   he fought tooth and nail to keep it   he knows what the forensics are going to sound like  in front of a jury when the body's found   whoever killed jackie did it quickly  and moved the body without leaving a trace   it sounds like a professional job  maybe she won't be found   that whisky glass is the only physical evidence  that can place gates at the crime scene  what   the search on gates' car   it came over as desperate   he's the one who's desperate   i push him from the outside  you push from the inside   he'll crack   make him lead us to that whisky glass  kate   forensics never found anyone's dna  except the two victims'   professional crew then   gloves  the works   the search never found any sacks of drugs stashed under the floorboards   but there was residue   very pure crack cocaine   well  maybe they weren't just muscling in  on somebody else's territory   they were out trading on quality   i want to get over to the alleyway   i want to familiarise myself with wesley's murder   do you mind if i tag along  sir   just give me a minute   dci gates   jesus bloody christ  we could all go down the pan with him   hey  he stood by you   don't make out he's some kind of saint   we all tick a box for tony in front of the top brass   yeah  and we all know which box you tick   screw you  nige   wondering if you backed the wrong horse are you  dot   whoever committed the murders at greek lane knows we're after them   they couldn't have been more blatant in showing they're behind this one   so you think this was a warning   well  maybe they're taunting us   a double murder behind closed doors is one thing   this is a triple now   and they hung wesley up there for everyone to see   sir  we've got cctv in for greek lane   there wasn't any cctv on the street   footage from nearby traffic cams   get back to the station and go through it  please   yes  sir   sir  who's taking over the jackie laverty case   di ian buckells  why   well  the whole station heard arnott accuse you  of being with jackie laverty last night   arnott's got nothing on me   that's not what i meant  sir   you've lost someone close   i'm here  if you need to talk   tony    hey  darling  i'm really sorry  about     i'm just glad you're ok   one of your team's been telling me about last night   hello  sir   actually  mrs  gates  i'm not on your husband's team   i'm in another department that's taking an interest  in last night's events   where are the girls   they're at clubs   this is work  darling   come on  sammy   thanks   get out   mrs g was relieved to hear you were working last night   i wondered if you'd dropped in for a nap in the spare room   like you stated in your interview   she explained the bed hadn't been slept in   it seems there's very strong circumstantial evidence  telling me your statement is false   circumstantial evidence   that's the best you've got   i know you wiped down the whisky bottle and moved the glass   that glass is hard physical evidence you're an accessory to the crime   but it's evidence you don't have   i'll find it   you've got this one chance to call your solicitor   come to the station and change your statement   before it's too late   i'm not going to do your job for you  arnott   if you want to take me down  you're going to have to do it yourself   now get the fuck out of my house   when you're in a hole  stop digging   for your wife's sake   for your daughters'   get out   nice house   shame   have a good day  sir   thank you again  mrs gates   what the hell were you up to last night   i'm handling a triple murder   he's ac 12   it's  erm  anti corruption   anti corruption   oh  my god  tony   they've got nothing  which is why he's so desperate   he's got something on you  though  hasn't he  no  really nothing   why's he round our house   because he's a prick  darling   what are you going to do   i'm going to sort it   can you   i can and i will   i promise   jools   how dare you  no one can ever come between me and my husband   you keep away from this family   hey     i've developed a rough timeline of the night of the greek lane murders   four hours before the murder   that's the unmarked car carrying dot and deepak   they went straight into position on greek lane   skip on two hours   a subaru is heading from moss heath to kingsgate   takes the same route   he's driving circuits   each circuit would allow him to swing by the borogrove estate  where the lads are parked   i'll skip on two hours  that's dot and deepak leaving the area   five minutes later  here comes the subaru  round the junction again   no more circuits  in fact  we don't see it again   and what have we got on the vehicle  registration belongs to an identical make and model   they've cloned the plates  they harvest the cars for the jobs and then dump them   let's get patrol to be on the lookout for all vehicles with cloned plates   yeah  i've already done it  sir   that's a good job  kate   i want everybody in on time tomorrow  please  yeah   you dirty bastards   thanks  wanker   oi   mrs pilkington  ryan   it's the police   keely   mrs pilkington  it's pc bannerjee from kingsgate station   ryan was meant to come in to give a statement this morning   what this time   we intervened in a street altercation  mrs pilkington   ryan alleges he was assaulted by an elderly neighbour  mr alf butterfield   can i come in  please  keely   i checked at his school  they said he hadn't been in all week   keely  where's ryan  how should i know  this is serious  keely   ryan's failed to attend for his interview  what's it gotta do with me   well  he needs to be accompanied by a responsible adult   that's his social worker  innit   well  if the little bugger's not here  there's no case to answer   i'm sorry  mr butterfield  you've already generated a crime number  there's no room for manoeuvre   pc larkin means either you accept the caution or it goes to court  take the caution   home in time for bargain hunt   yeah  but that will mean you have a criminal record for a public order offence   but     criminal record  well  he    he's the bloody criminal   fine   have it your own way   there    there was a detective   now she said she'd take care of everything   yeah  i wrote down her name   ah  this is all her fault   there     fine  show him in   thank you   sorry  tony  sorry  worst possible timing  i've got to dash  i only need a minute  sir   the interview with ac 12 puts us in a delicate position   i thought it best to come clean   that's admirable but  really  i'd rather let the dust settle before we have a definitive conference   i'll have sheila put something in the diary   you weren't so shy about standing by me when the chief constable was hanging a medal around my neck  sir   yes   ah  ah  ian  tony  you know di buckells has taken over the laverty disappearance  yeah   any news   we've got the dogs out  sir  but there's no trace of the body yet  that's disappointing   we're developing her money laundering as a lead  and      sir  we've had a major breakthrough on the triple murders   you have  yes  we should have it cracked    two  maybe three days   i can take that to the chief constable  absolutely  sir   well  that's excellent  well done  tony   we should  er     don't make any assumptions about jackie laverty's fate   she was facing a manslaughter charge  she could've faked this whole thing   right    she had the cash and the connections to get herself out of the country   maybe her ex is involved  ok  erm    ac are talking crap about that whisky glass   don't make a tit out of yourself chasing shadows   i've seen too many ambitious young dis looking up the ladder  without realising they've stepped on a big slippery snake  do you know what i mean   good to see you   sir   patrol sighted a vehicle with cloned plates on moss heath road  back up's ready to roll  ok   mobilise

that doesn't exist   what if it did  give me the chance to prove myself to you  this is a conversation we shouldn't be having   well  if arnott finds it  that's your career over  sir   a genuinely talented officer  all for one silly mistake   i'm not bent  ok  i'm not  you know that  right   yeah   where is it  sir   it's in a skip   who the bloody hell do you think you are  easy  tone  that's

story about a phantom piece of evidence   and i told you that it was in a skip  nige i told it was in a ditch and dot that it was in a pond   deepak  he's the one i told it was in that drain  i've been up all night   weighing up my career against helping you out  no  kate  that's not what i    you bastard  sir   kate  kate   i was acting on apparently reliable information   we've had a contact request from colin brackley  he was the senior fire officer     screw him  i wouldn't burn my bridges if i was you  son  not now   let me buy you a drink    i'm not staying   just say what you came here to say   the lads are all getting twitchy  we've all been suspended from active duty   and we've heard you're going to accuse us of lying to cover up breaking into the wrong flat   and you're saying i screwed up the orders  sent you in the wrong door   this has got out of hand  that's why i'm here   it took guts for you lot to go in there  thinking he was a bomber   all i know is  we've all been asked to lie and i'm the only one not going along with it   we both know there was a massive failure of intel  the op was thrown together without proper prep   no one responsible wants to cop for that  that's why they're laying it on us   there's no  us    there is if we all tell the same story   and in return  none of the lads put any blame in my direction   we're in this together  steve   an innocent man is dead   there's not a day goes by i don't think about that   i was the one who pulled the trigger   i'm sick with it  man   i can't sleep at night   i can't look any other copper in the eye   i'm bouncing my little boy on my knee and i just burst out crying for no reason   you feel it too  don't you  the guilt   you knew the kill order was suspect  if you hadn't passed it on     let me get you another drink   nothing's going to bring him back  so what good does it do for us to be thrown on the scrap heap   isn't it better  isn't it a better service for us to put this behind us  and be the cleanest  most dedicated officers on the job   you've already figured that out  haven't you   that's why you joined anti corruption   a pint  please   you're finished   you're over the line here  son  you're way over the line   you take a shot at the king  make sure you kill him  son   so you're going to take all of us down with you  are you  sir   you arrogant wanker   what do you

it would be great to get your     you want to speak to a member of my team   put in a request  in writing  to me   er  excuse me  sir  i've been meaning to talk to you   erm  all this anti corruption  it's  er  bad for me nerves   i'm sorry to hear that  rita  i'll have to go on the sick   you'll be missed   i don't know  in the last three months my migraines have got worse   i'm sure my union will have something to say about it   i'm sorry  ted  i know you've been chasing me   it occurred to me that neutral ground often makes for more productive conversations   it's always nice to get out of the office  sir   frankly  i've been avoiding this conversation   i was beginning to feel a wee bit like the ginger stepchild  there   i spent two years in ac myself   i see this situation from both sides   if gates had solved the triple murder   he could've shaken off these allegations   now  he's a dead man walking  so why keep digging   well  for proof  sir  proof that tony gates was at a murder scene   there are only so many drains you can look down before ac 12 becomes a laughing stock   we've followed procedure to the letter  sir   i don't doubt it for a minute  but tony gates is  uh  from the south   i'm sure you'd be mortified  ted  mortified   if anyone formed the opinion that ac 12 makes  a point of pressing charges against officers from the south   everyone receives the exact same treatment   of course  of course  it's a delicate balance   but no one would welcome the accusation that the case against an officer from the south  was being pursued with unusual alacrity   yeah  i'm here   'your bird's money laundering is going to lead your lot to me   'you better get it sorted out '  look  erm     i can't make a move without being watched   'that's your problem  you bent bastard '  dad   hey  darling   we love it when you pick us up  do you   what are you doing here   well  i thought i'd surprise you  munchkin  is that all right  yeah   give me a hug   on a separate note sir  we've had a complaint against dc fleming     er  from alfred butterfield   failure to assiduously investigate burglary and assault   that's small fry  station level   yeah  it's all to do with her time at the cid   i've had a look at the facts again   i think dc fleming really should return to normal duties at to 20   yeah  it's your call  excuse me   yeah
