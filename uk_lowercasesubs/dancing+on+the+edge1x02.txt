clock chimes  this programme contains some strong language and some scenes of a sexual nature   i don't think anyone's watching the building   not yet  anyway   not yet  no   better keep away from the window  though  just in case   do you think you can sleep   i don't know   usually  i can sleep anywhere  but tonight  i'm not sure   ah  so you're not as calm as you look  thank god for that   you were beginning to make me nervous   where are you going   i'm going to try and find something to eat   and i've got to work out a way of getting you out of the country   'i'm going to make you the new number band in britain  naturally '  'mr masterson asked if i would clear this up   what a mess   'i was so clumsy last night   goodness knows what people must think   mr masterson's having a picnic  you really must join us   is anybody sitting here   no  by all means   i'm very ambitious  louis  so should you be   do you think i'm not   she's incredible  isn't she  do you think she'll ever like me   i need to find something to really impress her   'mr holt is a british citizen '  'the deadline cannot be extended   'nor is there any other process of appeal '  that important telephone call is taking place as we speak   i do hope you will be here to entertain your future king   applause   jazz music plays  when do we get the cake  mummy   it must be time for the cake   where is the cake   where is the cake    listen to the funny music   it's a very nice cake  mummy   but why haven't the band got those black and white faces   you said they would have black and white faces   louis   what are you doing here  i've got some business with mr schlesinger   anyway  that's not much of a greeting  louis   you're the last person i want to see  why  what have i done   that's exactly the point  stanley  you've done nothing   remind me of what i was meant to be doing   don't try that  you know perfectly well   we are without a manager  i'm having to do that myself   and we're playing children's birthday parties   you're still the top featured band in this hotel   and no one's going to get deported while you're here   we've not been on the wireless  we haven't made a record yet   i seem to remember somebody boasting they could make us  the number one band in britain  and i will   i haven't changed my mind about that  these things take time   i thought that's what you believed in  louis  things taking time   mind you  i quite like seeing you a bit impatient   oh  you do  do you   oh  i'd better not  not after what happened to wesley   yes  and that's the most serious  of course   i still don't know what really went on  how do you mean   you know exactly what i mean   i don't know why he was thrown out of the country   mr donaldson told me he was handling everything  he lied to me   that's a serious charge  louis   do you want the opportunity to say it to his face   so you wanted to see me  mr lester   yes  i did  very much   the bar is closed but perhaps i can use my influence   since it is almost the legal hour  and get you a glass of wine   no  thank you  i don't need anything   except to know if i lied to you   whether i ever really tried to stop your friend from being deported   you'd like to know that  wouldn't you  i would  yes   sometimes one overstates what one can do   maybe out of arrogance or a desire to please   it's a terrible thing to suddenly be thrown out of the country   it is  yes  and i don't know what happened to him   i probably never will   and now you have no manager  and you're stuck playing in this old place   it's good to have a regular job  of course   i thought that after the prince of wales heard us play   and all that excitement    you were going to be making records   you were going to be on the wireless   yes  i did think that   the trouble is  mr lester   the people in charge of these places are quite unbelievably conservative   sir john reith  for instance  at the bbc  detests jazz music   so it's never going to happen  then   mr lester  i'm a man of leisure who is addicted to the new   whose chief excitement in life is spotting and encouraging new talent   i do want to help you  will you let me do that   it depends in what way   i've actually come with a request right now   lady cremone   an old friend of mine  would like you to play at a funeral   to play at a funeral  and that's going to help us   yes  whose funeral is it   her estate manager   she is a very interesting woman  lavinia   we tend to get excited about the same things   she's become a bit of a recluse recently   she lives in an appalling remote spot   you will be staying in her house  but that's no guarantee that  you will get to meet her   but if you do  mr lester   she is someone who knows even more important people than i do   stanley will be going to the funeral to try to get to meet her   and so will sarah   drums beat  children laugh  slow jazz music starts    lord  lead me on    lord  lead me on    guide me on my final journey    lead me on  lord  lead me on       oh  mr lester  i want to thank you  from the bottom of my heart   for coming all this way and playing for charlie   we're delighted to be here  ma'am   he would be so thrilled   he is so thrilled   he had all the latest gramophone records sent over from america   yes  he did   there's one in his coffin now  there is   you will come and play for everybody later   please  i   i know they would so like that   oh  do say yes   jazz music plays  do i dare   dare what   do i dare run over there   i don't know what's stopping you  stanley   you're right   your ladyship  forgive me  i just wanted to introduce myself   i'm stanley mitchell  i'm friends with the musicians   are you a journalist   blimey  is it that obvious  is it  yes  yes  i am   i have nothing against journalists  i just never talk to them   and certainly not at funerals  of course   i understand that  but  actually  we might bump into each other  later on today because you're kindly allowing the band to  stay on your estate  and well  um  i've always wanted to meet you   and just in case we run into each other later on   i just thought i'd say hello   and now you've done it  and at considerable length   oh  er  i don't expect it will mean anything to you   but i'm deputy editor and chief writer for music express   are you  mr mitchell  how very interesting   why don't you come for tea at 4pm   you and the band leader  mr lester   did she invite me too  do you think  to tea   of course  you know her  anyway   i don't know her   i photographed her once in london  and she didn't like that very much   here goes   this was the perfect funeral for charlie   i know there is the view that your kind of music can only appeal  to a very small audience  but we saw just now in the village  how all sorts of people can respond   you're absolutely right  your ladyship   i'm sure you're wondering if i know anything about music   your music  someone of my age   i wasn't wondering that   mr mitchell  if you would be so kind   over there  on the second shelf  can you see the red binders   blimey  i don't believe it   bound copies of music express   i've never seen that in somebody else's house before   of course not  i don't suppose anyone else would be mad enough   i know what i'm about to say is very stupid   well  what is it  mr mitchell   you wouldn't   you wouldn't  would you  let me interview you  now   i've always wanted to interview you   well  that would depend on the quality of the questions   sarah  louis  you want to go  and have a look at the garden  don't you   they giggle  stanley  he's incorrigible  he's such a rogue   don't change your mind  i think i've already changed my mind   no  no  you can't   i hate talking about myself  i always have   i am going to say   is it true    and you're going to agree  or rather  if you'd be so kind as to agree  or not   and i'm going to see how many i get away with before you stop me   now  is it true noel coward sends you all of his plays  to read before he puts them on   yes   is it true that you told mgm to sign greta garbo  after you saw her in a swedish film   well  when i was living in america  i spent time both in new york  and los angeles  and so i met all sorts of people   some of them were in the film business   and sometimes they asked for my opinion   i'm going to say that's true  then   this must be the memorial garden for her sons   all three of her sons were killed in the war   all three  that's terrible   yes  how do you get over something like that   are your parents still alive  louis   no  they're not   my father did fight in the war  but he didn't die in it   yes  there were coloured soldiers  sarah   i'm sorry  i didn't mean to look so surprised  i've just never  heard of that before  but of course there must've been   yes  he survived the war  my dad   but both my parents died in the flu epidemic   it happened very quickly   what did you do   that's when i started travelling  went to all sorts of places   i spent time in paris playing in bars  time in new york   and a lot of time on the ocean liners  as you know   so you've seen more of the world than i have   yes   is it true that you've been trying very hard to get different  things played on the wireless  a more exciting repertoire   especially jazz music   but i've been extremely unsuccessful so far   now  mr mitchell  this has got to stop   it's been oddly enjoyable  but that's quite enough   just one more  please   is it true that famous artists have trekked across the world  to see you  just turned up on your doorstep   that is not true  are you sure   that is not true  mr mitchell  now shall we      but is it possible somebody could come here  almost by accident   who was extraordinary  and then you want to see them properly   you mean the louis lester band  and of course the singer jessie   ah  that young girl   yes  i saw her sing at the funeral   yes  but you were an awfully long way away   can she sing again for you in the morning   she shivers  you too  oh  my god  it's freezing  isn't it   so cold  we just had to have some tea   yes  i don't think i've been this cold in my life   perfect   right  i'm going to go back with this   see if i can make it through the night  cheerio   isn't it funny  a lady with such modern taste  and her house is this cold   he laughs  and it creaks  too   that's a bit warmer  isn't it   he clears throat  i think she might be awake   so best not to take any chances  night night   we're not late  are we  your ladyship   no  no  any time during my breakfast will do   so  my child  would you like to sing something for me   i'll try  yes     wind blows round the steeple    empty world and sleepy people    i lie awake and listen    for the midnight train a whistlin'       what's the matter  child   i don't think jessie has ever seen an artichoke before   have you not  my dear   well  then you must have one  of course  at once   camera clicks  that's very good  your ladyship  hold it like that   did she say anything about jessie   no  not a thing   are there going to be many more of these   i'm beginning to wonder why i agreed to it   just one or two more   have we done ourselves any good  do you think   it's quite hard to tell   i really don't know what she is doing on the cover  lady cremone   of course i've heard of her  i know who she is   but she's not a bandleader  she's not a musician of any sort   what on earth is she doing on the cover    you agreed to it  mr wax   i don't believe i did  stanley  you must have misheard me   and yet again  there is an article on the louis lester band   i've lost count of the number of articles you've done on them   they are going to be the biggest band in britain  and we will have helped create them   there he goes again  he's always exaggerating   stanley  you make me laugh  with all your claims  you really do   do you think i'm exaggerating   maybe  mr wax is right  you often do   you're still angry with me  rosie  aren't you   no  i know what to expect from you  stanley   after all  i've seen enough of it over the last two years   quite enough   you're not quitting  are you  of course not   i know this magazine is going to really grow   and soon you won't be able to write it all yourself   you'll be looking round for another writer   and there'll be one right here in this office  won't there   and so there will  rosie   there you are   i just dropped by to give you this  these are for you  jessie   oh  thank you  mr luscombe  they're beautiful   and these are for you   for me  yes  i meant to get them the same size   no  don't worry about that  they're lovely   look at this room   no  i won't come in  thank you  but this room isn't nearly good enough   we love this room  oh  it's the best room i've ever slept in   no  no i'd like to arrange something better for you both   i can do it easily   no  no  please don't  we're really happy here   please don't  mr luscombe   oh  well  if you don't want me to  then i won't   soon of course  you'll be staying in the biggest suites  in the most fashionable hotels all across the world   that's not going to happen  mr luscombe   oh yes  and people are going to be crossing the atlantic just to  attend one of your concerts  and they'll wait for nights  in the street  just to get a glance of you as you drive away in a car   you mustn't do this  mr luscombe   and when you go abroad  even to the most faraway places   people will come running out of their houses into the street  calling your name and blowing kisses   julian     i can't believe it  he's found me  even up here   julian   it's my employer   julian   excuse me   you have to go    the audience are crying out for a more exciting choice   of music on the wireless  and this has to be delivered now    at the moment  they are being fed a tired   and familiar diet  the same bands every night of the week    what do you think so far  mick  quite strong stuff  mr mitchell   damn right   listeners will soon be switching off in droves   or hunting to find more exciting sounds    readily available from rival stations abroad    oh  it's you   oh  it's me  yes   give this to rosie   tell her to take a look at it and see if she approves   sorry  you took me by surprise   don't worry  most people don't say   oh  it's you  when they see me   so i suppose you can   i'm just a little behind  is all  i'm interrupting  forgive me   no  you're not  i'm always behind  and er  well  i always catch up   i'm very glad to see you   i'm glad to see you too  stanley   please   i think about you  every week  when i read your magazine   you think about me just once a week  is that all   yes  but that's quite good  isn't it  hmm   i know you think i'm not really interested in your magazine   did i ever say that   no  but you think it   i have noticed a few things  it's changing  isn't it   it's getting more political   i wouldn't go that far  i still have to get everything past wax   but you're sneaking more and more things in   like   farquhar and tonk running a soup kitchen   that's right  we managed to get that past mr wax   you'll laugh  but as it happens  i know what it's like to be hungry   you do   you don't have to look quite so serious  stanley   i starved myself for ten days a couple of years ago   i could say it was to try and understand what it's like to  be really hungry  but actually  i was just trying to  shock my parents  who are quite the dullest people in england   don't say anything to that  stanley   probably best i don't say anything  no   so you can put me in this cartoon   looking like a skeleton  mad eyes popping out   dressed in a ball gown with a coronet on my head   you think i'd do that   yes  stanley  i really think you would   there's a telephone call for you  mr mitchell   yes  i'm coming   hello   i'm on the cover of your magazine  mr mitchell   you never said you were going to do that   it was too good an opportunity to miss  i hope you don't mind   well  it's an extraordinary thing to do   'i'm not a performer  who wants to see what i look like '  more people than you think  i should be furious with you   'in fact  i am furious with you  but that's not why i'm ringing you   'i have another reason  something a little more interesting '  i've had a notion  mr mitchell   he hums  hello  louis   you're not going to like what i am about to say to you at all   same as most days  then   you've got to go back to that basement club where we first met   says who   says me  you're going to play the most important session of your life   deirdre  you look magnificent   thank you  stanley  i don't often get a chance to dress up like this   i hate to say this  deirdre  but you need to clean this place   it's been cleaned  what do you think i've been doing   we're not leaving anything to chance   mr lester  mr masterson needs to see you   i can't see him tonight  harry  it's our night off   we have a booking elsewhere   mr masterson indicated it was rather urgent   come in  mr lester  come in   you've been here before  of course   i have  yes   i like this suite  there are even bigger suites in the hotel  but i'm fond of this one   when you've seen as many hotel rooms as i have   you get a feeling for one that fits   yes  you may have heard about my interest in gold  mr lester   keeping it close   you can think you've covered every possible eventuality   how things can go wrong  but you never have   there will always be something that comes up from behind  and tries to destroy everything one's created   no matter how powerful one's position appears to be   so one has to be prepared   i like to know i can fight back   mr masterson  i have an urgent engagement tonight   so if we could     julian will be at the club tonight  won't he   i don't know who's going to be there   we've not been given the guest list   would you just tell julian not to worry   i've completely taken care of it   and would you give him this   you will remember  won't you   i will  yes  i really must go   if you were wondering     i wasn't wondering   it's a little debt i've taken care of   you will tell him that and give him the envelope   trains rattle  where the hell have you been  something came up   give me your coat   are you mad   this is the one time you couldn't be late   why  is it that full  louis  louis  let me look at you   your royal highness  i'm so sorry i'm so late   something happened and i     please  mr lester  you're here now and that's what matters   you nearly disrupted the whole plan  louis   it's the most delightful plan   piano music starts  no  no  no  what are you doing   has no one told him  we're not starting yet   we need to be brisk  you took so long eating your pudding   i've never been to a club like this   we usually send junior staff to these sort of places   we don't even do that now   there you are  the last ones  please hurry  hurry   she's not going to stop us getting a drink  is she   bar's closed   maybe you've met his royal highness prince george before   this is mr boxley from his master's voice recording company   and mr hardiman from the bbc   your royal highness  please accept our apologies   i am most dreadfully sorry for being so late  we'd no idea     no idea at all  no   lady cremone didn't warn us  please accept my abject apologies   i  i didn't have an inkling   not an inkling  no   it's very rude to be late  i'm never late   heavy rain falls  and now it's raining  let me apologise again  sir   no  no  please  why don't we stop all these apologies  and listen to the music   that's why we're here  isn't it   don't let the rain put you off     my man's gone away    left me feeling blue    no good trying to chase him    cos he's run straight back to you    says he doesn't love you    though he sticks through thick and thin    it's bad luck for the likes of me    because i don't wear his ring  music continues  muffled    i don't know why i love him    i should quit and start again    but there's an arrow through my heart    says he ain't like other men    i got those lovelorn blues    i got those lovelorn blues     music starts again    drinking alone and i'm happy to see you    ain't right or wrong if i do or i don't    i'm holdin' on for a dance at the voodoo    crazy in the mood for love    never say you won't be leaving    you can buy me time and teasing    you can show me ways of pleasing    crazy in the mood for love    crazy in love and i'm not going to make it    this is a chance and i'm going to take it  she exhales  so far so good  i think my hands are shaking   i've never seen you nervous before  stanley   well  it is a fairly unusual audience  deirdre     i can show you ways of pleasing    crazy in the mood for love    crazy in love  crazy in love     crazy in the mood for love     marvellous  absolutely marvellous   wouldn't you agree  mr boxley and mr hardiman   yes  your royal highness   and you  mr hardiman  just right for the wireless  is it not   crowd chatter  lavinia  i think that could be counted as a triumph   let's hope so  poor little chickens  they look so mortified still   it's just like one of your cartoons come to life  isn't it  stanley   except it's a little sexier   you sang wonderfully  my dear   all those important people and they were so close   well  i'm not used to crowds either  so i am holding on tight   they laugh  ah  mr lester  it's been nice to talk to you   your royal highness   mr lester  we must get to know each other a little better   that would be an honour  your royal highness   do you mean that   of course i do  sir   well  i wonder when we can do this   i'm going to be here a little while longer yet   but then maybe we can move on to some other place of entertainment   or whatever takes one's fancy   he snorts look at those poor fellows   shall we put them out of their misery   they cannot leave until i do  that's protocol   but i think we've tortured them long enough  mr boxley  mr hardiman   you really don't need to be here a moment longer than you want to be   oh no  your royal highness  we're enjoying ourselves greatly   we've no wish to leave   yes  but i know you want to make telephone calls in private  to your superiors about tonight   shan't be a moment   you go too  go now  i'll grab another taxi   it's best to slip away before the prince gets  uh   too interested   that's unless  of course  you want that  louis   let's go to the hotel   oh  god  no  he'll probably follow you there   hang on  here's the keys to music express   there's nobody there   it's the one place in london he won't think to follow you   look at them  they won't be able to sleep for a week because of tonight   the embarrassment of it all  they're going to wake up screaming   i hope so   you know  mr hardiman has to introduce the bands sometimes  on the wireless himself  it'd be so funny if he had to do that for you   i forgot julian  i forgot to give him the message   what about julian  i have to do this  i said i would   i won't be a moment   julian  i have a message for you from mr masterson   do you  when did he give it to you   tonight  he says everything is taken care of   i think that's what he said  he did  did he   he exhales and laughs  you got   you got soaked for me   my heartfelt thanks  louis  my dear friend   all is right with the world   i knew it would be  but sometimes you never know   he laughs  heavy rain falls  everything all right   yes  let's go  let's go now   yes  before they come after us  the prince and his courtiers   crowd chatters  this is exciting  i've never been allowed in stanley's domain before   there's some terrific photographs in here   everything that's ever interested stanley is right here   this room is like being inside his brain   a toothbrush   and a vest   yes  i think this is the nearest stanley gets to a home   i don't think he has a proper house or flat at all   he sleeps here or at his mother's  or he doesn't sleep at all   and he's got my photos up   he asked me for some big copies  but i thought  he was just being polite  i didn't realise they'd be on display   you know  they slept together on the train  pamela and stanley   they didn't  i didn't know that  are you sure   yes  but i don't know what's happened since   you couldn't get two more different people  could you   and here are all the others  about to play havoc with the band   don't say that  i told you  it's all real  their enthusiasm   they absolutely love your music   and so do i   heavy rain falls  what on earth is that   it could be another earthquake  he laughs  don't laugh  there was an earthquake in london last year   it was quite bad  actually   what an incredible storm   we have to go out in that   they laugh  we can't let the chance go  we'd never forgive ourselves  come on   whoa  it feels amazing  come on  everybody   they squeal and laugh  my dear brother  always so quiet and well behaved   come on  your royal highness  you must come too   yes  come on  please  come  come   why not  he's right   it's not the sort of thing one gets the chance to do every day   there you are  royalty in a hailstorm   it's amazing being here tonight  isn't it    come on  arthur  you're next   last chance to be young   trumpet plays  what's the matter   it's just a little strange being watched by all of them   well  i could take them all down   no  you don't  they're my photographs  remember   on second thoughts  i can easily cope with them   for god's sake  stop fussing  i will survive  don't worry   why don't you sing for us  jessie   yes  that would warm us up   sing like this   yes  please  that would be nice   especially as mr lester has deserted us   well  of course  your royal highness     there was a time    i felt so low    each day was tough    it scared me    dared not believe    that i could live    life my way    when i came to  my mind was clear    said my goodbyes and shed a tear    things will never be the same again    my head up high    i came to town    and learned to love a little    a little    you showed me how to play the game    that i succeed a little    now i can dream about us    high as i can go    i'm just on top of the world       jessie   it's in the shops now  have you seen it   and you bought so many of them  mr luscombe   i just thought i'd help it along a little   not that it'll need it  of course  now  will you come for a spin     i'm on top of the world    i'm on top of the world    i'm just on top of the world     engine stops    there was a time i felt so low    each day was tough       don't laugh   but i've being imagining for a long time playing your record  for the first time in this spot  with you sitting opposite me   why would i laugh  i'd never laugh at that   good  then don't laugh at this either  you have to say yes   that car is a present  i bought it for you   mr luscombe  you didn't      but i can't drive   i'll teach you  and louis can use it too   say you'll keep it  please  say yes   yes   i like this edition  i had a feeling about this louis lester band   i always said put them on the cover  didn't i   i knew they'd become a big

interesting things   mr schlesinger   nathan  it's time you started calling me nathan  mr lester   of course  and er  do call me louis  nathan   i've just been reading another article about you  louis   this time in the melody maker   i'm going to lose count of how many there've been  i'm not   i have some good news for you   you've received another royal summons  from the prince of wales   and it is a rather surprising invitation  louis   it is to play at an raf dinner   which he's attending in his role as air marshal   he's a bit of a pilot  you know  bit of a flyer   i just wish i could come   jessie  excuse me  jessie   jessie   interesting news  the prince of wales wants us to play again   that's nice   that's nice  that's all   yes  well  he liked us before  so he'll like us again  won't he   jessie   jessie  look  something awful's happened   i had this cleaned for the prince of wales tonight  but they've made a mark on it  and it won't come out   i don't know what to do  i haven't got anything else good enough   what's the matter with you   i'm not feeling well   i'm not going to be able to sing tonight   what  you've got to  it's the prince of wales  you have to   i can't  i'm not well   you can do it instead   you know you're able to  carla   stanley  you are marvellously on time   of course i am  i'm so excited   excited by what  stanley   well  at having tea with you  of course   and seeing you here in london again   i'm here to see the opening of a play i've put money into   mr masterson's accompanying me   he's an interesting fellow  isn't he   he is indeed   and i thought i'd wish the band good luck for tonight   for their evening with the prince of wales and the royal air force   what an extraordinary occasion that's going to be   talking of which  i've brought you  the christmas edition of music express  hot off the press   thank you very much for that  a perfect present   it's tremendous what you've made happen  you know   what i've made happen   yes  for the band  the success they're having   well  it really helped that everybody was  trapped in the club by the storm   yes  but you laid that on too  didn't you   you can do anything   you flatterer   of course  i think i had something to do with it too   you most certainly have   but i couldn't have done it without you  so  thank you   i feel that my sons would have loved their music very much   you know  stanley  all my energy for seeking out new things   for discovering the next new exciting voice       is still all about me dealing with grief  really   even after 15 years  it doesn't seem to be getting any less   and obviously at christmas     one feels     i'm sorry     thank you  my dear   lavinia  here we all are to wish you a happy christmas   and of course to wave the band off on their big day   what do you mean you can't sing  i'm not well   carla can easily do all the songs instead of me   they won't notice the difference   don't be ridiculous  of course they will   this is for the prince of wales   well  i can't sing tonight  i have a fever   i have to go to bed now   where do you think you're going  jessie   i haven't finished with you yet  have you seen a doctor   they've called a doctor for me  i have a temperature   if i find out    find out what   if i find out you're going out  i'm not going out tonight   of course i'm not   if you're going out with mr luscombe or anybody else     i wouldn't do that  why would i do that   i'm ill  that's all it is   is it  you start getting a little attention  and then this happens  i'm really disappointed in you  jessie   you're disappointed in me  because i'm ill    she is ill  louis  i promise   you better be  because if i discover that you left  the hotel for a single moment tonight  if i find that out   you may not have a job with the band in the morning     mr lester   mr donaldson and his party are downstairs   and it's not that long now till the time of departure   you won't find that i've left the hotel  or even left my room   i promise you i won't  louis   why don't you take our car to the air base   have a good spin in that  and all your anger will go away   good luck  louis  i would give anything to be there too   to take pictures of you playing to all those military types   yes  well  let's hope we get away with it without jessie   you will   hey  make sure you send our love to his royal highness   i do hope they manage without jessie   yes  it's a pity she can't go  isn't it   i wondered where everybody was  nobody seemed able to tell me   i'm waiting for lady cremone   and here she is   i'm so sorry  walter  to keep you waiting   we have rather a lot of people to meet before the show tonight   off you go  walter  you mustn't be late for all your meetings   are you still going to paris  julian   i am  yes  i'm catching this evening's night train   you will telephone me when you get there   i don't know  i hope i'll have the time   i'll only be gone for three days   you won't even notice that i'm not here   did you give me the telephone number for the apartment in paris   i don't think that you did   go  walter  go   if it was a hotel  of course  i wouldn't need the number   but it isn't and i don't have the address   i'd like to take the number  if i may   don't be silly  walter  you're being absurd   come on  you have to go  off you go   i must have that number  give me the number   i have to have it   i'm sure julian will telephone you   i will get hold of the number myself and give it to you  walter   julian's always so vague about these things   and he's hopeless with numbers   what a good plan   see you in three days   long face   he's always got such a long face  sometimes it drives me mad   when you're that rich   why do you need to have such a long face all the time   engine roars  musicians this way  through here   better hurry  top brass will be arriving any moment   i'm a little afraid  louis   you will be fine  carla   well  the wireless has spread so fast  faster than anyone  could have imagined  i mean  millions more each year   so what will the next thing be   the next trend that will spread like wildfire   cinemas on trains   every train will have a cinema carriage  a movie while you move   no  no  i think with cinema  it will be in the sky   in the sky   yes  i went to a demonstration the other day  a little man   i think he was called grindle  he's going to project images onto  clouds  cinema in the sky at night hanging over the city   oh  that'd be fantastic   imagine greta garbo over the whole city  her gigantic face   or farquhar and tonk in a cartoon  jumping about over the houses of parliament   but if you could do that  somebody could also have fascists  goose stepping across the sky  that'd be pretty terrifying   clearly one would have to have a limit  you couldn't allow that   who could stop them though  people would find a way   but my point is  we have no idea what's coming next   what time's your train  darling  you don't want to miss it   er  no  i won't miss it  don't worry   in you go   give 'em hell   crowd chatter loudly  music starts    fog on a river    mist in my heart    you're not near    we're far apart    i loved you then    and i lost you    down river    four o'clock       here she is  doesn't she look beautiful   i just thought i'd say hello   that tree is so lovely   jessie  should you be out of bed   i thought one drink might make me feel better   of course it will  of course she's right   you must be feeling very unwell to miss singing to the prince of wales   i am  i don't feel well at all   your voice has gone  has it   it's quite gone  when i sing   louis loves performing in front of royalty   he can't have been very pleased   he understood   well  let's hope carla manages to bring it off     a memory    a distant memory    floats away     thank you   we're very pleased and honoured to be here playing  to your royal highness again  and to the royal air force   i've never been in an aeroplane myself   but maybe that'll change after tonight   audience laugh  music starts  would you like to dance     stars burnin' brighter    i'm on an all nighter    serenading to a tune    a pop at the bull's eye    in the celestial night sky    i'm dancing on the moon    i'm dreaming of the big time    a chance to dig a gold mine       have another one  maybe that's enough  julian   too much drink doesn't mix well with a fever   yes  i ought to go  that's best  isn't it   i need a beautiful sleep and then everything will be all right   i'll be back on my feet   let me see you to your room   they didn't arrange this between them  did they   she didn't miss the concert     to be with my brother  i certainly hope not   isn't this magical   it is  magical   so this hollywood producer  where are we seeing him tonight   he's upstairs   oh  he's in the hotel   that's all right  then   i don't need to break any rules   slow music plays  song ends  another slow number  please   i do find the slow ones the best  don't you   music starts  she'll be in his bed tonight   of course she will   it's what's expected  if you catch his eye  that's what has to happen   doesn't matter who you're married to   looks like your music's really helping   i may have something to eat   you'll miss your train  julian   maybe that's for the best  it's meant to happen   disappoint my friends in paris  make walter even more angry   maybe i'm good for absolutely nothing   don't be ridiculous  go and get your train right now   i'm gone   pamela  what's the matter  darling   my little brother     when he's like this      i'm sorry   excuse me   i worry about him so much  he's so young  so young for his age   i can't be there for him all the time  i just can't   and when i'm not  i can't stop thinking     he could be so brilliant if he wanted  do so much       but something always stops him   he can look after himself  i'm sure   i'm certain he can   do you think   i do hope you're right  stanley   please be right   i know i'm right  he'll be fine   of course he will   you want to take a bit home   it's pretty disgusting cake   funny  our esteemed guests and their friends can't tell the difference   i think it's lovely   you can have a plane  want a little aeroplane   no  thanks   the real ones aren't much bigger   but it's all we've got to take on germany or the french   or whoever we fight next   and everybody thinks they're absolutely marvellous   they're all we need  they don't look like much   they're fucking useless   i think i need to go  if you don't mind   i don't mind  louis  you go  i'm so happy   choir sings  o come all ye faithful   if i wasn't so drunk  i'd go and join in   the imperial christmas concert  not to be missed  apparently   all of the dowagers staying up really late for a singsong   oh yes  the duchess of northampton singing  once in royal david's city is an absolute highlight   does it every year   some things never change   engine roars  singing in the distance  louis  i'm just off  my dear friend  got to run   must have missed the train  but i'm still going to paris   we'll see each other soon   jessie   jessie     jessie   weak moaning  jessie   help   alarm sounds  help   help   an ambulance is coming   louis
