bought a house  in the local area and i'm having a house warming party  to which i'll be inviting a lot of the local adults     hence the crisps    yeah   i'll also probably need some     alcohol as

hello  is that mrs mackenzie  william's mother   right  can i just check something with you   when we're with the caravan club  there's this bird and her sister who i've shagged for two years   sometimes i get them to strum themselves while i watch   sorry  did you say you go on holiday in a caravan     with the caravan club    in a caravan like a gypo   if my mum told me we were going caravanning  i'd call childline   it's a sense of freedom you don't get with other holidays   it's a sense of shitting in a bucket in a cupboard  you don't get with other holidays  in england  with your parents   actually  it's a well known fact  that the caravan club is like a sex club all over europe   which is why i've lost my cherry and none of you sad acts have     i could have got laid loads    no  you couldn't   yeah  i could  but i want to lose it with someone i love   what  like carli   maybe i do love carli   she's gorgeous  she's smart  she's amazing   worth mentioning to her then  mate     if that's the way you feel    yeah  why not mention it   worse that can happen you get nothing   best that can happen  you get stinky fingers   you really are  one of the most disgusting humans i've ever met   look out   prince harry's had a few drinks and now he thinks he's hard     i am hard    scared of teachers  and brown nosing everyone's parents is just an act     i don't brown nose anyone    you do a bit     good manners cost nothing    a good shag costs nothing   a good shag with carli     carli's fanny on your face  on your face      carli's fanny on your face     i keep catching myself on it  it's a bloody menace   hang on  i think someone's in     and your bell end      carli's fanny on your face  on your face       neil  what the hell is going on   this place smells like a brewery and not a nice one   jay  there is always trouble when you're around   but will  i'm especially surprised at you    so sorry  steve   oh  piss off   what   don't talk to me like that in my own house   oh  i'm so sorry  my manners  piss off  please     i've had enough of your lip    you'd like my lip  wouldn't you   right round your bell end  if mr chippy doesn't get there first   what's he knocking up   a closet for you to hide in  you bumder   in hindsight  i might have taken it a bit too far   amazing   jesus christ   bumder     fair play to you  that was pretty special    bumder    it's a mixture of  bummer  and  bender    he'll be all right about it  though   he can take a joke     that was taken as a joke     my lips around your bell end      yeah  it should be fine    i love carli   i love carli   shit  i've got to tell her  what if she feels the same     seems fairly unlikely    life is about these moments   it's the things you don't do you regret   it's the cavalier philosophy that caused my father to leave my mother     you go for it    bumder   and so we headed for carli's house   i feel a bit stupid doing this  this is fine  isn't it   yeah  definitely   you would tell me if i was being a dick     of course i would    yeah  yeah   writing her surname is particularly important   it's her drive  but you wouldn't want carli based confusion   if you put a kiss  she'll suck you off     what the fuck is that    what   simon  why are you vandalising my drive   what does it say  you love me   look   i can easily wash it off  and we can just pretend it never happened  and i could not tell anyone and you could not tell anyone  and my mates could not tell anyone and your mates could not tell anyone   simon  we've known each other for ages  why now   we were playing dares   did someone dare you to be the world's biggest saddo   so what  you are in love with me   this couldn't have gone any better   actually i think this is pretty cool  simon   sort of artistic  it's like banksy or someone   why don't you come over to mine tonight  i'm baby sitting my brother     and we can sort this out    really   yeah  come round about eight  my folks will be out by then   best to avoid them until this has washed away     i'm not sure this washes away      whatever  see you later   yes   incredibly  i think you might be in there   of course he is  she's wet for you  mate   i can't believe it worked   maybe  she was impressed by your artistic side     no  it's because you're drunk    do you think so   yes  it's because you're wasted  like pete doherty  girls love it     i think pete doherty is on heroin    i'm not sure i should do heroin   right  vodka  whisky  and a load of creme de menthe   when she sees you  she'll be frothing at the gash     are you sure my dad won't notice    no  he'll never tell   he might as his whisky now tastes of apple juice   it'll be worth it     what's that    fuck off     what have you got there    and again  fuck off     you are in such shit    that's a hat trick  fuck off   mum knows you bunked off   and also everyone knows that you love carli d'amato     i don't love her  actually    everyone knows  you spaz   you wrote it on the pavement outside her house   even the year 11s were laughing about how sad you are   yeah  how sad is a date at her house tonight   you're such a sad     no  you're the sad because    twat     you're such a little fuckshit    he's made you look a right nob     when are you going to make the move    i don't know     i've got to get the kid out the way    i could come and look after him   i'll take care of the kid while you take care of the     business   business     i think i'd better take will    fine  your funeral   jay was wrong  it wouldn't be a funeral   but it would be as much fun as one   so that evening   we arrived at the house of the girl simon had always loved  and we were drunk  so very drunk     hi    hi     hello  there    hello  william   you coming in then  simon   are you his chaperone   no  babes  he's gonna watch the kid while we chat  about  you know  our feelings     best not to call me babes though    really   really   come on in then  chris is watching tv  will   come on  you  let's get a drink   so dad went totally ballistic about the driveway   i think you're still invited over for christmas  but he's gonna make your parents pay for an industrial stone cleaner     it was worth it    can you smell bleach     what are you watching    don't know     i think there's been a big bomb    really   oh  it's one of those recreations of a dirty bomb   what's a dirty bomb   it's just a big nuclear bomb  that terrorists would use to kill everyone in london   have you been drinking spirits   sorry

take me like this  well i'm sorry  babes   but this is the package   there goes the tallest building in london   that'll be a few thousand dead   my mum and dad are in london tonight  would they be killed   not only killed but obliterated   merely a scorched shadow on the pavement   dust     so they are dead forever    yes  dead forever   my mummy   my daddy   come on  carli   you know why i'm here   and i know why i'm here   and you know why i'm here     kiss me    you know i've got a boyfriend     just finger yourself in front of me    jesus  simon   they do it in caravan club  come on  i

him about terrorists and stuff   you were telling a seven year old about terrorists   he won't sleep for a week now  you idiot   have you unblocked the sink yet  all the lumps   i am really sorry   i think maybe i ate something   could we maybe sit down and talk about us   have you got any nurofen  it's just     oh dear   i think we'll be off now   right  i think we'd better get you back to mine and cleaned up   oh  god  my head   i've ruined it   i love her and i've ruined it with her  oh  god   she's so amazing   i'm going to say this to you as a friend   shut up   today's been a fuck up from start to finish   we need to write it off  ok  today's gone   it isn't going to get any worse   oh  shit  isn't that your mum's car   and that's neil's dad's car   oh  shit   oh  shit   well  it's every wednesday and we play sort of  i suppose   best of three games  the changing facilities are not too bad     yeah  yeah    all in all  it's a good thing   right  sit down  you two   sometimes in life you have to sit down   take your punishment like a man   unfortunately  this was not one of those times   you've had quite a day off   you've lied to your mothers  bought alcohol illegally   abused neil's dad  stole my suit   defaced the pavement outside carli's  am i missing anything   we also hit a spastic with a frisbee     i feel totally let down  william    it wasn't our fault  mum   i said to kevin here  i thought i brought you up better than that     it isn't our fault    why's it not your fault then   it all happened because he touched us     what    me   he touched us here   and here   and here     the bumhole    you evil little shits   i'll deal with this  kevin   now listen to me  you two  that is an extraordinary allegation   you should think carefully before you repeat it     just cos kevin's gay doesn't mean      no  i'm not gay     we're all friends  it doesn't matter    i'm not gay  i was married for       oscar wilde was married    that is enough     although  he is right  kevin      i'm not gay   all right  don't have a hissy fit   just because kevin is gay doesn't make him automatically a paedophile   i'm not a paedophile   if you want to repeat those allegations   we'll take them seriously   but if you want to tell us the truth  that it never happened  we'll move on to the other things    you're in trouble for    ok   the truth is    we're alcoholics   you have to help us  all we can think about  is where the next drink is gonna come from   we're literally out of control  today we even talked about heroin   there's a long road ahead of us  but with your support  and your love  we think we can make it   so please  as our parents   help us   and so we were so pathetic   even my mum  who has no sense of humour  was laughing at us     hello  you look well    thanks  how's your mum   not happy   but fit like a prostitute  how's your dad   really not happy  but at least he's not bent like neil's   what   shit  si  you don't look well  mate   what happened   he was up all night fucking carli's brains out   not quite   obvioulsy  by  not quite   he means he puked on her brother's head  then accused neil's dad of being a paedophile   you dickhead   what a knob     my dad's not a paedo    now  boys   good of you to join us today     oh  shit    shit indeed   now  boys  you are in the sixth form   so actually you're under no legal obligation to attend school   sutherland  cartwright   if you want to piss away your chance of gaining some qualifications  and improving your lives  then be my guest   i still get paid at the end of the week     really  oh  great    brilliant  thanks  sir   i knew no day could go as badly as yesterday did   however  cooper  mackenzie   phoning the school and pretending to be your parents   that  my little friends  is fraud   i think we'd better go and see the head   they say it's the things you don't do in life that you regret   well that's clearly not true   i regret hitting that girl with a frisbee   and i regret hurling insults at neil's dad   bumder   and i'm pretty certain simon regrets almost everything he did that day   oh  dear   but they also say all's well that ends well   hang on  this didn't even end well   transcript  evarin   synchro  tagne
