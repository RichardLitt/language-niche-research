  what are you doing here  nobody's died   i know  you'll be missing your targets   no  this is a social call  i'm having a party   it's a   special sort of birthday   think of a number  then forget about it immediately   thank you   oh  if you'd like to bring anybody     i haven't really got anybody   you could always bring the dishy sgt hathaway   hathaway  dishy   crowd    happy birthday dear

considering  considering   yeah  considering  considering   well  i'm out of practice with parties and such   and it's louder than i expected   they were all medical students once upon a time   a few glasses of this  and they revert   hey  do you play cards   a bit of cribbage with my grand dad years ago   but just for matches   but just for matches   some of the guys are organising a late night poker session   some of the guys are organising a late night poker session   probably not for matches  not my scene   where's james  i have no idea   where's james  i have no idea   ah  thought so   didn't fancy being scowled at by a room full of doctors and nurses   bad enough with civilians   are you having a good time   as they say  you've heard one joke about gallstones   you've heard them all   they're planning a poker school indoors   play poker  no   i play chess   why doesn't that surprise me   i suppose what i'm really thinking is    what time can i decently get up and leave    we could invent an emergency call   police siren  maybe there is a god   if i was sure about that i wouldn't have joined the police force   sounds quite serious   come on   inspector lewis   we thought you might need backup  we didn't ask for any   no  nobody there  evening  sir  evening   who made the call  chap who lives here   name of stringer  some sort of professor  by the looks of it   lots of books  reported seeing an intruder in the garden   that's 'im   i think he might appreciate the reassurance of a senior officer   you can try asking 'im  don't go anywhere   we need a lift back to town  there's a surprise   detective inspector lewis   i simply reported an intruder in my garden   i wasn't expecting a four power conference   coincidence   we were at a party over there  dr hobson's   yes  i know dr hobson   though  not well enough to be invited to her party   loud cheers mercifully   doctors   two glasses of champagne  they revert to being students again   this intruder  if he were to find his way in   is there anything worth stealing   there are some first editions  which are probably quite valuable   though  i can't imagine the average burglar knowing to steal them   and then selling them off down the pub   i suppose if such a burglar existed  we'd find him in oxford   but you saw an intruder   i heard the neighbour's dog barking   ah  dogs  it's what they do best   i looked out of the window and saw   or i thought i saw  somebody in the garden   due to the number of burglaries  due to the number of burglaries lately  i called the police   as recommended by the leaflets from neighbourhood watch   though  i think i was putting my faith in the deterrent effect  of the flashing blue lights   seems to have worked   could it be personal   you'll have to explain   you'll have to explain   if  as you say  there's nothing of obvious street value    i think the sergeant's wondering whether you might have enemies   i teach english literature   my speciality is the romantic poets of the early 19th century   my speciality is the romantic poets of the early 19th century   keats  shelley  byron     rest of the guys in the band   among others   it's not a profession which tends  it's not a profession which tends to attract violent enemies   now  would i be right in thinking we have exhausted this discussion   i think so  don't you  sergeant   i think so  don't you  sergeant   unquestionably   laura  hi   listen  sorry to be party poopers  but something's come up   listen  sorry to be party poopers  but something's come up   taxi   taxi   if i'd wanted to be a cab driver   you'd need latin  sir   sir  i'll call you tomorrow  ok    soon  these burning miseries will be extinct   i shall ascend my funeral pyre triumphantly   and exalt in the ag    agony of the torturing flames   the light of that conflagration will fade away   my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds   for my spirit    for god's sake  is there much more of this   it's good  isn't it   speaking as the english student  i think it's terminally naff   speaking as a mathematician  i agree   man  but you read quadratic equations for fun   man  no  he doesn't   he reads the starting prices from newmarket   gonna let me finish  i think we should vote   i second that   i'd rather you told us about tolkien playing the banjo   dink  dink  dink  dink    woman  it was here last november  that a fully grown crocodile was spotted   photographs appeared in the press  items on the national news   although the creature was never caught   there were reports that two dogs disappeared without a trace  at the time   as well as a prize winning siamese cat   belonging to a professor of biochemistry   philip has some photographs of this crocodile   which make very attractive and rather unusual postcards   available at a nominal charge  as a lasting souvenir  of the secret oxford they would rather you didn't know about   and that concludes our tour   thank you for being such a lovely audience   you're a credit to charles darwin   might i have a word  about the crocodile   golly gosh  formidable police presence   hand on heart  i was just passing   and i much enjoyed the bit of your tour that i saw   but there have been complaints   we can't give people their money back   it's a free service  who's been complaining   tourist office say you tell people a pack of lies   well   lies are more fun than the truth  don't you think   politicians lie all the time  you don't follow them  do you   but if you want to arrest a poor  struggling art student   then now's your moment  i'll come quietly   art student  so  this is all art   naturally  i mean  everything that matters is art   if we gave you a free postcard  would that count as a bribe   absolutely   give us a free postcard  philip   give the nice policeman a postcard   i need a word with the dynamic duo   would that be us  ma'am  it would   the desk had a complaint about you two  from   a man named stringer   dr stringer  lecturer in english literature   the same  he said you turned up on his doorstep uninvited   and that you were both drunk and facetious   we'd been drinking at dr hobson's party   but we were not drunk   and   i don't understand facetious   something to do with dogs barking and romantic poets   that would be me  i referred to keats  byron and shelly  as  the guys in the band    fairly harmless jest  i would have thought   to an oxford academic  that is facetious   i don't even want to know about the barking dogs   we promise not to do it again  good   you see  the principle behind a partnership such as yours  is that the junior officer matures to the level of the senior   rather than that the senior officer should regress   i'll bear it in mind   was it a good party   compared with what  serves me right for asking    facetious    all that and  dishy   too   you see  i got the names right   if you get names right  you get away with murder   mobile phone  hathaway   and they said  a suspicious death   there are over six million items in the library   books  manuscripts and related material   they're stored across several acres   on several floors   anything you order at the front desk  is with you within the hour   tell me about the dead man   mr chapman  yes  he works here    worked here   as a senior maintenance engineer   they found him in the basement stacks   through there  thank you   jim   ma'am   we need to know who had access to this area   anyone that works down here   we wouldn't have found it without a guide   hi  he was er  shot at close range   with  a small calibre handgun   one of those pretty little design accessory weapons  that dealers like to carry   it's not the sort of place to lie in wait on the off chance  is it   any sign of a struggle  some bruising to the face   as if he's been in a fight  but probably not today   you realise what we've got  don't you  sir  what   a body in the library   now  that is definitely facetious   yes  that's reg   thanks  mrs chapman   cup of tea  a chat   and then we'll find you a car to take you home  all right   it's amazing   what is   they just found a dead body at the bodleian   a body at the bodleian    i weep for adonais   he is dead   i weep for adonais   though my tears thaw not the frost  which binds so dear a head    what's that  your main man   shelley  he's writing about death   hm   hm   i like him better when he writes about   kissing   you know   the moonbeams kiss the sea     that bit   death   kissing  they're all parts of the same thing   sort of  heads and tails   oh  we've gotta go to work  come on   do as you're told  i always do as i'm told   woman  come back here  you little tykes   sorry about the house  we used to have a lovely house   then he lost his job  which job   his proper job  he was an engineer at the car factory   then it all went belly up   i think that's what hurt him most    i'm a skilled man   he'd say   and look at me now   doing odd jobs for a bunch of librarians    librarians seemed happy enough with his work   he could do it in his sleep   so  it didn't help with the problem  problem   has nobody told you yet  no  not yet  what problem   his gambling  oh  he's a gambler   oh  he could bet on anything   horses  dogs  football   flies crawling up a window   except  you don't really see flies any more  do you   wonder where all the flies have gone  funny that   tell me about his gambling   it cost him his job  his proper job   cost us our home  our proper home   and  any day now  it was going to cost him his marriage   who's the reader  reg   he said  working in the library  he got interested in old books   he said they were beautifully made  he liked beautiful things   he said no one knew how to make things any more   you're not really supposed to take things from the bodleian   he always returned them  would you like me to return them   i'm past caring   well  thank you  i'll let myself out   it was here in this public house   in the late 1940s   that jrr tolkien  author of the lord of the rings   played the banjo in a traditional jazz band called  the thames valley cotton pickers   now  although none of this is actually stated  in any of the official biographies  there are still people in oxford  who will remember the great man   after a couple of pints of locally brewed beer   giving a sensational performance of  i wish i could shimmy like my sister kate   now if you could all follow the parasol   it was here  under this very bridge   that the famous russian spies   guy burgess   kim  philby and donald mclean   would gather to plot the overthrow of the royal family  and british parliamentary democracy  american  i have a question   i'm here to help  weren't those guys at cambridge   exactly  the cambridge spies   and what better way to er  cover their tracks  than to hold their clandestine meetings here in oxford   now we're going to go down to the crocodile infested river   suppose i say i don't believe a word of any of this stuff   but there are photographs of the crocodile   and i would say to you  sir   do you believe that all men and women are created equally   with inalienable rights   such as life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness   i hold those to be self evident truths   it's easier to believe a crocodile swims in the cherwell   she's quite extraordinary  isn't she   indeed  she is   seems to be impressing our american friend   americans impress easily   yeah  he had a fiver on each   this one finished fourth  the other a non runner   so  at least he gets half his money back   he doesn't  i'm afraid  why not   he's dead  these were in his pocket  what happened   seems he was murdered   wow   did you take those bets  no  that was me   sorry  i couldn't help overhearing   what happened  you are   eric jameson  he's our resident genius   second year maths  working my way through college   you knew mr chapman  same as any of the regulars   you know them and you don't  how did he seem this morning   same as usual  never much to say  just placed his bets and left   he never hung around  but er     well  he was officially at work   and i shouldn't really be here  i've got a seminar   yeah  off you go   is that all right   i never stand in the way of scholarship   see you in the morning   mr chapman was heavily in debt  can you shed any light on that   he didn't owe us any money  do you allow credit betting   with people like reg  it was strictly cash   we're like banks   we only lend money to people who don't really need it   you seeing his family  will be seeing his wife  yeah   well  we owe her a fiver for the non runner   we can arrange for a policewoman to come home with you   help with the children   no need  we'll probably go to my brother's   tell me about your brother   mick  mick jeffreys  works in the building trade   solid as a rock   him and his wife have been on at me about leaving reg for ages   did your husband ever get counselling for his gambling   yes  i think he did   do you know who he saw   no  it's anonymous  isn't it   like alcoholics  a sort of secret society   sort of worked for a bit   it was all ups and downs   one minute there'd be no money  then there'd be money  and     then it was back to square one   it got quite good about a month ago   but that could be because he'd had a couple of winners   did he ever get into fights   came home saturday night with a bruise over his eye   but i didn't dare ask him about it  where had he been   dogs  probably  can i go now   we'll organise you a car   mrs chapman  i've got something for you   it's from the bookmakers   apparently  your husband backed a horse and    and won   just like him to back a winner today   it's a non runner  actually   so  the money's returned   it's only five pounds  but     may only be five pounds to you   stringer  i was somewhat alarmed to see so many of you  insist on referring to the writers' intentions   when grappling with the mysteries of the great romantic poets   you're not in the sixth form now   you're supposed to be grown up and mature   so  let us spell this out   keats  shelley  byron  coleridge   and the rest of  what a passing stranger recently called    the guys in the band   generally had no idea what their intentions were   they were too intoxicated   with drink  with drugs  with love   with their own vanity   even after writing their poems  they had no clear idea   which  happily  gives me something to teach   and you something to learn  mobile phone message alert  hands up  who is the guilty party   i think it might be you   mea culpa   you will be happy to know that this is a message written in clear   grammatical     unambiguous english   intentions made clear   perfectly   because this is a message not from a poet or an artist       but from a mathematician   now  where were we   here are details of all the people who work in the library   full time  part time and temporary   well  i did ask  thank you   tell me about the security here   you've got more than six million books  original manuscripts   all that lot must be worth a fortune  yes   their price is beyond rubies   and if i tell you our security system   you probably won't believe me  try me   everyone who joins the bodleian has to read out loud        i hereby undertake not to remove from the library   or to mark  injure or deface in any way   any volume  document  or other object belonging to it   or in its custody   not to bring into the library  or kindle therein   any fire or flame  and not to smoke in the library   and i promise to obey all the rules of the library    sounds like my old wolf cub promise   does it work   yes  it does  as a matter of fact   we lose far fewer items than any other library in the country   there's no mention of murder   fair point  but it is the first one in 500 years   and we did discover these at chapman's house   ah   hm  that's interesting   are they valuable  they're quite old  early 1800s   but old age in itself doesn't necessarily make things valuable   the older i get  the more i realise that   no  it's just  if his gambling debts were as large as you tell me   then these wouldn't scratch the surface   but i'll check with the experts  and get back to you with figures   how easy or difficult is it to check  whether something's gone missing   er  not impossible  but time consuming   we'll do our best   ok  here's one last teaser for you   we're in the final of a darts tournament   player a needs 117   which  you'll work out in a trice   means a finish of treble 19  a single 20 and a double 20   player b needs 83   where the standard finish is treble 17 and double 16   however  player a has a career success rate of 80    player b has a career success rate of 65    and this time next week  you'll tell me who will win   and what odds the bookmaker should offer on the result   well  if it was easy  you'd all be at reading or keele   that's all  folks   eric  could you spare a minute   yeah  sure  see you later   i've been looking into this bloke  the brother in law   put pressure on mrs chapman to walk out on the marriage   a bit of form  he likes to get drunk and beat people up   has he ever shot anyone   i'm sure he'll tell us   hm   did you get on with your brother in law  mr jeffreys   look  if a bloke wants to screw up his own life  that's one thing   when it's his wife and kid's  that's something else   when the wife is your sister  got it in one   have you ever hit him   depends on what you mean by  hit    as in the last time you were up in court for it   listen  that's all on the record   i've paid my fines  done my community service   the full rehabilitation  check it   and reg chapman   saturday night     i gave him a couple of slaps outside the dog track   why  why    cos he promised my sister he'd stop going  and there he was   and where were you earlier today   here  witnesses   that roof  weren't here yesterday  it's there now   a roof as a witness  that's a first   listen  i'm on a bonus deal here   if i was gonna kill anybody  i'd do it in my own time   all i did was yell at the guy at regular intervals   i even suggested he get counselling   let me put it this way   if i have a friend who has a gambling problem   and i come to you for help   what is the first thing that would happen   patrons cheer  yeah  i understand about confidentiality   but it's a murder inquiry  so it takes priority   a name  address and phone number would be deeply appreciated   hang on a minute  let me write this down   she's a professor of mathematics  apparently   with a gambling problem   i don't know whether that's a qualification   isn't that how alcoholics work   we'll be big and grown up  and ask   we're hoping you can tell us something about gamblers anonymous   try me  er  please  sit down   well  for a start  where do you fit in   well  if someone has a problem   and he or she rings the number in the phonebook   then i'm the one who's the initial point of contact   so  do you have  or used to have  a gambling problem   i gamble  but i don't have a problem   what sort of gambling  i play bridge   for high stakes  sometimes   but i usually win  so that does somewhat minimise the risk   i suppose it would   but if you usually win  how did you get involved with the organisation   a friend of mine did have a problem  and i tried to help him   and once i'd dealt into the game  i found it difficult to walk away   it's fascinating  and  no point in being coy   it relates to my academic work  i specialise in probability theory   how to beat the bank   that's one way of putting it   we're investigating the death of a man called chapman   we know he had gambling problems   we think he might have come to you for help   well  let me check   reginald chapman  is that the man  yeah   i can confirm he came to us  and what happened then   he attended group sessions  and we gave him a mentor   somebody he could go to if he was in trouble   could you give us a name  i need to ask his permission   yeah  well  if you could speak to him   let us have his name by the end of the afternoon   it shall be done  anything else   i have a facetious question   which is  where'd you get the necklace   ah  it is rather fun  don't you think   she's a student  nell buckley   makes jewellery out of bits of recycled rubbish   call it my meaningful gesture towards saving the planet   and will we do it  do you think  save the planet   applying your laws of probability   i think it's on a par with beating the bank   another academic nutcase   you're reading my mind  i know   ring tone  stringer   sorry  i'm not available to answer the phone   if you'd like to leave a message  please do so after the tone    hi  it's me   would you give me a call when you've got a moment   fairly quickly  for preference  it's about reg chapman   love you   inspector lewis  it's naomi norris   we seem to have turned up something rather interesting  about the books that reg chapman took home   yes  half an hour is fine   bye   mobile phone  yeah   i'll see you there   what's the story  guy out jogging along the towpath  saw the body and called up on his mobile   any identification  yeah  a students union card   seems to be called nell buckley   that rings a bell  she had this in her pocket    and the sunlight clasps the earth   and the moonbeams kiss the sea   what are all these kissings worth if thou kiss not me    shelley   one of  the boys in the band   yeah  he was a student at oxford   then got sent down for having an affair with a married woman   sounds like every student's favourite role model   oh  god  what   oh  god  what   well  i met her   just the other day  she was running guided tours  that were a pack of lies  she was lovely   sorry to keep you waiting  do you know who she is   an art student  nell buckley   i don't know what i hope to find  come again   students have an above average tendency to commit suicide   especially when there's a convenient river   i never met anybody less likely to commit suicide   you don't smack yourself in the back of the head  before you throw yourself in the river  either   quite so   she bribed me with a postcard of a crocodile   yeah  that's her   mm   we were just putting up a new exhibition of student work   i'm no expert  but this is very good  isn't it   yes  philip is quite remarkable   philip   er  philip horton   he's something of a throwback   you'll have to explain that   well  this art school  by a long tradition   has always focussed on the more academic  old fashioned virtues  of drawing and painting   obviously  that's all changed now   it's a very broad church  as you can see   yeah  i can see   but when philip turned up   he reminded us of what was said about claude monet    he's only an eye  but what an eye    obsessed with setting down what he sees in front of him   no more  no less   surprised he wasn't there   where  where you found nell  by the river   they'd sit there for hours painting the sky and the water   are you saying they'd go there together   oh  most days  yeah  where might we find philip today   well  if he's not by the river   you'll probably find him in the ashmolean   he stares at turner and constable   trying to figure out how they did it   thank you   philip horton  mm   constable   he wanted to get better at painting clouds   so he went out day after day painting clouds   you see  that's the way the clouds looked on that day   they never looked like that before  and they never will again   i think that's amazing   nothing is ever the same again   we're told nell buckley is a friend of yours   i think so  yes   girlfriend  huh  you might say   are you not with her today  no   we had a row   would you like to come with us  tell us about this row   i gave you a postcard  you're the policeman   yes  i'm the policeman  mm   come tell us about the row   all right   now  philip  do you understand why we need to talk to you   not really  but it's interesting   i never talked to a policeman before   apart from the other day  so that's twice in a week   is it all right if i erm    it's fine   the thing is  we're hoping you might be able to help us  with some enquiries we're making about nell buckley   you should ask nell about nell  she'd know   you said you had a row  what was that about   same thing as usual   art   well  if you told us what the argument was about   do you think we'd understand   we argue about what it is   and what is it  nobody knows  it's why we argue   see  i can't do what she can do  and she can't do what i can do   what can she do   she's really good at making up amazing things   like crocodiles in rivers   yeah  amazing things like that   i can't do that   what can you do that she can't do   well       that   that's terrific   you can have that  if you like   are you sure   i can easily do another now i know what you look like   mobile phone oh  excuse me   yeah  speaking   would you like me to do one of you   yeah  please  is it all right if i move   really doesn't make any difference   the girl's parents  the girl's parents are at the hospital   and i need to talk to dr hobson  so     i'll talk to our young genius  see where he was this morning   i wish you luck   have you always been good at drawing   i suppose so  it's fairly easy   faces are easier to draw than clouds or water   because they stay still   did you go down to the river today   nell told me to meet her at ten   i got there at 09 37  she wasn't there   she still wasn't there at ten  so i went to the gallery   does she sometimes not turn up   always forgetting things   i remember things   was nell your girlfriend   was   before the row   some people would say so   do you live together   we live in the same house with some other people   who else lives in the house   james coupland  reading history  jane evans  reading english   charles williamson  reading ppe  eric jameson reading mathematics   would you like me to draw them  no  you're all right   just tell me what you did this morning   got up at 08 22  washed my hands and face and cleaned my teeth   i went downstairs and i boiled the kettle  and had an egg   at quarter to nine i went back upstairs     yeah  hi  it's me   have you seen the local newspaper   yeah  well  the question is  should i be concerned   yes  yes  i would like to be reassured   thank you   you see  he drew that in about 60 seconds   it was as if he didn't need to look at me  just one glance   i'm not a psychoanalyst   i wasn't gonna quote you in evidence   just wanted a friendly opinion   could the lad be     i don't know  autistic  is that the word   i only what i've seen on tv documentaries  that i wasn't watching properly   the trouble is  these words are dangerous   autism  dyslexia  bipolarity  schizophrenia   we throw people into those boxes  and we kid ourselves  that we've explained everything and solved the problem   and we've done neither   am i allowed to say he's a bit weird   or do i have to say     i don't know   differently normal    no  you can say anything you like to me   that's something these days   listen  the boy's obviously got exceptional skills   he can see things and reproduce them with no apparent effort   you could argue that all artists are abnormal in that respect   same way a musician can listen to an entire symphony orchestra   and hear the one instrument that plays a wrong note   he reckons he's no good at ideas  that may well be true   he may have trouble making connections   joining the dots to make sense of his world   or it's possible that all his life  people have told him he's no good at ideas   and he's ended up believing them   and would he be capable of murder   oh  i don't know   it's     unlikely  except     what     he might   he might  if someone told him to do it   have you told philip what this all about   no  i haven't   about nell buckley  philip   you wanted to know if she's my girlfriend   do you know why we're so interested in her   no   it's because she's dead   i see   i've got a key   this is our living room   we share it   erm  through that door's our kitchen   we share that  too   i'm supposed to say  would you like some tea   no  thank you   and you have a bedroom each  yes  one each   would you like to see mine   yes  please   could we borrow one of these  philip   only for a lend   it's my school work  we'll give you a receipt for it   you can have that one   we'll take very good care of it   were you here today   yes  i told mr hathaway  at 09 37 am   but nell wasn't there  so i went to look at clouds   why is she dead   we don't know  but we want to find out   i think you might be able to help us   may we look at her room now  yes   she collected stuff   so i see   what's this one   that was her explosion at balliol   she tried to blow up balliol  it was a concept   i see   and here's the famous crocodile   that one was on news at ten with trevor macdonald   sir   forensics   they like a challenge   hi  lads  girl's bedroom  ground floor  first left   don't mistake the rubbish for rubbish   it could be crucial   oh  god   is this about nell  it is   do you live here  yes   eric jameson  studying mathematics  we met at the betting shop   is philip at home   we left him painting a picture of the kitchen   how is he   sorry  silly question  why is it a silly question   i've lived in the same house as him for a year   he's amazing  but i never have a clue what he's thinking   how would you describe his relationship with nell buckley   well   weird   seriously weird   she bossed him around   and he did as she told him  like a little puppy dog   except  dogs know how to live  don't they  philip doesn't   it's like he was born without a book of instructions   you didn't get on with him  philip   you can  sort of  tolerate him   but nell  we all loved her   philip won't let you get near enough   but nell was just       fabulous   we'll be back later to talk to everybody   but we're here if you need us   we need to get to the bodleian   i've been keeping them hanging on all day   no  don't worry  i can understand that a body in the river  takes priority over a couple of old books   these are the books you found at reg chapman's house   now  when we checked  we discovered that  some of the end papers have been removed   you see   the blank pages you find at either end of most books   why would anyone do that   well  one possible explanation is that they were used  to make forgeries from the period in question   in this case  the early 1800s  and these   well  we did a little spot check on the period   and these turned up   love's philosophy and a dream of the unknown   they're both by shelley    and the sunlight clasps the earth   and the moonbeams kiss the sea      how can you tell they're forgeries  they look good to me   well  i can't tell personally  but this is oxford   there's a shelley scholar on every street corner   and you can do scientific analysis on the paper and so on   expensive and time consuming   and science only proves what an expert authority can spot   using instinct and experience   so  that's what we did  we called in an expert   somebody steals the originals  sells them   and replaces them with a forgery  we imagine that's what happened   and how much would these originals be worth   ooh  20  30 thousand pounds a time   who buys them   someone with too much money  and too much vanity   who was your expert  we might need one ourselves   dr stringer  he lectures in english literature   this looks promising   yeah  that's it  isn't it   medical evidence is that nell was banged on the head  and dropped in the river early this morning   our young  born again claude monet  admits that he was here at 09 37  but says that nell wasn't   do we believe him  he's very precise about everything   i could tell you in great detail what he had for breakfast   obsessive neurotic   quite possibly autistic  something along those lines   maybe he's sick of carrying out her orders   or old fashioned jealousy  if she's seeing someone else   one of the other students in the house   i don't buy him as a jealous lover  he doesn't feel emotion  quite the way that other people do   it could be rage and frustration   she has all the ideas  he can't even manage one   my best offer's a definite maybe   all right  let's try coming in a different door   we've got two murders  reg chapman and nell buckley   is there a link   yes   that's decisive  what is the link  shelley   mobile phone  hello   oh  thanks for calling back     goodbye   another link  make my day   professor walters  who works for gamblers anonymous   she says that reg chapman's mentor was dr stringer   that bloke gets everywhere   dr stringer  inspector lewis   do come in   mea maxima culpa   four   five years ago       i developed a serious gambling habit   addiction  to be precise   cost me my marriage   i sought help a little too late in the day  admittedly   what kind of gambling  cards   poker   but then a good friend weaned me off it   and i started playing bridge  which is rather less lethal   it's quite quite a leap  isn't it  from studying romantic poets  to playing high stakes poker   well  superficially  yes   but erm    i've talked about this a lot in group sessions   you wouldn't believe how we all go on about our problems   and i think i was looking for some kind of  risk taking in my life that i wasn't finding in my work   and  of course  the poets in question  keats  shelley  coleridge   and the rest of  the guys in the band    to use your striking phrase   they all believed in living dangerously   tell us about reg chapman   gamblers and reformed gamblers  try to support each other   i'd survived it  come through the other side   if chapman was in trouble  he would come to me for support   that was the theory  did it work   i'm afraid not  he was too far gone   i saw my role as lending him support   he saw my role as lending him money   did you lend him money   you don't lend money to men like chapman   you give it to them  and you never see it again   while we're in confessional mode   that night when i called the police   i'm pretty sure it was chapman who was in my garden   wanting to borrow money  yes   couldn't he just knock at the front door   i think he'd moved beyond that stage   he'd gone over the edge   i was genuinely concerned for my safety   could his death be connected to the forged shelley manuscripts   i gather you'd seen them   truly  i have no idea   how good are the manuscripts   well  they're good enough to fool a casual observer   they could have lain in the archives for years unnoticed   how do you feel about forgery of that kind   it's contemptible   couldn't be clearer   right  thank you for talking to us  dr stringer   is it like being an alcoholic  i'm sorry   well  i've never been either   but i'm told that you never stop being alcoholic   you're an alcoholic who's chosen not to drink   is it the same with gambling   i don't think people are that simple   we're all different  it's what makes us interesting   he's a glib sod  isn't he   one day you're gonna meet an oxford academic you like   i think i liked him better when he was being nasty    lost angel of a ruin'd paradise   she knew not 'twas her own       as with no stain she faded    like a cloud which had outswept its rain    for god's sake  phil   it's all shelley's fault   so  will you shut it   all right   nell was remarkable   but she didn't always know where to draw the line  between a genuine work of the imagination  and  well  let's be kind   a pathetic adolescent practical joke   the explosion at balliol   we saw the photograph in her room   she left an empty cardboard box on the steps of balliol   then made anonymous phone calls in a sinister foreign accent  to say there was an empty cardboard box on the steps of balliol   bomb squad moved in  they had a controlled explosion   and nell made a video of it   posted it on the net   and also submitted it as part of her coursework   and the crocodile in the river  the same   pain in the arse  but is it art  mm   this is what i wanted to show you   we had an exhibition of student work last year   and phil horton and nell buckley showed some pieces together   in fact  it was the first time we heard they were working as a team   when you say  team   do you mean romantically   or do kids not do romance any more   i'm not sure if sex came into it or not  i mean  you've met phil   you never know what he's thinking or feeling   but nell seemed to make some sort of connection   there   what am i looking at   well  this is a letter from shakespeare  to his leading actor richard burbage   complaining about his performance in hamlet   this is from walter raleigh to elizabeth i   and this is a love letter from shelley to mary godwin   before they were married  so  these are joke letters   yeah  if you look carefully  you'll see that  raleigh tells the queen not to forget the milkman's note   shakespeare has a bit of a moan about arts council grants   and shelley apologises to mary about leaving her mobile  on the northern line   did they sell any of these  no   but i'm told the english lit crowd were very impressed   i mean  apparently   phil had the handwriting off to perfection   what had she been doing recently   she said it was something big  but she wouldn't tell us what    prepare to be amazed   she told me   she might have talked to some of the other students about it   talk to her friends at the house  it's being done   we're two short   phil's probably painting the bloody river  again   and er   charles williamson   he's got a tutorial   he's grovelling for a first  will he get one   past the post and weighed in   betting shop talk  sorry  do you enjoy working there   it beats the hell out of  selling alcopops to teenagers in a wine bar   right  that's what you do   yes  it would great  except i'm allergic to puke   did nell ever have any part time work   no  she sold one or two pictures  when the students had their exhibitions   and she made jewellery  she made this   it's recycled tat  but it's  sort of  fun   it's very cheap   yeah  well  i didn't pay for it   i did her laundry   she took good money from adults who bought it   like professor walters  you've talked to professor walters   she's his prof  that's why he's gone pale   did nell ever talk about shelley   shelley  yes   she and phil used to recite his poems to us   in the early hours of the morning   and stories from frankenstein   unless we stopped them  which we usually did   i'm gonna let myself out   and there's something else i should say  say it   we all adored nell   if we were to find the guy who did this   we'd happily tear him limb from limb   how's it going   this is no 17 in a series of over  on nell's computer   it's called paint drying  can you guess what it's about   well  it might have dried by the time i get back   i've got a date  what   you don't have dates   what's this about  autism again   no  not autism   gossip about your neighbours   any particular neighbour  dr stringer   ah  the one that shopped you for being drunk and facetious   one and only  did you know he had a gambling problem   i played bridge against him at the university bridge club   they were all way too good for me   but i didn't know he had a gambling problem  no   he says it cost him his marriage   that's not what i heard  ooh  what did you hear   according to mrs collinson  who does my ironing   it was good old fashioned adultery with his bridge partner   maths professor sandra walters   you see  you are a good detective   no matter what the neighbours say   hathaway  it doesn't make sense   do you remember how evasive professor walters was  about stringer and gamblers anonymous    it's confidential   she says   i have to ask his permission  before i can share that information with you    but she's sleeping with the guy   she could have just called him and told us then   instead of which  she took 24 hours   plenty of time for them to cover their tracks about something   what's this  philip's sketchbooks   old fashioned art   a visitors' book   i'm sure that the real information is hidden away inside nell's laptop   i bet you she had some esoteric password like  tolkien's banjo    so  try it  i have   and every permutation of crocodile i can think of   i know this face   that's reg chapman's brother in law   why would he be at nell's house   joining the dots is all well and good   but suddenly there's far too many bloody dots   i'm gonna get some fresh air   can you spare me for half an hour   have you got a date   i don't have dates   would it put you off if i watch   no   i went round your house today   i think it's a nice house  mm  me too   your friends told me that you recite poetry to them  yes   do you know lots of poetry  lots   you always been good at learning things   one of the nurses in the foster home taught me  wembley cup winning teams from 1923 onwards   when you were a kid  yes   bolton wanderers  newcastle utd   sheffield utd  bolton wanderers  cardiff city  blackburn rovers    i think i'd rather hear some poetry   all right    i dreamed that  as i wandered by the way   bare winter suddenly was changed to spring   and gentle odors led my steps astray   mixed with a sound of waters murmuring      that one's about a dream   that was lovely  thank you   could never remember any poetry when i was at school  it's easy   do you just read it and know it  no   i write it and i know it   do you write it down by hand   that's how i do writing   we found a piece of paper in nell's pocket   with poetry written on it    and the moonbeams kiss the sea      yeah  that bit  did you write it   i said it one day and she said   will you write it down   and i did   do you know what a forgery is  philip   yes  it's a crime   you've never written a poem to make it look like someone else had   why  everyone would know i'd done it  and it would be a crime   yeah  it would   nell wouldn't let me do a crime   thanks for talking to me   it was nice   nell used to talk to me   but she isn't here now   certainly i visited the house   and that were   about a month ago   i can check my job sheets for you   i didn't know young leonardo had done a picture  though   what was the job   they'd had a break in  i fixed the front door  changed the locks   have a word with the landlord  bastard hasn't paid yet   oh  and er   save your time   last week i fixed the damp proof course in a convent   doesn't mean i'm planning to murder mother superior   you realise i went on that girl's little conducted tour   oxford's secret heritage trail  or whatever the hell she called it   huh  tolkien playing the banjo  cambridge spies   crocodiles in the river   was it rewarding   highly inventive  she's very smart   it's a damn shame what happened to her   we live in a veil of tears   that's very poetic  for a mathematician   at its deepest level  mathematics is poetry   you'd argue that  at the deepest level  everything's poetry   including death   yes  i probably would   nell buckley  conceptual artist  and brilliant at having ideas   girl who fooled the bomb squad   philip horton  who can draw and paint anything you set down before him   then  over here  reg chapman  the maintenance man at the bodleian   total access to all parts of the library   he brings out the originals  philip makes the copies   the boy claims nell wouldn't have let him commit a crime   she could lie  he'd have believed her   forensics found gum arabic and iron sulphate at the house   and a mortar and pestle  everything you need to make 19th century ink   and nell was apparently working on some top secret project   how did the originals get to horton  via eric jameson   he lives in the same house as philip and nell   but also works part time in reg's favourite betting shop   so  having made these forgeries   what happens next in this dream scenario   the originals are sold on the open market   and the forgeries replaced in the bodleian   a bit more complicated than that  these were found in nell's locker    forged letters from shelley to his wife mary   these letters  if they were genuine   would be the holy grail to shelley scholars the world over   and worth an absolute fortune   why's that   you know that mary shelley wrote frankenstein   i've even read it   there have been mischievous suggestions down the years  that it was all his idea   a mere man  and these letters apparently support that theory   i have to say  speaking as a woman   i am delighted that they're forgeries   hello   you all right   eric jameson not here today   nah  he called in sick  is he all right   yeah  he's fine   he's a good lad  bright as a button   hasn't been up to anything  has he  not that we're aware of   it's more about reg chapman   did you ever see him give anything to eric   maybe in a large envelope   can't say that i did   but  if he did  it'll be on video   that's what we hoped you'd say   did you find anything on the tapes   sad people placing bets  most of them losing   reg chapman delivering mysterious packages   not yet   what we really need is a full confession from eric jameson   we'll ask him  nicely   while you're in here  see if you can find any goose feathers   i thought that was a marx brothers film   you can sharpen them to make authentic quill pens   fine   sorry to interrupt   we'd like a word with eric jameson   we all would  he went out about two hours ago to get some pizzas   and we haven't seen him since   mind if we come in and wait   not at all   and then there were two  where's everybody else   philip's in his room painting another picture   and charles is at college   and eric    has disappeared without a trace   oh  god  nothing's happened to him  has it   there's no reason to think so   we would like to have a look around the house   help yourselves   you had a break in last month  how come it wasn't reported   well  they didn't take anything  often happens to student houses   usually druggies and you only report it for the insurance claim   nobody ever gets caught   we'll try and do better in future   knock at door it's open   philip  is it all right if i come in and look around   yes  it's all right   looking for goose feathers   it's in this draw   this top one  mm   philip   yes   philip  yes   do you know what this is  easy  it's a gun   anything  yes   sergeant found a gun   you've never see this before   no  positive   how did it get into your room   i don't know  give in   do you keep your room locked  i can't   why not  there's no key   philip  we'd like you to stay here for a while   that's ok  there's lots of paper  can i use it   i was hoping you might   try to think where eric jameson might have gone   we really need to talk to him about nell   understand what i mean  is it to do with nell dying   yeah  all right  i dread to think about eric   i could talk to him all day  but i wouldn't get anywhere   he only comes to life when he's drawing pictures   most of the time he's locked away in his own little world   well  does he ever pop out of his little world to kill people   supposing the girl asked him   here's a gun  go shoot that man   just to please me  it's an artistic concept    why would he then kill her   because even he can realise she's ruined his life   can you see that boy surviving five minutes in prison    and find jameson  whichever way you stack it  he's involved   i don't who you are  and how you got my number   i don't know where he is  please leave me alone   hi  it's me  i'm getting funny phone calls   you too   no  it's just a casual enquiry  our problem  thanks for your help   what's our problem  finding eric jameson   hasn't been to college  or in touch with the betting shop   his parents are in verona listening to operas   i've been watching highlights of nell's magical mystery tour    what better way to cover tracks  than to hold their clandestine meetings here in oxford   now we shall go down to the crocodile infested river    come on  let's concentrate on finding jameson   over here   are you all right  no  i'm bloody terrified   you're all right in public  terrified for eric   i can guess where he is  me too  that's why i'm terrified   well  that's very good  yes   where is it  you asked me to think about eric   did this for eric last year   jameson's father's in the church  do you know where this is  philip   no  eric gave me a photograph to copy   but i remember it  it looks like this   may i   i know where that is  from your spiritual background   no  i played there last year with the band   thanks  philip   look  all ready for a quick getaway   mr jameson   i'm inspector lewis   i have sgt hathaway with me   no need to be running away   two people have died   safest place you can be is with us   good decision   why don't we take a pew   you can tell us what's been going on   is this good cop bad cop   no  you're a very lucky lad  this is two good cops   start with the gun  the one you planted in philip's room   honestly  i don't know anything about that   so  why did you run away  cos i'm scared   i'd forgotten my folks were away   all right  let's do the easy bit   the forgeries   reg chapman delivered some packages to you at the betting shop   what happened to them after that   i gave them to nell  and when she'd finished with them   i'd return them to reg   you'd really no idea what it was all about  no   i assumed it was one of her wacky projects   you know   art   with nell   everything was art   mr jameson   it is   are you all right   mr jameson is with a couple of honest  english cops   oh   quentin jackson  my father adored duke ellington   quentin jackson was a trombone player in the duke's band   antiques  first editions  original manuscripts   that's correct  and you were on nell buckley's tour   i saw the video   this could be the start of a special relationship   do you want to tell us what you're doing here   well  a client of mine in the states  bought two shelley manuscripts   and he was offered the chance to buy the frankenstein letters   the holy grail  precisely   but he was a little concerned about their provenance   so he commissioned me to come and   check out the small print   correct   when i arrived  i felt like i was surrounded by murder and mayhem   and i became genuinely concerned over the safety of the boy   after what had happened to the girl   how did you know he'd be here   i told professor walters  in my best bronx accent   i wanted to make an offer he couldn't refuse   so  she gave me his home address   and when i discovered it was the vicarage and nobody was there   i     yeah  i took an educated guess   professor walters  yes  she's a mathematician   how does she fit into your equation   oh  she sold my client the manuscripts of the poems   and offered to supply the letters   do you carry a gun  mr jackson   in my country i have a constitutional right to bear arms   but i've always chosen to ignore it   like my father  i have an enduring love  of the music of duke ellington   nobody can love that music  and be a party to the taking of human life   i'd like a statement of all your dealings with professor walters   i am at your disposal  inspector   quentin  thank you   did you write these   with that   yes  they're lovely to write with  you can do thin lines or thick   but nell told you what to put  hm   i'm no good at making things up   you know forgery's a crime   she said it would only be a crime if she sold them   she wasn't going to tell them   it was her project  it couldn't be a crime if it was a project   oh   she taught me how to spell frankenstein  very good   not sure i could spell frankenstein  i can spell prometheus  as well   come with me  philip  all right   can philip have your desk   am i going to play at being a policeman   why not  we do it all day   pretend you're a policeman trying to find out what happened to nell   that's a sad thing to do   yeah  sometimes policeman have to do sad things   philip  could you spell prometheus for me   p  r  o  m  e  t  h  e  u  s   gone   whatever was there has been wiped   leave it  we're gonna do some applied mathematics   knock at door  come in  darling  i'm decent   that doesn't have to be permanent   ah   mistaken identity   seemingly  you can probably guess why we're here   as you know  my area of expertise is probability   seems to me the probability is  you're going to accuse me of involvement  in some kind of criminal activity   aiding and abetting the distribution of forged and stolen manuscripts   via the good offices of a gentleman called quentin jackson   with a probability you'll obtain a warrant   so you can delve around in my correspondence and computer files   whereas you'll find no mention of anybody called jackson   it's not a probability  that's a certainty   well  let me save you the trouble   help yourself  do it now   knock at door  this sounds like darling   what's happening   i've just invited the forces of law and order  to make a thorough search of all my records   i'll settle for the necklace   what's that  usb stick   all the files on her computer she didn't want anyone to see   what  hanging round her neck  once a gambler     prometheus     walters stole nell's files  she could have planted the gun  too   finished   well  that's very good  tell us about it   it's the man by the river bank the day nell wasn't there   do you know the man's name   no   could you draw him  he was too far away to see   but he got into this car with that woman   and then they drove away   he's written the number plate down   yes  i remember numbers   do you think the probability is they're planning to run away   we're going to a bridge tournament in aylesbury   we had thought to make a push for the mexican border before nightfall   why should we be running away   we have a witness who was by the river the day you killed nell   and who saw you get into a car   this car  to be precise   driven by your good friend and bridge partner   your very good friend professor walters   a reliable witness  or that idiot boy from the art school   that  idiot boy  is the best witness i've ever met   who will be torn to shreds by any self respecting defence lawyer   unlike quentin jackson   i've never heard of him  alistair     according to the information we found around your neck   and supported by mr jackson   you two received  50 000 from an american horror movie buff  for the first of a series of letters from shelley to mary   detailing the plot of frankenstein   why jeopardise good academic careers for such a venture   over the last year you've played in bridge tournaments in paris  geneva   rome  new york   you've stayed in five star hotels  you've flown first class   all on university salaries   but it isn't that  is it   you did it to see whether you could  the ultimate gamble   beating the bank   it's not about beating the bank   it's about beating fate   and we very nearly did   not only that  you almost got away with murder   it was nothing to with me  and the cock crowed a third time   you were also at the bodleian the day reg chapman was murdered   i don't deny it  it's an old fashioned library   and the old fashioned librarians will confirm  that i was at the main entrance at 10am and left two hours later   yeah  but the new fangled security cameras at the rear of the building  will confirm that you did meet chapman a little later   when he came outside for a cigarette   and you both went back inside   i assume chapman wanted more money  and if you didn't pay   he was gonna blow the whistle on the forged manuscripts   chapman was a gambler    and pathetic into the bargain   nell buckley was a little bit more complicated   you recruited her and philip horton to forge the shelley poems   then she came to you with an even more exciting idea    the frankenstein letters   all you had to do was authenticate them   and wait for the money to start rolling in   and
