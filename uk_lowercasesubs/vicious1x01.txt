 oh  my god   oh  how dreadful   poor clive   at least he didn't suffer   oh  he did   oh  my  that much   oh  well  i prefer to remember him as i last saw him   being fed apple sauce by a jamaican woman   well  it's a reminder that we should spend as much time as possible  with those we hold dear while we're able   anyway  thank you for calling  mother   for a moment  i thought those high pitched  piercing shrieks  were coming from a gaggle of schoolgirls   but now i see it's just you   i shan't be able to return to sleep now  thanks muchly   who do you think you are  the earl of grantham   you're from wigan   it's better than being from leytonstone   how dare you   i've been to oxford   yes  for lunch   who were you squawking at on the phone just now   my mother  if you must know   was she calling to tell you when she'd be dying   she was very distraught   why  did you finally tell her about us   i'm waiting for the right time   it's been 48 years   and there has not been a right time   please  don't pressure me  i'm very emotional already   we've had some frightful news   clive is dead   your mother is always the first to know when someone dies   is she getting the news directly from satan   i would think you'd be a little more upset considering your history   that was a long time ago  we were all in our early 20s   what  i was 19  i wasn't in my 20s   people used to think i was your nephew   yes  because you told them you were my nephew   anyway  i do feel bad about clive  i just hope he didn't suffer   apparently  they had to cut a foot off   so i assume there was some discomfort   i dare say those thick ankles of his put up quite a fight   who on earth is that   i have no idea  are you expecting anybody  no   these aren't calling hours   this is outrageous   you just don't go about ringing people's doorbells   let's just see who it is   and then put the whole ugly business behind us   well  i'm going to give this intruder a real dressing down   aaaah   hello  can we help you with something   ash  i didn't even know that was a name   i was here to see about the flat  is this a bad time   no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  not at all   great  yes  great   can i get you some tea   no  thanks  i'd just really like to see the flat   you've come to the wrong door  i'm afraid   the flat for rent is one floor up  oh  sorry   don't be sorry  i'm freddie   this is stuart  my friend   freddie thornhill   you probably recognise me from the television or the stage   do you go to the theatre often  ash   am i saying that correctly   yeah  ash   i don't get to the theatre much   well  of course  you're a young man  you do young man things   i'm quite certain i'm old enough to be your father  yes  i'm quite certain  too   my father's 46  ah  and so am i   do you mind if i use your toilet   mind  we'd be devastated if you didn't   you are making such a fool of yourself   then you should leave  it's quite clear he hates you   do you suppose he's  family    oh  god   it's so tricky to tell now   i thought graham norton was straight   well  my dear stuart  i will work it out   after all  i did spend a year playing the detective in  the mousetrap  oh  please   our postman's been in the mousetrap   this is complete lunacy   it's like victoria station   who's there   it's violet  darling   i came as soon as i heard   poor clive  yes  it's been a great shock  as you can imagine   we're absolutely devastated   now  i must ask you  anything  darling   is leytonstone any better than wigan   a bit  darling  bollocks   i was thinking perhaps we should host a small gathering here tomorrow   just our little circle   that will be lovely   i can't believe he's gone   dear  sweet clive   did you hear about the foot  yes  unfortunate   oh  damn  i wanted to tell you   poor freddie  you were quite close  back in the day   well  clive was very much smitten with me  that is true   obsessed  really   i was young  handsome  famous   you were barely one of those things   i'm just going to use the loo before i go out   there has to be somebody who hasn't heard about that foot   oh  he's still in there  who's still in there   the young man who came to see about the flat upstairs  he's been ages   go and see what's going on  no  no  i don't want to disturb him   it's very rude to disturb attractive people   well  we can't leave him in there all day   you let a complete stranger use your loo   what if he comes out and rapes me   let's cross that bridge when we come to it  shall we   everything all right in there  ash   well  we tried   so that's it  then  i don't see what else we can do   try calling him again  no  you try   somebody do something  i'm so frightened i'm going to be raped   oh  for god's sake  violet  nobody wants to rape you   what an awful thing to say   thanks very much  of course   everything all right   yeah  sorry  had to make a call   ah  a call to your      mate  i see   a close mate  i guess   i see  and is this your special mate   er  dunno   i should probably go and see that flat now   has anybody ever said you remind them of zac efron   that's a person  right   or is it a place   this is our friend violet  ash   yes  she's our friend and stuart here is my  friend    uh    ok   haven't i seen you in my yoga class  i go to yoga  i'm great fun   i don't think so   well  i'm certain i know you  have you ever been to zac efron   i'm covered either way now   i should probably go  it was nice meeting you all   and good luck with the flat  i do hope we become neighbours   and you can bring round here anybody you like   boys  girls  whichever you prefer   thanks   nicely done  miss marple   i only hope his flesh didn't rot off where you touched him   i'm surprised you could see it  through the milky film that coats your cataracts   i'm going to make another pot of tea   i never know when i'm going too far  but i'm always so glad when i do   your mother looked well for someone who doesn't have a heartbeat   she always rallies for a funeral   do you know  freddie  as grotesque a thought as it is   you might have been the love of clive's life   i do believe i was   it's sad that it took the passing of a dear friend  to make me realise how special i am   are you wearing mascara   no   well  i must prepare for our guests  i want everything to be perfect   i bought two sandwiches that i can cut up into sixteenths   that should do it   oh  that is it   we are disconnecting this bell   oh  hello   it's ash   you'll tell me if i'm ever pronouncing that wrong   i hope i'm not bothering you  bothering us   we should give you a key   i was just stopping by to let you know i got the upstairs flat   oh  goody   in fact  i'm moving in today  oh  marvelous   stuart  my friend  will be so pleased   you remember him  shrunken  old gnome   great  i love spending time with oaps   no  i'm not one  he is  not me   sometimes i pretend to be  in order to get concessions at the cinema   but they don't usually believe me   would you excuse me a moment  and do not look at my awards  while i'm in the other room  i'd be very embarrassed   they're over there   we're both very excited  freddie tells me the good news   close those curtains  the light  the light   freddie tells me the good news   you must join us for tea  thanks   so  you never use the huge window   no  we also don't go around pulling cords in other people's flats   go on  we're done with you for now    clive was smitten with me that entire summer   we had magical weather  it only rained 60 days   i was on tour with erm    shakespeare  i believe   that's right  the two of you were old school chums   you must forgive stuart  he was never loved as a child   or as an adult   egg and cress sandwich  mason   is that what that is   i thought it was a crumb surrounded by a toothpick   perhaps you'd like some of what you brought   i could always cut you a slice of nothing   penelope   penelope  one more time  darling   penelope   oh  i'm sorry  i was sleeping   sleeping  your eyes were wide open   oh  that's troubling   oh  i'm going to miss clive   i do believe you broke his heart  freddie   thank you   i still have some of the old letters that clive wrote to me   oh  i have some of my old letters that were written to me     we're not talking about your life now   i always thought clive was so dashing   every young man wanted to be seen on the arm of clive st  claire   the most eligible bachelor in london   i seem to remember a wife  wasn't there a wife at some point   oh  that was ages ago  and it was only for 19 years   no  clive was a true man's man   independent  free as a bird   and children  weren't there children   yes  six   are you through interrupting or shall i hand you a microphone   oh  what's happening  what is that   that must be our new neighbour   the boy from the toilet   the one who was flirting with me shamelessly   no  this is a person who exists   did you find out if he's      no  he's being very cagey   hi  i hope you like cakes   oh  look  somebody brought something   you must meet our friends  this is penelope and that is mason   and you remember our friend violet   from zac efron  remember   you're all dressed in black  is    is everything all right   oh  didn't we tell you  this is more of a tea wake   oh  i'm sorry  who died   a good friend of mine  he was very dear to all of us   can i get anybody another sandwich   yes  i'd like ten more  please   i'm hoping to smush them all together to create a bite   were you good friends   we were  a long time ago   do you know  why don't i read out one of clive's old letters   wouldn't that be lovely  not unless you read it in another room   ash  would you prefer to sit on my lap   i have very strong bones   ah  here's one that hasn't been opened    my one and only     i can't imagine my life without you   what a kind  generous man you are   if i only knew you felt the same   i would leave everything behind to start a new with you   just say yes   always  clive    he really loved you  no  he didn't   what are you talking about  and you have lipstick all over your teeth   look at the envelope  it's addressed to stuart  stuart    my god   oh  i dozed off again   what did i miss   that is preposterous  why would he have been interested in stuart   he says it right here  because i was kind and generous and handsome   it says kind and generous  you added handsome   i don't understand  i never even received this letter   it must have got mixed in with all my fan mail   you have one fan   who writes a lot of letters   well  it doesn't matter now anyway  that was 50 years ago   i could have had a completely different life if i'd seen the letter   not this hell i've been trapped in   you've been in hell  i've provided you with everything  you could ever want since the moment we met   you were pulling pints in a pub  i was the manager   and i was going to be a model  you were never going to be a model   no  not with you sucking the life out of me   i aged five years just sharing a taxi with you that night   is that why you look a thousand   you're practically melting onto the rug   ouch  should i go   why  don't be ridiculous  of course not   it's all right  darling  sit   um    your hand is really high up on my thigh   is it   well  i don't see what the problem is   it's not as if clive was any great prize   he had children  he was married  wasn't there a second wife  too   ash  why don't you pour yourself a cup of tea  instead of sitting there like a statue  i'm sorry   i'm not quite sure how to behave  have you never been a guest before   you must engage in the conversation   maybe he's shy   are you shy  darling  is that it   because you are behaving oddly   it's empty  there's a fresh pot in the kitchen  i'll get it   no  i'll get it   is it something we're doing   is it us  no  it's definitely him   they have no manners nowadays   exactly  interact  ask questions   well  chinese people are very quiet   he's not chinese   i think there's something wrong with your dog   balthazar  why  what's he doing  he's just lying there   i think he's unconscious  oh  no  he's only sleeping   i stepped on him and he didn't move   he's 20  you see   and yet still younger than the biscuits   i didn't think dogs lived that long   he's more of a doorstopper at this point   you see  you would never have had balthazar  had you been with clive instead of freddie   or    any of the others   that's a lot of dogs  we went through several very quickly   this used to be a bus route   i just wish i could've had the chance to have known  what that life could have been   do you really think you would have had a better life without me   yes  i could have been happy and successful   instead of being stuck with you in this penitentiary   do you think i've been happy  with you simpering around this flat   pouring your blandness onto every surface   i don't know what would be preferable at this point   if you woke up dead or i did   i know which i'd prefer   i'll tell you what would've happened to you   you would've ended up the same worthless prat you are today   your accent just came out   hey  his accent just came out  you all heard it   it most certainly didn't  and at least i'm not from leytonstone   wigan's worse  i'm from wigan   this is not the time to contribute  darling   what exactly have you done with your life   bit parts in rep and one episode of dr who   what an illustrious career to look back on   at least i've had a career  and i'm still at it   i'm still working  you've had nothing  you've done nothing   i think i hear the dog   is this over yet then  freddie   no  it is not   clive would have loved this   i think  i'm not sure  really   what actually is this   i also killed a prostitute on coronation street   among others  other prostitutes   other shows  you're becoming very annoying   is he going to be all right  stuart  of course   you know what it can be like with certain  friends    i guess  do you have a very close friend  ash   not now  no  i see   but in the past  you have been in a relationship with another    person   i have  but i've never been in love   ah  you're young  you'll meet that special someone   i suppose   i should really go   please tell stuart i said thank you  of course   and i hope you've had fun   and maybe learned a little bit about social graces as well   has he been here this whole time   oh  and by the way    i'm straight   well  that came out of nowhere   you're up late   i was just going to pour myself a drink   care for one   fine  don't answer  i prefer it   you behaved abominably today   she speaks   don't let's do this now  i'm so tired   entertaining is exhausting   i suppose i'm not tired because i do nothing  i did nothing   i am nothing   you're still going on about that  will you forget about it  please   i can never forget it   you said some very hurtful things which you can never take back   i don't see how we can ever get over this   stuart  i'm sorry  oh  that's all right   oh  what on earth    is that someone calling  this lunacy   hello   oh  hello  mother   yes  i'm still awake   i'm here with my    flatmate   oh  for christ's sake  stuart   he says   hello  mrs bixby    oh  my god   oh  how dreadful   when   poor oliver   another one  shit
