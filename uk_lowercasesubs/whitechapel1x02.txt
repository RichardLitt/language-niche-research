we have a dead woman in whitechapel  ready to head up your first murder  oh  yes   di chandler  ds miles  you worked a murder scene before   i think the killer knelt by her head  then cut her throat left to right with his right hand   the man who killed your lady was copying jack the ripper   the man who's attacking these women in 2008 is his biggest fan  we have a copycat   detach yourself  and if another woman dies   then  we never had this conversation   you were right  so  all you've got to do now  is solve the unsolvable and catch the most famous serial killer ever    i'm here to see the commander   the murder of alice graves is an exact recreation  of the murder of annie chapman   alice graves was found in a backyard with her throat cut  and body horribly mutilated  just like annie chapman in 1888   it was virtually identical  down to the date   the time  the things left at her feet  the envelope nearby   the pathologist was sure that whoever did this had no specialist medical knowledge   he can handle a knife and the gore  but he's an amateur   working from coroner's reports of the ripper's victims   we get the picture  inspector   if he is copying jack the ripper  as you say   then we can expect three more murders   not if we can stop him  when did you identify this pattern   eight days ago   and alice graves died when   yesterday morning   if you knew a murder was going to happen   we should have been told   it was only a theory up until yesterday  i didn't have any proof   joe  wait   at least i know where i stand  i'm protecting you   i'm under pressure to replace you with a more senior officer   so  replace me  and when i'm debriefed   don't expect me to lie about what you knew and when you knew it   fine   stay on it   but don't run to me once the press get hold of it   my obligation to you ends when it hits the headlines   good luck  joe   ok  everyone  attention   oh  here we go   here we have wholemeal salmon sandwiches   fresh fruit  nuts  juice   brain food  gentlemen   in the bin   it helps concentration and stamina   bin  it'll give me wind   everything gives you wind  research   read them carefully   look for anything to get us inside the killer's head   one of these books is his bible   i can't remember the last time i read a book   right  well  you can have the dvds   claim overtime for that  fitz   what do we know about alice graves   she was 36 years old  she had three children   separated   she saw an alcoholic   and definitely on the game   she was badly bruised around the face sometime before death   find out who did that and what it was about   sarah smith  who found her  must know something   we've got to appeal for witnesses  broaden the enquiry   you can go on tv  no   yeah  no   i could go  no   there are three murders to go  we can't let on to the press  it'll create panic   we'll have every crackpot owning up to being jack and the home office will be on our backs   you don't know that'll happen  i do  history tells us so   i know what happens next   i go and get some proper food   i'm getting my bacon roll back   keep your phone on  any trouble  call me straight away   she'll be all right   i'll take this one   how's tricks   you know  seen better   i'll buy you a coffee  you can tell me about it   fitz  get the soco file on alice graves  we're up   sir  can i have a word  sure   by the way    i saved a book for you   jill the ripper  t'riffic   i had a word with sarah smith last night   the tom who found the body   she's very jumpy  she said all the girls are  but     there's a regular  a soldier   who's beating girls  threatening to gut them   and get this  he carries a bayonet   did sarah smith give you a name  no  they call him the squaddie   he's always boasting about how he guards the queen   sarah said he was ok  but he went out to helmand province and ain't been the same since   he don't want sex any more  just gets off on scaring 'em   only the real desperate toms'll go with him  fitz   you got that envelope  yeah   this was found beside the body of alice graves   it's the regimental crest from the household division   based at clarence barracks   we got a prime suspect for you   the guards are on inspection at 3pm   there's no way sarah would do anything official   this is the best i could manage   thanks for meeting us  girls   this is my colleague  detective inspector chandler   ladies  shall we watch the show   squad   shun   squad   stand at ease   squad     third from the right   shun   that's him   innit   it's definitely him   excuse me  dc mccormack   oh  yes  er   i got your message   er  alice graves   i pulled her file   come with me   oh  she went to the larkin trust  is that a hostel   no  no  no  it's an organisation for women with alcohol problems   it's   a bit out of date   but the address is still good  we need to know about her last admission to a e   she came in with facial injuries   nothing serious  some bruises sustained in a fight with a client   she was a prostitute  did she know who the guy was   she was so drunk when she came in  she could hardly speak   but she did say something about    a soldier   ok  good  thanks very much   thank you   hello   this is unofficial  ok   purely advisory  yes  yes  absolutely   i'll be the very soul of discretion   my watson to your holmes  eh   we found this at the scene  with a portion of regimental crest on the envelope       which was placed next to alice's body   there was a torn envelope by annie chapman's body  but it was a red herring   it had nothing to do with jack   the first victim thought her attacker was a soldier   one wound could have been made by a bayonet   and now this regimental mark on the envelope   it all points to the killer being a soldier   he's creating the world for you   the same murders  the same mysterious suspects   the same   mysterious lines of enquiry   he wants you to think he's a soldier  or a man in a leather apron   because  if you're looking for them  you're not looking for him   he wants to make you his inspector abberline   the policeman who couldn't catch the ripper  mm   the point of being jack the ripper was to get away with it   and never be found   i can't believe the guy's left no trace  we've nothing from forensics   it's like he knows what we look for and how we find it   or he's a phantom  then  the police were so desperate   they even considered photographing the eyes of the victims   they thought their dying retinas might have held an image of the killer   could you imagine  a picture of jack in the eyes of the dead   so   what couldn't wait   i wanted to check her eyes  we've gone over every inch of her  there's nothing   not her eyelids  her eyes   that's off the peg  i know   got two pairs of trousers  too  to even up the wear   you look like the boss  nah  his suits are handmade   savile row  wind the skipper up   your attention  please  ladies   private john leary   history of violence against women   he threatened a teenager with a knife in germany  and he wounded a young woman in aldershot   his regiment have dealt with everything up until now   they describe him as 'troubled'   now  his leaves don't tally exactly  with the murders  but we can't rule him out   he's a very naughty boy   you get all that  boss  yes  i heard   bring him in   we've found the killer's dna on alice graves  so we'll get a sample from leary   what dna  the body was clean  it was on her eyeballs   how did it get there  he wanted to leave his image on her dying eyes   so he licked them   are you a regular client of prostitutes    john leary   private  2 4 1 9 6 0 3 4   did you know the prostitute alice graves   john leary  private   do you know the crack house near brick lane where alice graves' body was found   john leary  private  jesus christ  you haven't been captured by the bloody enemy   this isn't afghanistan and you're not the bloody sas   is this all we'll get  he's not obliged to say anything that may incriminate him   if he wants to play guantanomo bay  can we shock his bollocks till he chats   that's not funny  detective  oh  really  i'm laughing   you know the house  did you take alice there  john leary   we know  you used to beat her up  was that not enough for you any more   john leary  private    'private john leary of the queen's foot guard  based at clarence barracks   was arrested by police this afternoon  and is being held on suspicion   ' we're missing a trick   an appeal on here could jog a few memories   turn up all kinds of witnesses   we've had this through from forensics   bayonet's clean  no blood traces at all   shit   and the eyeball dna's been contaminated   i've had to release leary   leary's not in the clear yet   he just got lucky   what is it  skip  eyeball dna's contaminated   bayonet's clean   oh  you're joking  oh  no   oh  what   why is the director of forensic science suddenly signing off on the evidence   why is he doing labwork   that's unheard of  the director doing labwork   it's a cover up   well     the original jack was a cover up   in my 342 page book   the original jack was a masonic conspiracy  to protect the duke of clarence   he had married a catholic whore and the other women were all witnesses at the wedding   who's the duke of clarence  is that charles   charles  no   listen   the whores were witnesses to a wedding  the palace wanted to keep secret   so  the palace had the girls killed   that was the conspiracy then  so  what is it now   if we knew that  it wouldn't be much of a conspiracy   it's just one theory out of hundreds  my book has jack as a sailor who went to live in jamaica   in my book  jack's a woman  well  maybe  though   the palace has something to hide  yeah  hold on a minute   alice graves     used this support unit for alchies   and guess who the patron was   princess diana   you want a conspiracy   you want a wedding that's been covered up   this   is the mother   don't mess   with the masons   leary is a good suspect   we'll get the evidence cos he did it  no one's covering anything up   so  no more conspiracies  no more masons   and no more scotch  either   yes   'turn on the news '  '  happened to these murders  the tabloids are reporting  that jack the ripper is back  and killing women again in the east end of london   sources also suggest that the police   already under fire for being slow to react to the case   are looking into a possible masonic connection '  'you have a leak  sort it out '  'the murder of alice graves is likely to be the second  in a series of five planned attacks '  you happy now  what   someone has compromised the entire investigation   what are you insinuating  you know  i'm not the leak   you wanted rid of me at the start  i'd do that   i am staying till we get an arrest  so  the hell with you   oi  i've been doing this job for 20 years   i have to trust the loyalty of my men  would i  risk that for a streak of piss like you   you'll screw this investigation up without my help   i will find your leak for you  and you will apologise   i like single malts  not that blended shit   now that this is out in the open  we'll be inundated  with false leads  false confessions and false alarms   not to mention the public getting in our way   the press are offering cash for clues   they want to beat us to the ripper   the home office is under pressure   and our top brass   which means that we are under 24 hour scrutiny   we cannot make any mistakes  we cannot be fallible   fally who  i know there's been talk  about conspiracies and masons and cover ups  i want it to stop now   i want to get back on track  which is why i've asked an impartial expert  to come in and talk to you today   mr buchan   oh  not the ripperologist   are you out of your mind   we need an objective view  a step back   oh  he's a step back all right   it's fine   should i just begin  yes  go ahead   imagine  whitechapel  1888   a place so terrible that jack london called it the abyss   ed  masons   yes  yes   there is no conspiracy   the masonic conspiracy of jack the ripper  is the biggest load of bunkum ever to taint true ripperology   based on a total disregard of the known facts of the case   crime conspiracy is the last resort of an investigator   it's a way of saying it's not your fault you can't solve it   yeah  well  why did the director handle the evidence  huh   good point  it was a favour to me  actually   i wanted the best   oi  eyes front   it doesn't explain the larkin trust  alice graves  she used to go there   so did cathy lane  i checked   may i er      it's another myth   that the canonical victims knew each other   he'll be recreating pea soupers for us next   clever boy   you don't have to keep turning them  let them cook   oi  i'm still in charge  who's for another beer   please  fitz  no  no  thank you   you found your pub in the country yet   yeah  saw a lovely place in sussex   don't come cheap  huh  tell me about it   we're already remortgaged up to the hilt as it is   still  the money from the papers must help  right   what  is    is that what i'm about  is it   i'm just saying   i understand why you did it   can't live your dream on a pension  can you   a few bob in my pocket and screw you guys   yeah  right   i'm outta here   what's up  where are you going   he thinks i'm the leak  thinks i sold you out for a few grand   don't be daft  come on  have a beer   they're on me   since when   never see your wallet in the bar  do we   well  it's   just a beer   that's your guilty conscience  fitz   it's a beer  come on  fitz  i can see it in your face  tell us   i didn't do it for the money   i did it so we could get a new di   i did it for you  skip   it's what you wanted  innit   here   i'm sorry   hey  ray   can i borrow this for further study  i'll return it in the morning   out of the question   i understand   absolutely   the double event is imminent   the night jack killed not one  but two women in the space of  catherine eddowes was killed in mitre square  on the cobbles   it's the only murder site that still exists   you can stand on that exact spot today   he'll definitely be tempted by that  it's so authentic   there's cctv in mitre square  it's completely overlooked   he wouldn't be so stupid  he'd be caught in minutes  game over   hm  mitre square's too important to miss   and he gets to take away her kidney   he can't do it  it's impossible  i'd definitely regard  mitre square as a probable murder site   all right  i'll keep an eye on it   but we're gonna focus on private leary   watch every move he makes  it's not him   he fits the description of emma jones's attacker   we know he assaulted alice graves before her murder   he's our prime suspect   well  then you have to ask yourself  will there be a double event or not   what do you mean   there's a growing body of thought that jack was not responsible for both murders   i thought elizabeth stride and catherine eddowes were definite   it's a recent theory  not mainstream   liz stride had her throat cut  but she wasn't mutilated   the classic theory is that he must have been disturbed   so found another victim to sate himself   but     no signs of strangulation   the coroner found a dissimilarity with how her throat was cut  and believed a different weapon was used   no mutilation  different mo  different signature   her death could have been a coincidence  wrongly linked to jack   so  a classic ripper fan will kill twice   but if it's an alternative theorist  once   in essence  yes  so  which one is he   that's up to you  joe  you're the expert   but it's your investigation  oh  jesus   all i have is     history   i've got   nothing   tangible   nothing     nothing right now     right here to help me  i mean     it was a dead woman in whitechapel  a simple domestic   i wasn't     i'm not supposed to be doing this   look  my     whole career       has been mapped out by other people   just trying to fast track me on to     i'm the wrong man for this job   but if we catch this man tomorrow night   you will be the man who captured the ripper   for ever   no one catches the ripper   history says so   have a good  long look  mary   take your time   none of them jump out at me  it was very dark   i only remember seeing the knife  i'm sorry   how about him   ring any bell   maybe    it's possible   it could be him  good girl   mary's just picked out leary   that's a positive id from mary and sarah smith  good   let's go ahead with it  then   we need to catch private leary in the act   as we know  the time's important to him   if he's our killer  he'll attempt the first murder at 1am tonight  in henrique's street   mccormack  i want you there  kent and sanders  you'll be in clarence barracks   the mod have agreed access  so you can watch the accommodation block   i'll be out front with the boss   the second murder was in mitre square at 1 45   there'll no doubt be a public presence of press an onlookers   we'll have uniforms there  and leary is under observation from now on   our objective is surveillance  we don't make a move until he does   this is it   no mistakes   when we get leary  let his nibs read him his rights  give him his moment   sorry   all right  darling  you take care tonight  ladies   all quiet here  sir   kent  only use the radio when something's happening   'out '  we're right about leary  yeah  we are right   it's the one thing you and i agree on   mitre square  please give your situation report   mitre square  north side  everything under control  over   all right  fine   mitre square  all clear on the south side  over   mccormack  situation report   pissed off   cold    and very thirsty  sir   shit   we're up   'suspect in military clothing '  he's coming down the scaffolding   'rear of the barracks '  'ok  all units  here we go '  suspect is awol   on the move  heading towards you  kent  he has a bag   kent  have you got him in sight   'kent  have you got him in sight '  trailing suspect on foot   'kent  situation report '  'for god's sake  kent  can you see him '  suspect is heading towards perimeter wall near you  sir   'now wearing a baseball cap and a dark jacket '  he's got accomplices  it is a bloody conspiracy  we're on the move   he's got into a dark car   can't read the registration  looks like two male ic 1s with him   he must be heading for the kill   tailing suspect heading west  all units  stand by   this doesn't make sense  it's the wrong direction   the murder sites are east   he's trying to lose us  well  stick with him   what do you think i'm doing    he's messing with us   what's he doing now   he's turning back   trailing suspect east  all units  stand by  trailing suspect east   what's going on  what's he playing at   are you trying to frame private leary   'this is mitre square  we've had a disturbance '  it's the bloody press  we've been set up   yet you're no closer to catching the murderer   there's a disturbance at mitre square  but no one's been killed   out of the way  move   police   please  for god's sake   joe  thank god   joe   is anybody in the square  is anybody in the square   it's mary   he got mary   this is impossible  there's nobody here   he ain't human  he can't be   joe    thank god   i didn't get their numbers  but i wish to lodge a complaint   joe  i want to complain against the two gorillas  who arrested me and threw me in the van   mother'll be in a terrible state  wondering where i am   joe  do you think i could have my laces back   not yet  mr buchan   this way  mr buchan   oh   i see   where were you at 1 30am this morning   i was staking out the exact spot  where catherine eddowes was murdered in 1888   you were hiding from the police   i wanted to catch the ripper   i've been hunting him all my life  and now here he is again  made flesh   he is my nemesis   he's mine to bring to justice  so  that's why you wanted to help   to get an inside track on the investigation of yourself   i'm sorry  joe   having committed the offence of obstruction  by entering a restricted area   you were escorted from the square at 1 41am   by the gorillas  correct   was there anyone else in the actual square  no   look  i caused a bit of a ruckus and i'm sorry about that   but   he didn't even show up  so  no harm done  eh   at 1 45 am     the body of a woman was found in mitre square   the body of a woman   that's impossible  he   he couldn't have  there was no time   he had four minutes  but   all he needed was a distraction   like the mini riot that you caused   me   you think he used me  you made it possible   his accomplice   i am edward buchan  respected authority on jack the ripper   i am not a killer   nor do i serve one   how dare you   mrs buchan   police  we have a warrant to search yours and your son's premises  may i come in   caravan international   looks like he pays his bills on time  yeah  course he does  he's a saint   he's in a dispute with the council     over a neighbour's plans for an extension   i mean  it's not really     well  where's all the ripper stuff  then   i thought he was the world's foremost expert  does he keep it all in his head   mrs buchan  mrs buchan  what's down here   oh  that's my son's study  i haven't got a key   got a screwdriver   ta very much   bloody hell   i knew it   it's like an incident room   from 1888   it's a killer's lair   look at all this   he's a ripperologist  this is what he does for a living   he's even got his own website   look  this ain't from 1888   he was helping the investigation  this doesn't prove anything   he's involved  i'll prove it  i've got a nose for this   you haven't   obviously   he cut her throat first   it's savage  right through to the vertebrae   the abdomen has been completely opened up   there's a stab wound in the liver   genital mutilation   the colon's been cut away and the kidney and uterus have been removed   exactly the same as catherine eddowes in 1888   however  when you come to her face  the injuries are completely different   there were v shaped marks made on catherine eddowes   whereas here    well  he's clearly tried to slice mary's face off   in my experience   this kind of severe facial mutilation  strongly indicates a relationship between the killer and his victim   they may well have known each other   catherine eddowes said she knew who the ripper was and would claim the reward   mary bousfield got a good look at cathy lane's killer   and he got a good look at her  too   bastard   what have we got  ok   this is the cctv from mitre square   it shows all eight cameras from both the north and south sides   here  on the south side  they find buchan hiding and make the arrest   taking him around the square to the north side   all the press and onlookers follow buchan's arrest   leaving the south side clear   this creates a diversion for the killer to dump mary's body   he enters the square through these shutters on the south east corner  and drags mary's body into the square   jesus  we were minutes away   the shutters here lead to an underground car park  entered from fenchurch street   we're getting the tapes from the council   he must have used a vehicle for his getaway   excellent work  thank you  sir   i have the printouts from buchan's message boards   it worked like this   someone   jack2000 or springhill   would ask a question about the murders   like  was there a double event   buchan gives some longwinded answer  then somebody else writes in    slasher jack  with a different theory    buchan replies  on and on and on it goes   how many people were on the site  about 100   but look at this  one name had a regular q a with our friend buchan    i told you  i got a nose for this   can computer crime trace this  they can try  but look   the last contact was on the night of the first murder   you do buchan's interviews from now on  yes  sir   i owe you a bottle    you haven't shaved  sorry  sir  i haven't been home yet   you look like a drowning man   everything's under control   many would like your place at this table   you could at least change your shirt   why did you ask me here   i gave your late father my word   a place at the table   in time  at the top of the force   but in the current climate     i have my own position to consider  i did warn you   i understand  you need to take a step back   unless i catch the ripper  in which case  you'll be standing by my side   nobody asked you to sacrifice yourself   work the shift  go home   you have a sergeant  use him   let him shoulder it   protect yourself enough that  when it's over  you still have some standing   do you even know their names  whose names   the victims  your problem is  you can't see it's irrelevant   mary bousfield  he cut out her kidney and sliced her face off   we are eating   i do apologise   where is detective inspector chandler  busy   ripperfan   oh  the message boards   i've no inkling as to who these people are   you're happy to discuss how to cut up women with 'em   i simply relate the historical facts to them  and  if necessary  correct their thinking   read it    an inch below the crease of the thigh  was a cut extending from the anterior spine of the ileum  obliquely down the inner side of     the left thigh  yes   yes  that is from the autopsy performed by dr brown on catherine eddowes    that   is murder pornography   this information is in the public domain   i don't tell them what to do with it   someone like ripperfan     who is so interested in your opinion of the double event       and shared your belief that catherine eddowes  was the only ripper victim that night    i know what you're implying   you think he's the killer and i'm in it with him   why would i do that   tell me about marks on catherine eddowes' face   well   ok   the autopsy report states that she had distinctive marks to her face   like erm   inverted vs on her cheeks   and the tip of her nose was cut off  as well as cuts to her eyelids   some ripperologists think that these are masonic markings   but you've got your own theory  well  yes  i do   i think he tried to cut catherine's face off   you see  cutting down like so would cut the eyelids  remove the nose  and cut into the cheek   i can't be certain  but it does make sense   yeah  it does   it did to ripperfan   cos he did exactly what you told him to   he sliced mary's face off   ripperfan's the killer  and you're his  what  mentor   sounding board   special advisor   you tell me   the cctv from the car park in fenchurch street shows a van   it's from a c maduro  health and safety  a small medical supply company   the md is a mr maduro   he's stopped all his vans  but he's not happy at all   if such a murder had occurred in one of my vans  i would have noticed   the vans are clean  there is no blood   you'll have to just bear with us  please  sir   i need my vans back on the road   we supply organ transportation   not just body bags and rubber gloves   and we have urgent medical transfers   over here   positive signs of blood all over this van   we've got a murder scene   i want a thorough search of this van   what do you want  i asked to see joe   well  you've got me   so  i am the lowest of the low now   i don't have to be here  you know  what do you want  please   stand back   ask joe  has the killer sent the kidney yet   mary bousfield's kidney   it's bound to be the next step   he'll post it to someone involved in the hunt   someone he regards as his nemesis   who was driving this van the night before last   i'll have to check  i have my own filing system  it's a bit complex   sir   these were in the van  contact fire investigation   chase up which accelerant was used in the fire   sure   sir   it's for you  dad   have you got his pen  jamie   will you stop   get ready  out   out  everybody out  out   we have two days until he copies the murder of mary kelly   the murder could happen anywhere  the next victim
