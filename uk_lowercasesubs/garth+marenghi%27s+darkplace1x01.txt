traveller  i'm garth marenghi  horror writer   most of you will know me from my extensive canon of chillers  including afterbirth in which a mutated placenta attacks bristol   back in the 1980s  i wrote  directed and starred in garth marenghi's darkplace   a tv programme so radical  so risky  so dangerous  so goddamned crazy   that the powers that be became too scared to show it  and gipped me  much in the way women have done ever since they sniffed out my money   only now  in the worst artistic drought in broadcast history   does the channel come crawling back  cap in hand   asking if your humble fabulist could retrieve darkplace from the boxes in his basement  and let it loose on its unsuspecting public  that's you   naturellement  i relented  and spent three hours of my life  knocking together interviews with key players in this historic programme   namely myself and my publisher dean learner   so finally  here is darkplace  for the first time on british tv   it had a brief run in peru     sit back  dim the lights or switch them off if you don't have dimmers   put conventional logic to one side  and enjoy   well  i say enjoy         i'm garth marenghi   author  dream weaver  visionary  plus actor      you are about to enter the world of my imagination   you are entering my darkplace   cheesy   '80s synthesiser music  darkplace  darkplace  darkplace  darkplace  darkplace  darkplace   just leave   funny  that cat just told me to leave   hi  i've come to apply for the doctor's job   i've just graduated from harvard college  yale  i aced every semester and got an a   that

dr sanchez  you're a woman   yes  i hope that's not a problem   not at all  there's plenty of skirt on the ward   this is the 20th after all  welcome to darkplace  liz   my hand   argh   pulsing  argh   argh   argh   argh   argh   whoa  are you all right   not really   i'm one of the few people who've written more books than they've read   i took the novel as far as it could go   inevitably  my imagination made the move to tv   i got a script  read it  scared me senseless  comme d'habitude   and i said to garth   looked straight into his face  never been afraid at holding a man's gaze  it's natural   i said     this is going to be the most significant televisual event since quantum leap      and i do not say that lightly      my name is dr rick dagless  md   i got the call too early to grab a shower   so i had to make do with a quick rinse round key areas   some little missy took a nosedive in reception   some muggins had to haul ass down there and kiss it better   but first  i had to visit a very special friend   is my daddy gonna be all right   your daddy's very sick  champ   is he going to die   we're doing all we can  but i'm not jesus christ  i've come to accept that now   beeping  i've gotta get this   son of a bitch   that's my boss  i've gotta go   they work you too hard here  they should pay you a hero's wage      you're a good kid     and you're a great doctor   never take drugs   dean's not an actor   i warned garth  i said     i'm not an actor      he said   i'll always remember this     that he didn't want an act  he wanted the truth   so here's dean learner  playing thornton reed   not putting on an act  but putting on the truth   we've got a situation  a lass has just cracked her nut and if she croaks  my ass is grass   that was thornton reed  my boss   head of the department  a ball buster  but then  he had to answer to won ton   she's here on won ton's say so  a star pupil and one darkplace has high hopes for   the lucozade seems to have helped  but she says she's having visions   that's dr lucien sanchez  hotshot surgeon  he's a good buddy   is that why you called me in    some dame's banged her bonce      wait  i have more things to say     go on  sorry for the interruption   don't mention it   she's saying something supernatural's going on   this is a place of science  i need panic in the wards like i need a hole in the head   sounds bang up your alley  dag   aren't you an expert in the arcane and black arts   that was a long time ago  got my fingers burnt   argh   you can count me out  reed  it's all voodoo nonsense   ok  you take the reins on this  dag  but make your methods orthodox   don't worry  reed  this sounds routine  i'm sure nothing untoward will happen   i hope he heeds my words   he will  he's the best damn doctor on the wing   he's a wild card      but i'm glad he's in our deck     let's hope he plays a fair hand      he'll come up trumps     if it's not a joker in the pack   sometimes there is   jim   get 2cc of 0 2  saline chloroxide into bed 33   then tell neurology to get their butts in gear with that cardiogram   come on  let's move it  people   dr liz asher   dr rick dagless md      you've heard of me     who in medicine hasn't   don't believe everything you read   welcome to darkplace  i've seen more auspicious starts   i wasn't planning on falling on my fanny  i had a vision  i'm a psychic      and i'm bo derek     no  you're not   you're right  i'm not  i use sarcasm as a defence      i see the past  the present and the future     tough gig   stop being sarcastic   if everyone who'd ever got close to you had died  you'd be sarcastic too   yes  that makes sense   come on  i'll lend you money for a coffee         we ended up going to the staffroom   there's a clean sofa and the coffee's complimentary   when sanchez heard what liz had to say  he nearly split a log   slops   so  you had a vision that something terrible has either happened  is happening   or will happen to a patient in darkplace   that's about the size of it   have you got a name or room number      room 213        that's where renwick is      who's renwick   no one  forget it   i know you're lying to me  but i'm a big girl now   in a year  i'll be a woman  who's renwick      i don't know what you're talking about     yes  you do   you're right  i do   larry renwick was admitted last week   he went axe happy on a trout farm    killed 60 fish      you knew him  didn't you     you really are psychic   yes  watch this   impressive  but don't do that on the ward   so what happened between you and this renwick customer   larry was a colleague of mine when i first started at darkplace   god  he was brainy    and brave   saved my life once  i saved his twice  so i was one up   we made a pact to push each other's minds to the limit and beyond   naturally  we became fascinated with the occult   one night  larry suggested we open the gates of hell in the canteen   i pleaded with him  i said     no  don't     but he insisted   that night we performed the rite and opened the gate   halfway through  i went to fix us both a coke float   by the time i got back  he'd gone insane      aargh     argh   plus  he'd left the gate open and there was evil everywhere   i need a shower   i re closed the gates of hell but darkplace hasn't been the same since   with larry back  it feels like the gates could re open any second  and that's the last thing i need      you're overworked as it is     it'd be a total hassle   i'll help  i'm free on tuesdays and my contract hasn't started yet      this ain't orthodox  liz     since when were you orthodox  rick   that's true   please   all right  i'll pay you  though   you could use the extra pocket money for clothes and make up   i won't let you down   ok  what'd help me most right now is if you whack a brillo round this mug   or it'll stain   sanch  i suggest you and i pay larry a visit  before it's too late  cos it's 8pm now   this is it      you and he were buddies  weren't you     once   listen  when i first joined this hospital  i was solo   you're the first real buddy i ever had   but if you and he wish to be best buddies again  i won't stand in your way   i've got a best buddy   but some shit sticks no matter how hard you scrape  hang back   you got it   aargh   larry   thump  are you all right   i think i'm gonna die   no  you're gonna make it  i'll get help   nurse   first things first  i gotta stop you bleeding   rick  i beg you  kill me   oh  jesus  larry  don't do this to me   i beg ya   it really hurts   i beg ya   forgive me   oh  no    no   soundtrack drowns speech  bye bye  buddy   breathes heavily  i'll get a mop   i have never exploded  but  i know what it would be like   don't ask me how  i just know   i've always just known   i don't know whether someone close to garth had exploded   whether it was a colleague or a pet     but you could tell that scene meant a lot to him   there were tears on set  not from garth    he was strong for the crew   but i wept  i'm not ashamed of that   it's    i suppose  one of the many burdens he has to bear  as an artist  in bringing us this gift   thanks for explaining the situation   i'm gonna give him the rollicking of his life   you used this to treat him   i didn't wanna use that thing  larry was my friend   if that's how you treat friends  imagine how you treat enemies   he's right  dag  what went on in there wasn't by the book   sanch  i thought we were buddies   you're squabbling over this like dogs with meat   i agree with that   this ain't another exploding patient you can sweep under your rug   renwick was a gateway to another dimension   when he exploded that gateway opened   we must shut it again as soon as possible   what  am i holding a crock of shit   is this hospital called st crock of shit   all right  calm down   emotions are running high  what do you suggest  dag   burn what's left of the body    get lost   cool it  or get a knuckle supper   dagless  you're a good doctor but you're also a maverick   who bites the hand that feeds  this hand   i'm not telling his family that we're burning his body to close the portals to another dimension   i just won't do it   this hospital's got a reputation which i intend to keep  i've yet to see any demons on the ward   go make me a pill that cures madness  or i'll kick your ass so hard you'll be able to build a pool in the footprint  understood   as crystal   if the gates of hell do re open  don't say i didn't warn you   i just have and that means you'd be lying   i went for a drive to clear my head  which is why i'm now in the car   i kept thinking about larry and how inconvenient his blowing up had been   maybe the gates to hell had closed once and for all  maybe they hadn't   it was a double edged point   seems like a regular burial  d'you buy this portal to hell deal   i wouldn't say i buy it  let's just say i'm window shopping   and there's a half price sale on weird   larry renwick will be remembered for his wit and laughing eyes     and for being  above all  a good friend     i'm sure we all feel he exploded too young  but the lord moves in mysterious ways   sometimes he'll come in at an angle   other times he can hover    or swoop   sometimes he can come in from beneath    like a worm    or mole   lord  it's his call how he chooses to manoeuvre     aargh   all shout  priest intones a prayer     look out  he's got a gun    no    my baby boy   move aside   that's the mother  rick     gunfire  she grunts   well  that'll stop him     mother sobs  he shouts  sirens wail   dagless was right about burning renwick   i'm going over there to tell him that   i don't know how  rick  but you were right   here   take this  i hate using these things   you'd best go see to the mother  i had to put a cap in her shoulder   tell her    tell her i'm sorry      you did what you had to do     i know  but do tell her i'm sorry   sure  and     thanks  buddy   rick  where are you going   to get some air   to get away   the doors of darkplace were open   not the literal doors of the building   but evil doors  dark doors  doors to the beyond   doors hard to shut because they were abstract and didn't have handles   more like portals  really   from this day on  i'd have to fight these forces of darkness  and deal with the burden of day to day admin   i do not believe that any form of life  be it human  animal or plant   should be hurt in the making of a tv programme   so  i feel very bad about the cat we killed   i dropped a sofa on my cat   it was a write off so i stood on its head   all i do is sit at the typewriter and start hitting the keys   getting them in the right order    that's the trick  that's the trick         garth
