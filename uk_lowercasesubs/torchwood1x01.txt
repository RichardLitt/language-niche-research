it's a fucking disgrace   there you go  i can taste it   oestrogen  definitely oestrogen   you take the pill  flush it away  it enters the water cycle  feminises the fish   goes all the way up into

you've got to concentrate  who did this to you   what did you see  why am i dead  who attacked you   i don't want to be dead  sixty seconds   you've got to think  just focus on me  what was the last thing you saw  i didn't see     i don't know  who killed you  did you see them   i don't know  there was   something behind me   police said one stab wound in the back  so you didn't see anything  no

him he was dead  well  you try it    trust me   like that's gonna work   told the last corpse he was injured   he wasted the whole two minutes screaming for an ambulance   maybe there's no right way of doing it   what do you think   you still up   in here   they said on the news  murder in the city centre  were you there   no  i dunno  nothing to do with me   how come you're still up though  banana boat came round   he was saying he's got plans  he's off again next summer   how come you're not pissed then   no  we had a cup of tea   he's read this thing about diabetes   me and him having

got time  thanks  if   sarah pallister  72  murdered in her front room   rani ghosh  45  murdered in robintree alley   and now john tucker  19  murdered in llangyfelach lane   so far  there's absolutely nothing linking these three victims   apart from the way they died   as far as we can tell  all with the same weapon   a blade  approximately eight inches long  three inches deep   the women were stabbed from the front  but tucker from behind   what does that tell us about the killer   that he's a coward   but those people last night  the people in the car  who were they   what's torchwood  dunno  special ops   yeah  but what does that mean   bet you ten quid they're dna specialists   it's all dna these days  like that csi bollocks   csi cardiff  i'd like to see that   they'd be measuring the velocity of a kebab   thank you break it up   excuse me  it's all sealed off up there  who did that   thought it was you lot  but what's it for  what's happened   said  chemicals or something   hello   sorry  i'm just looking for someone   right  yeah  clever   anyway  i don't know if you saw a man come through here    a tall man  in one of those big sort of military coats   ok

went nationwide   there's about 15 jacks and johns with that surname  none of them's a captain   he could've made it up   the only captain jack harkness on record was american   that's it  he's american  which you forgot to tell me  so who is he   american volunteer  royal air force   vanished off the records  presumed dead  when was that    on the morning of january 21 1941  captain jack

uniform   and he was killed  or at least he was injured   he must've been injured   right in front of me  this man in a mask  sort of lashed out  and     and i've told you  all hospital staff  present

i'd have got there  but it would've been good   there's your pizza  i'd better go  we've gone past that stage   you must've been freezing out there   how long were you walking around  three hours  you could see me   and before we go any further  who the hell orders pizza under the name of torchwood   me  i'm sorry  i'm a twat   that man  at the hospital  that porter  what happened to him   that was real  wasn't it  he was attacked  he's dead  but there's no one gone missing   we took the body  changed the work rota   planted a false witness who saw him leaving the hospital   giving him an alibi for the next 48 hours   so when his body's pulled out of the docks next tuesday night   he's only been missing for three days   he was murdered  yes  and you covered it up  that's my job   and that other man  john tucker  last night in the alleyway   i saw you  and what did you see   you revived him  no   what did you see  you resuscitated him   no  what did you see   you brought him back to life  yeah   who are you   torchwood  what's torchwood  this is torchwood   all around you   and what happens to me  i'm police  constable gwen cooper   you can't do anything   right then  pc cooper       d'you want to come see   see what  you saw the murder   come and see the murderer   go with him   what is torchwood  who are you  what is this place  screeching  what was that  pterodactyl   are you coming   it's all right   it's safe  it's sedated   it's called a weevil   or at least  we call them weevils   we don't know their real name  cos they're not too good at communicating   but we've got a couple of hundred of them in  the city living in the sewers  feeding off the     well  it's the sewers   you can guess   but every once in a while  one of them goes rogue  comes to the surface  attacks   actually  it's been happening more and more and we have no idea why   but it's alien   look into its eyes   there you go   take your time   it was born on a different world  and it's real   owen harper  gwen cooper   doctor  owen harper  thank you   toshiko sato  suzie costello  she's second in command   and this is ianto jones   ianto cleans up after us and gets us everywhere on time  i try my best   and he looks good in a suit  careful  that's harassment  sir   why are you telling me their names   i'm not supposed to know  am i  this is classified  isn't it  way beyond classified   then you shouldn't be telling me  what are you gonna do to me   what d'you imagine  well  i've seen too much   your names and everything  and the weevil  and     you can dump a man in the water and lie about his death   ok  tosh  finish that calibration tomorrow morning   owen  first thing  get a hold of chandler and bell   cos i think they're lying   ianto  if he needs back up  then you'd better be on stand by  suzie   i know it's a pain in the ass   but i need the costing on the glove research  and you're coming with me   i'm getting tired of following you   no you're not  and you never will   stand on here  c'mon  next to me   good night   now  you came in through the front door   let's take the scenic route   but they can see the lift   why aren't they      we're right out in the open  they can see everything   do they look like they can see us  no  but     look at us  we couldn't be any more public  hello   hey  you there  hello   it's called a perception filter  he can sort of see us  but we don't quite register   just like something in the corner of your eye   it only works on this exact spot  step off    hi  nice night   and lo  we are perceived   how does it work  no idea  we know how to use it  not how it happens   but if i were to guess  i'd say that there was  once a dimensionally transcendental chameleon circuit  placed right on this spot which welded its  perception properties to a spatio temporal rift   but that sounds kind of ridiculous    invisible lift  has got more of a ring to it   but if no one can see it when the lift's coming up   there's a bloody big hole in the floor  don't people fall in   that is so welsh  what is   i show you something fantastic   you find fault   i just don't understand    i tell you what i don't understand   you're gonna rattle on with that    how can this be true   what's it gonna take for you people   if you want evidence of aliens   how about that great spaceship hovering over london on christmas day   what about the battle of canary wharf  a cyberman in every home   my boyfriend says it's like a sort of terrorism   like they put drugs in the water supplies    psychotropic drugs  causing mass hallucinations and stuff   yeah  well your boyfriend's stupid  oh  you've met him   so   you catch aliens   yup  you catch aliens for a living   yes  we do  you're an alien catcher  yes  i am  caught any good aliens   tons of 'em  that's hell of a job  sure is   this is so weird   and who are you  then  captain jack harkness   i did some research and there's only one captain jack harkness on record   and he disappeared in 1941  well    that couldn't be me   could it   we don't just catch aliens   we scavenge the stuff they leave behind   find ways of using it  arming the human race for the future   the twenty first century is when it all changes  and you've got to be ready   but who's in charge of you   we're separate from the government  outside the police  beyond the united nations   cos if one power got hold of this stuff   they could use it for their own purposes  but so could you   all alien technology stays on the base  no one's allowed to take anything outside   so go on  then  how the hell did you end up in cardiff   this is torchwood three  torchwood one was london  destroyed in the battle   torchwood two is an office in glasgow  very strange man   torchwood three  cardiff   torchwood four's kinda gone missing  but we'll find it one day   so you just fancied cardiff   there's a rift in space and time running right through the city   the weevils didn't come in a spaceship  they just slip through   all sorts of things get washed up here   creatures  timeshifts  space junk  debris  flotsam and jetsam   sounds like cardiff  yeah   hey  don't knock it  i'm a citizen   but where are you from   all sorts of places   thing is  we could liaise on this     the serial killer  i could be like your liaison with the police   right  i can see the mistake   you think because we showed up we're out to catch the killer   sorry  nothing to do with us  then what were you doing there  testing the glove   we need murder victims  simple as that  the glove only works on the recently deceased   and the more violent the trauma  the stronger the resurrection   all we need is fresh meat   no  you were asking that man   john tucker  i saw you  you were asking him about his killer   he'd just been murdered   what else are you gonna ask  you could get an id  you could help   we're busy  and your work is more important  now you've got it   well  that's tough shit   cos if you let me go  then i have a duty  cos that glove could help us   if you remember  what d'you mean   how's your drink   have you poisoned me  don't be so dramatic  it's an amnesia pill   my own recipe  with a touch of denial and a dash of retcon   wake up tomorrow morning  you'll have forgotten everything about torchwood   worse still  you'll have forgotten me       which is kind of tragic   don't think you can fight it by staying awake   i mixed in a little bit of sedative too   then i'll tell someone  d'you really want us to come and find them too   you bastard  language   nice knowing you  gwen cooper   hello  all right   you having a good time  i was  can i buy you a drink   no  thanks  i'm fine   am i wasting my time   i dunno  are you   i've got to be up early and i've got hell of a day  tomorrow and i can't be bothered with all the chat   so   do you want a drink or what   bloody hell fire  you're coming home with me  you are  right now   oi  you bastard  come here  linda  what the fuck do you think you are doing    i'm taking him home and i'm having him  now piss off   what the fuck d'you think you're doing with my girlfriend  hey   she was on her own  she never said   you fucking tosser  colin  button it  he's mine   do you want to have a go  you want to have a go  come on then mate  well   if it makes it easier     i am so having you   i'm having him first  taxi   did you get pissed  no   what time is it   seven thirty   you said you were working last night  i was   then how come you fell asleep in here   i haven't  i was   typing   that is work   i'm not having a go  i'm just saying   not exactly clever going out on the lash when you've just had a bang on the head   i hope you didn't drive in that state  who were you with  diane   must've been  yeah   have any luck  with what   captain jack harkness   how d'you mean  who's he  oh   well don't worry about me  just go ahead  wasting my time   aye  aye  come to see where the real work's done   yes  sir  that's right  sir  how's it going  sod all   is that the murder weapon  clever  mind  they worked it all out on a computer   took measurements from the stab wounds  calculated the shape of the blade and stuff   even those prongs   i don't know how they do it   nasty looking beast  though   d'you recognise it  no  we're trying to trace it  can't be that many of 'em   sort of ornamental  we're checking the cde  logs with customs in case it's been imported   find the knife  we might find the killer   anyway  if it rings any bells  give's a shout  yeah  thanks     i said to geoff  it's not demotion being put in goal   it's vital  but was he having any of it   he's off and moaning  says  who  and all the time  he's wheezing away   and i'm like  geoff  you're proving my point mate      you never come down  you're in charge of transport     i said   mam  i can't go hopping on a truck    all that christmas stuff  all over again  i was like  for god's sake  leave it     hello again  you were right   you told jack we should liaise with the police  i was the only one who bothered   so i was the only one who saw the report   they got a good likeness  i'm arresting you for     how do i know you  i thought you saw it   and that can trip the amnesia  one image  if you're clever   he said you were good   anyway  it's not much good now  i can't really     but you're gonna put up a fight  so i've got     um  hold on  sorry   there  that's better   put it down  you had to come back  put down the gun   you're the only one who can make the link  well  the only one in public   torchwood's gonna find out by morning  but i'll be gone   i don't know where  far away   what am i gonna do   i loved this job  i really loved it   and now i've got to run   oh  christ   how can you do any other job after this one  please   put down the gun  cos it gets inside you   you do this job for long enough  and you end up thinking    how come we get all the weevils and bollocks and shit    is that what alien life is  filth   but maybe there's better stuff out there  brilliant stuff   beautiful stuff  just     they don't come here   this planet's so dirty  that's all we get   the shit   i don't know what you're talking about  i wish i could forget   why did you kill those people  for the glove  stay where you are   i needed the bodies  that's how it works  violent death   and it was so easy  to bring them back   i'd position myself behind the head  so they'd never see me twice   you killed three people  it was the only way   the more i use the glove  the more i control it  i don't understand  what glove   if i can get enough practice  then think what that glove could do   if i could get it work all the time   on anything  beyond the two minutes  if it could work permanently   it could resurrect   resurrection on demand for the whole world  isn't that good   isn't it though  well  that's what i've been working for  all day and all night   the rest of them go swanning about  but i'm working   you've got to get inside this stuff  surrender yourself to it   i did  with the knife  and the glove   and that's why the perception filter isn't gonna work on me   where did he come from   what have you done   please don't  i can't let you go   please  i've got to   i'm sorry   don't  don't  don't   i've got to  i've got to  i've got to   put down the gun   susie  it's over  now  come with me   i remember  i remember   i remember   owen and toshiko  you didn't tell them that you were shot in the head and survived   you didn't tell them either  followed my lead   keep doing that  and you might just get through this   but she killed you   i can't die   ok  but i can't   something happened to me a while back  long story  and far away   but i was killed   and then i was brought back to life  and ever since then     i can't die   but how  i don't know   one day  i'll find a doctor   the right sort of doctor and maybe he can explain it  but until then     nothing kills you   kind of freaks people out  so     best if you don't say anything   it doesn't matter anyway   you'll only wipe my memory again  why would i do that   torchwood's got a vacancy   job going spare  do you want it   but what d'you need me for   cos maybe you were right   we could do more to help   what d'you think  d'you want to join up  yeah   i do  yes
