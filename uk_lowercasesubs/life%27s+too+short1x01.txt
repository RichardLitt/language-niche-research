   1  my name is warwick davis   i'm the uk's go to dwarf   i'm an actor  you will have seen me in the harry potter films   hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy   return of the jedi   yup yup   that's wicket the ewok  my first ever character   i'm still very good friends with george lucas   who created the star wars films   though if i've got one criticism of george  he missed a trick   why did he disguise my face   if you're paying good money for the actor warwick davis   then let the people see the actor warwick davis   george realised the error of his ways  because he went on to cast me in willow there   that film cost  i think it's 40 million   and has    has made a lot of that back  since   phone rings  hello  dwarves for hire  warwick davis speaking   'i am not only an actor '  yep  just get a booking form   'i'm also an agent '  i represent other dwarves   you know  i've had huge success   and this is my chance to pay that forward and help them get work   the director's furious  he wants to fire you   not my fault i don't know the song  you're a dwarf  how can you not know  hi ho    something about whistling  whistle while you work  never heard it   how is this possible  i don't know   that's one of my clients there   so if you need anybody  i've got all sorts   got that sort of look   that one  one that looks like that   someone who looks like that   you know  with a hat on  some with long hair   all sorts of different ones   i mean  they're all about that high   but they've sort of got different     fat  thin  you know  whatever you want   i can provide   why am i doing this documentary   because normally you see a dwarf on tv   and he's dancing around  making a fool of himself   i want people to see a sophisticated dwarf about town  who carries himself with dignity   i'm a role model   i'm a bit like martin luther king   because i too have a dream  that one day dwarves will be treated equally   and they will walk proud  hand in hand with the rest of mankind   you say   no  warwick  it's not the same   the dwarf wasn't taken forcibly from his homeland  and enslaved and whipped and forced to change his name    no  maybe not   but then  i've never seen a black man fired from a cannon     every day for a whole season and twice on saturdays   there we go  come in   the old homestead   yeah   oh  don't worry  they're not mine   who's this handsome devil   nice suit there   that's me and my wife sue on our wedding day   sue's looking lovely there   the dress she's wearing belonged to her mother   her mother had sadly passed over   so it was our way of having her at the wedding  which was nice   sue had to lose a lot of weight to get it on   not as much as i'd have liked   but enough to squeeze into her dead mum's dress   this is my kitchen  cooker  sink  usual   i was going to get all this lowered  but sue enjoys doing the cooking  so i thought i'd leave it  erm  good   here we are  look  this is chewbacca  hey  chewie   good boy  ho ho

phone hasn't rung for years   but if it started ringing   if george lucas rang and said we're doing another star wars  i had to be ready to go  on a plane  whoosh  here i come   if that had happened  i could have come with you   no  cos george lucas isn't stupid  doesn't throw his money around    why do you need two tickets  you're only three foot six    tell you what happened  oh  what   he thought    here we go  what did i think  mystic meg here   what he thought was    yeah  yeah  he thought he could do better   he thought he could trade me in for a taller  more beautiful model   but

going   oh  he's got the sexy bird cos he's a film star    right  so i went for a chick who    hasn't got it all out on show   yeah  she's not going to be in fhm magazine   she's not going to win any rear of the year awards  or turn heads at an awards do  or a showbiz party   or in the supermarket  but she's reliable   she won't run to the papers    know what warwick likes sexually  he likes      it doesn't matter what warwick likes sexually   whatever it is  she won't write about it in her memoirs   not that anyone'd ask her for her memoirs   cos she's a nobody  as i said before   can't reach

business   'when the phone won't stop ringing you can be choosy   'but when it's not ringing   'then    it's at times like this'  when you find out who your friends are  and you call in a few favours   'i'm good friends with ricky gervais and stephen merchant  when you're friends  'with writers  directors  producers   'then what's wrong with saying   all right  chaps  what's going on '   have you

you working on at the minute  just other tv and film   ok  and  you know     any actors required  perhaps   actors   do you need actors   we will need actors for the  um  at some point   but not necessarily    not     not     if we do  though  we would like     yeah  cos you were brilliant in the office  extras   extras  yeah  whatever   we did have someone like that in the office  though   wheelchair  we had a wheelchair one   same ballpark  oh  yeah   but  um    no  ok  well   remember me when you're writing   definitely  oh  yeah   oh  yeah  you know i mentioned  things weren't so good between myself and my wife   well  recently  it took a turn for the worse  i'm afraid   she's going through with a divorce  i don't know what went wrong   always delivered in the bedroom department  i think  you know   um     no  it's    you know   several times a week   which is unusual  i think   this far into a marriage  what was it  ten years almost  yeah   but um  always had a good go   ah  that's     that's the main thing  innit   i want to tell you this  ricky   i always took care of her needs before i moved on to mine   ricky clears throat  i could tell you some of the things we did   no  no point   it's just    it's  um     no  i could take your word for it   all a bit sad really   yeah   right  um   good to see you chaps  it is  always nice to see you  cheers   thanks for coming  see you soon  ok   oh  yeah  just one more thing  go on   just getting back to the divorce situation  i wondered   have you got any advice   um  well   my advice would be  ask steve  cos he's great at that sort of    thing   about what   just the divorce   the divorce thing  you know  it's all new to me so i don't know what to     my advice would probably be just to  um   do whatever you think is the right thing to do in this situation   what good advice that is   do whatever  yeah   you agree with that  yeah   if steve says so  yeah   just do whatever  ok  yeah   all right  chaps  cheers  are you definitely off  see you  bye   do whatever   what do i know  i didn't even realise he was married  oh  god   erm    well  that went well   it's always good to get their perspective on things   and  you know  now i'm in their minds for any future     shaun   shaun williamson  from extras   hello  what are you doing here  then   oh  just seeing the boys about a few things   so they are doing more extras   i don't know  i'm just returning their dry cleaning  oh   doing a few errands for 'em  you know  yeah   it's all cash and just  you know  it keeps me busy   gets me out the house  so  um     work's dried up a bit since extras  to be honest  yeah  same here   what is this  then   documentary   what  about     about me  yeah   that's good exposure for you  that's what i thought   it's all good   see you later  yeah  see you later  yeah   buzzer rings  'hello '  right  what was i saying   'oh  hi  come up '  yeah  now i'm in their minds for any future work and stuff   cos they're always writing and er  and producing stuff   so they're the people to know   cheryl wilkins  that's you   bit of background on me before we start   i'm an entrepreneur   and hoping to expand my operation here   that's partly why i need new staff   also  my wife used to work here  but she's currently going through a divorce situation  with me   so um  so i need a new secretary   which could be you   i'm looking at your cv  and i see  not a lot of experience   no  that will mean i can't pay you a lot initially   that's fine  mum just wants me out the house   i can live rent free if i don't come home till six at night   right   what are your interests  you know  tell me a bit about cheryl   do you have a pet  i've got two pets that are related to each other   they're dogs  ah   but we sort of call them  different things  like   they've got names   oh  yeah  obviously  they're dogs   and you've given them names   which is not unusual  i don't think you'll find  it's just     ok  what are your hopes for the future   sales and marketing   and that's it  that's your dream   no  my dream is to sort of establish  that people that go to the moon are actually going to the moon  and they're not just pretending   i've got a few more people to see   actually there's no one else to see  you're hired   yeah  we do have people that can do leprechauns   how many do you want   'being restricted in height does not make you restricted in talent '  i wouldn't go for seven  cos seven tends to make people think dwarves   if they're meant to be leprechauns i'd go with six or eight   there's loads of little people with immense talent   and that's what i'm trying to show the world   duet      ebony and ivory          live together in perfect harmony         can i be honest   um    awful  obviously   that's the least of our worries   a lot of boxes ticked  we've got dwarves   blacking up  and you know   i may be wrong but i don't think you can do that any more   maybe in the north  so  we've got dwarves   blacking up  singing  ebony and ivory   it's a very mixed message   and i'm a lesbian   i didn't even know one of you was a girl   so  here we are at the offices of my accountant  yep   eric  biddle  mr biddle   yeah  he's not only my accountant  he's a friend   yeah  we go way back  don't we   um    long way  yeah  years and years  isn't it   it smells a bit iffy in here today   it's like something rotting  you know that smell of    is it that   oh  what is it   it's a chicken  i had it for lunch   when  about a week ago   then empty the bloody bin   it's not my job to empty the bins   i'm an accountant  not a bloody cleaner   right   have you spoken to the inland revenue  what's the latest   yes  they are not pressing charges   they don't think it's fraud  i've told them you didn't know what you were doing   it's you who didn't know what he was doing  you're my accountant   you're supposed to tell me if i owe tax  yeah  i know  but     the original figure they said i owed was 250 000  where are we now   well  i was cheeky  i said   he won't do it again    there was a bit of back and forth   and the figure i arrived at was   50 000     50 000  that's great   wait  no  they said no to that   a very definite no   so what was the figure you agreed on     250 000   that's what they wanted to start with  yes  but     that's not negotiating  you just agreed with them   but the tax people know what they're talking about   they understand your accounts better than me   i'm not going to argue with them   you're supposed to argue  and piss off the inland revenue   i've got other clients to think of  better clients   i don't want them tarred by your bloody mistakes   that you made  yeah  exactly   'i've known eric for about 25 years now '  he wanted to be a top accountant  i wanted to be a hollywood star   i have to earn   250 000 by january   more actually   cos you have to pay 40  tax on what you earn  so     i never realised  back then  what a poor accountant he would become   hang on  i'm confused  sorry   am i being thick  no  no  it is confusing   tax  percentages and everything   i always get stuff wrong  i get letters   and the smell makes it hard to concentrate  to be honest   he really is shit at it   how much do i need to earn   let's have a look  250 000  times     calculator whirrs  oop  er  times     does this do percentages   it should do  where is it  ah  there   now  do i press times percentage   'if he wasn't a mate  i'd have fired him 24 years ago  but   '   'he is a mate  and i can't fire him '  is 0 4 the same  isn't that like saying 40  of something   'in fact  he's more like a stray dog than a mate'  cos i've been feeding him for so long   you know  i can't stop now   cos if i do  i know he'll just sit outside  waiting  and    and starve to death   pounds   then pay the tax on that   um    pay off the 250 grand   and you'll be left with      20 000   i'd have 20 grand  i can live on that   that's not so bad    hang on   didn't higher rate tax go up from 40  to 50  in the uk recently   gee  ohh     ohhh     wuh wuh buh buh buh     can i ask you something  warwick   how do you keep getting into this office   'the great thing about being friends with influential people  'is that through them  you get to meet other influential people '  i mean if either of you  or both  could come along   it'd really help  i can't     'that's how this business operates  it's all about networking '  you'd enjoy it  i wouldn't  trust me   buzzer rings warwick  you've got to go   hello  'it's liam neeson '  come in  i've worked with him  ok  but you've got to go  sorry  guys   door closes  i could just     there is he  hello   hi  that's warwick  he's just going   hiya  we worked together on star wars  phantom menace   oh yeah  we had a scene together   it was cut  though  remember  ok   thanks for seeing me   i'm here because i'm thinking of  uh   i'm thinking of doing some comedy   oh  right like a comedy movie   no  on stage   stand up comedy  live comedy of some kind   wow   i'm a funny guy   aren't i   i'm funny  right   yeah   definitely   here's some of the stuff i'd like to work on   improv  stand up comedy   funny monologues   crazy characters  sketches   slapstick  anecdotes  parody  yeah   yeah   you notice this list  huh  i'm always making lists   oh  right   in fact  that's probably why steven spielberg cast me  as oskar schindler in schindler's list   i said   steven  i make lists all the time    and he said   that's exactly what i'm looking for    what  what's funny   sorry  i thought you were joking  about being cast as schindler cos you made lists   no   as an actor  you need stuff to draw on   and i drew on that   ok  wow   ok  let's do some improvisational comedy   i can't now  liam  it's a bad time     let's do some improvisational comedy  now   ok     give us a scenario  warwick   um  right  ok  er     you're a hypochondriac and ricky's a doctor   excellent   ok   knock knock  come in   hello  oh no  not you again   i've never been here before   sorry  i thought     as you're a hypochondriac  you'd have been to the doctor before   don't presume  that's a backstory we didn't agree on beforehand   no  i know   but that's improv  you go with the flow  i don't take notes   ok   can we go again  because you ruined that  sorry   knock knock  come in   hi  hi  how's it going  what seems to be the problem   i've contracted aids   how did you get that  from an african prostitute   i'm    i'm riddled with it   the prostitute's from an african country that's   that's ravaged by starvation  so     so selling her body was the only financial recourse she had left   do you mind if i interject  go on   i think it's getting quite heavy  this sketch   and i just wonder if perhaps  just for the sake of comedy   you might not want to have contracted aids  from an african prostitute  just     ok   all right   knock knock   come in   hi  hi  what seems to be the problem   as i said before  i've got full blown aids  right   do you want to know how i got it  sure   from a well known homosexual actor   wow  ok   it was    i wouldn't say the name  cos of     i got it from an unspecific actor   does he know he has aids  who     again  sorry  i just wouldn't name them  and also  i just think  aids is  as i've said before  just a really heavy subject for comedy   ah  ok   hmm   i could have bowel cancer   yeah   cancer though  and aids  and famine   aren't really subjects for comedy  how does he get away with it  then   we don't know   we shouldn't have a doctor in the sketch  if i can't talk about aids  ok   any suggestions   oh  um    you're a greengrocer  and ricky comes in to complain   i've played rob roy macgregor  michael collins  oskar schindler   zeus  for god's sake   no one will believe me as a grocer  change your accent   lots of actors do it  he doesn't  how does he get away with it   again  we don't know   let's just do our own accents and get this done  shall we   ok  greengrocer   tring   we're closed   i think the shop has to be open for us to do the sketch  ok  sorry   tring   yes   um  i'd like to make a complaint   i bought some fruit yesterday  when i got home  some of it was rotten   that's not my fault   well  it's your shop and it was sold on your premises  so     uh uh  i wasn't here   doesn't matter  you've got to    i was at the doctor's  ok   i've got aids  thought you might have   yep  that's it  that's really good   yeah  you're going to storm it  boy   ok  brilliant  good luck with that  well done   don't forget your little list  yeah   you're off as well  aren't you  warwick   oh  yeah  yeah  ok  see you guys   ok  all right  cheers   everything that happens  happens for a reason   some things are sent to test you   i'm not the sort of bloke who lives in the past  who goes    oh  i wish it was still the 1980s  those were the glory days   i was doing willow  return of the jedi  work was rolling in    i'm not like that   i'm going to list all the positives   i'm not destitute   not a drug addict   not riddled with aids   and there was a chance of catching that in the '80s   from a woman   right  if i'd caught it from anyone it would have been a woman   but  to be honest  i wasn't really shagging in the '80s   in the '90s  i dipped my wick a few times   so watch this space   plenty more wick dipping to come   in women  just want to make that totally clear   i'm not a homosexual   so  where are you staying   just probably a guest house   you got everything   yeah  you got your special shampoo   yes   don't worry  it's almost cleared up anyway   so  yeah   ok  well  bye   see you  see you   lovely day   do you want to go into the toilet with me   you getting all this  fuck off   would you be guest of honour at our wedding   do you believe in aliens   be grateful the phone doesn't ring  it might be sting   his real name's gordon   you're a disgusting little creature and i want to squash you   he can't afford a solicitor  i'm his accountant   give me a kiss   hmm     she's changed the locks   she's changed the back door too   what were you thinking   i was thinking  i put over   400 000 into this house  and  er  the dog  bless it   has contributed very little to the mortgage  yet  it can come and go as it pleases   and i thought  i'll have a bit of that
