little girl   i'm not a pervert  i'm not a nonce   i'm not going back on the wing   i want to stay here in health care where it's safe   all my life  everyone's always picked on me   you don't have to do that  tanya's away for another week yet   matt  don't come in here   the air's like neat chianti   i must've done close on my entire week's worth of alcohol last night   and i'm feeling every drop of it   i'm consoling myself at least i didn't  pick a fight and weep  and then insist on driving home   can't imagine you doing that   ah  be thankful you don't know me better   don't worry  i won't make a habit  of failing to get home   it's all right   sarah  i went on a bit  iast night  didn't l     sorry    rosie  dad   um     i don't take it personally   she's been through a lot   yeah   i wish i knew     i know  i know   i just want her to stop having the nightmares  and tell me what happened   daddy   there are worse things     than not knowing   not to me   our illustrious leader was late for his own wedding  did you know that   no  bet she made him pay for it   she still is  by the look of his suits   they're made to measure  just not for him   that charity shop look is just so last season   poor old sod   don't you start being kind  the shock might kill him   barclay  leave me a message    and i'll get back to you           bloody hell  guv  just in time     england v  india     morning    morning   i will of course share my findings with you  before my written report goes to the assistant chief constable   anything i discover outside my terms of reference i'll report to you verbally   on the third day we recovered the little girl  apparently unharmed   apart from the effects of the hay fever medication  she'd been given to keep her quiet   no evidence of sexual assault   we charged kyle betts  a local man   with kidnapping and false imprisonment   he was remanded in custody  and there he remains   there's no evidence to link him to the disappearance of the mother   you moved rather quickly to a murder inquiry on her     dragged there reluctantly    no body  though  no forensic     correct    so i'm still not clear on what evidence  you changed your hypothesis from missing person to murder   detective superintendent barclay   sir  this is your 28 day review   it's not optional   it's not voluntary   i've been assured by your a c c   that i will receive your full cooperation   and i intend to get it   i'm here to help    sir     explain your current hypothesis  please   tell me what you think happened to leanne   i haven't got the faintest idea   that's why i'm investigating    to find out what happened to her   and i'm not gonna make something up  just to fit in with anybody else's  textbook idea of how it should be done       mommy didn't send you a birthday card     did she    no   no  she didn't     i expect she forgot    yeah   yeah  i expect so too   you're not worrying about me  are you   you stop it right now  i'm the daddy  okay   i do the worrying   and we're all right  aren't we  big boy   eh     daddy          ethan      barbara  yoo hoo   where's the birthday boy   ah  there you are   happy birthday    matthew  darling     thanks    oh  look   daddy hasn't opened his cards   well  don't worry  i'm not gonna open them for you   ethan  come in here a minute   look  look what your clever granddad's made     can we light the candles    'course we can  go and get rosie   i'm sorry it's just me  but getting john out of the house     i made him an appointment for a haircut  and i've told him if he doesn't go   i'll take the nail scissors to him   i just found myself  sitting there waiting for the postman   and i thought   this is    this is pathetic  it's just    it's just denial  it's just      don't  please don't lose it now  i need your support   i can't have you caving in on me too   oh  matt  i'm so angry with the police   playing god   what right have they   how dare they just decide she's dead   now where has naughty mommy    hidden the matches    go and watch telly  you two     but  daddy  i want cake    now   i don't know what to believe   i wish i did   i wish i knew one way or the other   her father's abandoned her  you've abandoned her   even the newspapers have lost interest  and here am l   i gave birth to her   i'm the only one who has any faith left  we can't get used to this   we mustn't start thinking this is our life now   it's getting better  but i still can't say he really confides in me   i'm the only black officer on the team  and he knows that   and he thinks i've been put in as family liaison to winkle stuff out of him        yeah  well  he's obviously not stupid   not a suspect  either   mr  barclay hasn't designated a suspect   but it makes no difference because matt still feels like it's him   you know what i'm asking you  simone   sarge  there's no prejudice against him here  because he's black   he's the husband  right   he's    the husband   and it's his birthday  so     yeah  it'll be the usual  creeping around  sniffing everyone's bum   after which they'll tell us   ta da   what we already know   which will make for a short report  'cause we know sod all   it's just routine  amy   nothing to be scared of     might turn up something we've missed      yeah  and another thing   why does the review always have to be done  by some arrogant  slimy graduate plastic   i tick most of those boxes   yeah  well  at least you're not smug with it     or lrish   and don't tell me he's only doing his job  his only job in my life  today is to give me someone to hate more than i hate you  guv   kyle betts went all name rank and serial number on us  sir   he wouldn't tell us a thing about why he took the little girl   wouldn't even talk about his little cigarette smuggling scam   okay  this is him  the flower seller   i arrested him on suspicion of abduction   branko lazarov  who says     he saw nothing  heard nothing and it wasn't him  it was his brother   originality's not his strong point   branko got the ass with us  sir   it being a sunday  he lost a day's trade  waiting for us to track down a macedonian interpreter   he was never gonna help us out   you arrested him on suspicion of abducting leanne   but the little boy didn't pick him out   well  ethan's only seven  and he was a long way away  and anyway    so we released him  obviously   still a hell of a lot of searches here on keywords  relating to the former yugoslavia   we've got a statement from a lorry driver that puts branko lazarov  in the lay by at the right time   eastern europeans and smuggling go together  right   and matthew wellings saw active service in the war in the former yugoslavia   mr  barclay put that all together and judged  we should give this line of enquiry the highest priority   clearly you don't agree with him   this team has spent a lot of time  pursuing it  sir  and a lot of money   um     there's no evidence to support any link     ethan  look at me    shut up     look at me  i'm the mommy now    mommy's dead  silly   she's not dead  she's asleep   get off me  get off   ow   just a quick whiz around     oh  now what     rosie  give it to me    ethan  let go     stop doing that   shut up  shut up  shut the fuck up       morning    do something with him  will you  i can't   simone  oh  that's nice  this one's from tanya in france   postmark   um  mount pleasant   and a british stamp   okay  so grandmother organized it in advance  right   that's thoughtful   barbara's always been very kind to me   this big one is from  all at the gym    there's a lot of kisses in that one   this is just a bill   uh    oh  it's leanne's   hang on   tanya's trip to france   didn't her granddad pay for that   that's right  why  what's up   you think you know someone  you think you know everything about them   i've been mourning her for a month  going through hell  and     maybe     maybe she was planning to leave me   see the last transaction  it's on the day she disappeared   frank's air travel  do you see  guv   so leanne used up a lot of her loyalty points to buy a one way ticket to toulouse   for the same flight that tanya flew out on  when she went to visit her father a fortnight ago   there was no bloody sign    of leanne when i got there    she didn't actually go  jim   don't get that face on   you went through all her credit cards and bank statements   it's not your fault you missed this  it's just a bloody loyalty card   jim  jim   look  we know matt and leanne had been arguing    money  the stepdaughter  the bloody dog  i don't know   why is it so hard to believe that  leanne decided to take tanya  go back to the ex husband and matt found out       for god's sake    sarge  is matt a suspect now     not until mr  barclay says so    well  i need to know   i'm the one who has to deal with him   is it because he's black   an investigation is a search for the truth   and we can only go where the evidence leads us     that is not enough    you're right  it isn't   that's because we've been running round like blue assed flies after macedonians   there's a link  i know there is   tanya saw matt in the shopping mall  around about the time that leanne disappeared   we don't know where he went after that  or her   or what happened to her when she got there   amy     we don't even know if she's dead     i'm asking you again   are you under pressure from upstairs  to go hands off with matt wellings 'cause he's black   no   is that no as in  no   or no as in  no no no no   yes     in a situation like this   we have to be double plus sure of our grounds   the moment i designate matt wellings a suspect    then we have to arrest him and caution him and bring him in for questioning   and i still don't see what's wrong with that   what's wrong is that i'm the senior investigating officer  and i make the decisions     ames  what's going on  are we searching again   review team's big idea   apparently we should have crawled up a few storm drains   i suppose it would be childish of me to hope they don't find anything   hey   where are you off to   oh  the guv'nor wants me to have another word with my snitch   oh  go on  tell mommy  who is it   any covert human intelligence source is strictly on a need to know basis     all right    yeah yeah yeah   well  he doesn't seem to want to talk about it and i don't see how i can make him   i mean  christ  if the boot was on the other foot    if you really thought it was spying  gary   you wouldn't have helped us out already  would ya   i don't know why you're bothering with matt anyway   when you've already got that sad little wannabe locked up   the times i had kyle betts sitting in my office  dribbling on about wanting to join the army   we're not that desperate   all i need to know is what matt really thought about leanne and her ex   yeah  i mean  you two have been shot at together in yugoslavia   if anyone can get it out of him  you can   he's always played his cards close to his chest  has matt   always been prickly   he never wanted to talk  even when bad stuff happened    coming under fire  and the horrible things you see     yeah    look  he always said    talking about it won't make it stop   it's pointless talking about it    not like you then   hind leg donkey combo me  mate  yeah    you're out of here soon  aren't ya     what  the end of the month    mmm     you got another job lined up    have you seen what they're paying  on civvy street   well  you know there's a drink in this for you  gary   how big a drink depends on the quality of the information  all right     hi  this is leanne  sorry we can't take your call at the moment   but please leave a message and we'll call you back     thanks  bye      hi  matt  it's gaz   i thought i might pop around later if you  uh    if you fancy a beer or something   you been on your holidays then   uh  no  not this year   oh  you want to get yourself in the sun  put a smile back on your face   my dad's retired and he's never here   i'm like   that's my fortune you're spending  that is   you'd see your only daughter starve  innit     i wonder if you'd mind awfully not talking to me   oh  sorry    here  over here   would you excuse me a minute     quick   quick  he's leaving   oh  i'm really sorry  mr  poole  i'm sorry   i didn't know who you were  i just   i didn't know   it's all right  you weren't to know  you weren't to know   oh god  i feel awful now  oh god   i'm so sorry   oh  we're all sorry   i mean everyone is so bloody sorry   john  i thought  if i don't get out of here right now  i'm going to cry   people     it's almost as though they think it's catching   grief is catching  death is catching   and they mustn't get too close  or     it'll happen to them too   i had neighbors cross the road  to avoid me  when barbara's mother died   and cancer isn't catching either  last time i checked   i was hoping you might have a word with her   with barbara   she's hanging on very hard to the idea that leanne is alive somewhere   and  um  there's no reasoning with her   yeah yeah   i know  it's all my fault   i had to have my flowers  i had to have my cigarettes   now stop all this  vic   all of us going on and on about how guilty we feel and it doesn't help   won't bring leanne back  there's even poor little tanya blaming herself  because she wasn't in the car with leanne that day   as if a 13 year old girl    i do not like the idea of that child  traveling to france on her own   she goes every year  and she's not on her own  is she  she's with her father     she has to see her father    yes  yes   daf bloody parry   she could have gone to university   leanne   she could've made something of her life   you should've locked her up  john  i know i would've   i would have killed rather than let her marry that waster   oh  come on   how's the new one any better  hmm   matt wellings   raised in the gutter  still doesn't have a pot to piss in   pardon my french   you don't think that he's got anything to do with it  do you  john   no   i don't know   barbara thinks the sun shines out of his backside   why do all the women in my family have such terrible taste in men   i'm not the bloke to ask that  am l     sorry   you all right in here  vic   not really   not anymore   you see  hazel's the only person here  among all these silly tarts that one could talk to   i told her that  i wasn't gonna blame her for what her son did   but she won't give me the time of day now   oh  love  i wish you'd told me bef    don't fuss  for god's sake  pretending you care   there are men in here that's done rapes  and murders and everything you can think of   did their mothers turn them in   you're gonna have to stop denying this  love   mom  i swear i only stopped to look at the dog   how long are you gonna keep this up   eh  what you gonna do   are you going to tell the judge and the jury  that you mistook someone else's child for a puppy   doesn't matter how hard i try  does it  mom   i'll always be a disappointment to you   all his life he's just never fitted in  and he tries ever so hard        look  there's no easy way to say it   i just don't feel comfortable about the idea   it'd make the world of difference to him   we used to have one just like that when he was little   that's   that's scooter  she's a real character   and kyle loved her  he never hurt her   excuse me   he's  uh  not so little now  is he   there's a lot of very weird people  out there  mrs  betts   which is why there's a lot of sad   hurt and lonely dogs in here   hey    hey  scooter  scooter   would you like to come home with me  would you   no no  i'm sorry  mrs  betts   but the answer's still no   besides  why on earth would they let him out   john  why do you keep wanting to defend him   you washed those sheets yourself when tanya went to france   probably just dog hairs  you're always clearing up after a dog   come on  he's had someone staying there   you'd have got there 10 minutes earlier  you'd probably have seen her leave   don't say anything today  john  no arguments today   it's his birthday  the children     and even if you're right  at least we know they haven't slept with each other   not yet     gaz   little feller let me in   i think he's grown since last week   blink and they grow an inch   who'd have thought the sight of your ugly mug  would be the best thing to happen to me on my birthday   i've been trying to call you all day  here   ethan   come in  give me a minute     let's have one of those hugs we've been saving for mommy   i'm sorry i shouted at you  okay   yeah     daddy      hmm   rosie says that mommy's asleep   he carries it around with him in case she phones   let's have one of those beers quick before his grandparents get here   i'd better go  actually   but you've only just got here   no  i'd better  you know   your family coming and everything     yeah   i keep thinking    it's my birthday   she's got to come home today    find     thank you   come on  then  blow with me as hard as you can   don't forget to make a wish   okay   barbara  now how about giving daddy his new phone back  before that gets lost too   it's really generous  thank you   this'll have to be my last  amy     wife forgotten what you look like      i heard about you and your husband   well  you can bin the sorry face  'cause you never liked him     probably just trying to get my leg over    oh  happy days   anyway  you can't leave till i get you drunk enough  to give me a hint what's in your report   we'll be reporting  to detective superintendent barclay   mmm  barclay's banker the wanker   he's as mad as a hat  you know  the poor old sod   word to the wise  amy   d i  laverty does not like disloyalty   hello   he likes to take a good look at the atmosphere on the team   good lord  is that the time  and me with a cat to feed   how long before you retire  amy   counting the days   this job chews you up  spits you out   and never a word of thanks     amy  i would've been here earlier   but i had to leave the bloody car  in the bloody pub carpark   and the taxi had absolutely no idea how to find this place     well  why     he'd still be pouring it down my neck   but i told him i had to get home for the cat   and no  of course i don't have a cat  bloody thing would starve   for god's sake  what you been doing in here  belly dancing   well  don't knock it  it's top of the pops in egypt       so did he give you anything    nothing useful   my alleged mate on the search team  never rang me either   so i rang her   and then i went and checked  what she told me    in the files   could you try to enjoy this a little bit less   matt wellings lost a mobile phone   and i think they've found it   now are you gonna tell me that he lost it by accident     sure you don't want us to stay    gonna have an early night   not much of a birthday  sat here on your own   i'll be fine   thanks for coming     wouldn't hurt to make a bit of an effort    oh  for    oh  you never liked him   gonna try and stay in your own bed tonight   okay   night night   dad    leave the door open   i know     sorry  i know it's late   i just knocked off work   brought the new timetables  so you can have a look  see what shifts you want   thanks   can't we go inside and talk   no   look  don't take this the wrong way  danielle   but something like this happening   it makes you realize what's really important   that'll be why you're shagging mrs  well up herself posh bitch   i'm not  i love my wife  i don't want anyone else   you know what  matt  if you were a girl  you know what the boys would call you   prick tease   i'm sorry if you got the wrong idea   but there was never gonna be anything more than friendship between us   oh  and that'll be why you're shagging mrs  well up herself posh bitch     i'm not  you're wrong     fuck you     matt  no no  sarah  she's not stalking me   put me in a gym with a couple of really fit black guys   and danielle wouldn't give me a second look   it's only 'cause i'm the only one   most of the boys in the children's home were white   so when i was very little   i thought it would come off if i rubbed it hard enough   sarah     we can just be friends  can't we  'cause there's nothing else     i mean  if you're wanting any more     friends is difficult enough   yeah   leanne had a choice though  didn't she   she could've found the idea of you having a fan club funny   flattering  even   no  no way   if i smiled at the old lady in the post office  i had to explain myself   i never understood why leanne was so    insecure   rosie  dad  daddy   she had

read about it in the newspapers   but i can't remember it   and if you know something  and you can't remember it  you can't make sense of it   you can't be sure it's true   they found me  under the

than magnitude  7   on a clear night  our grandparents  might have seen half of them   still looks beautiful to me   no  but you don't understand  it's the light   we're polluting the sky with light   and too much light is like too much information  it gets in the way   guv     lll met by moonlight    hmm   wasted on me  pal   sir     so    come on  lain   you've been waiting a month  a bit longer won't kill you   matt  she was always dreaming up mad revenges  for if she ever caught me with another woman   rusty penknife  no anesthetic   you know   but it was a joke  in a way    well  kind of a     serious sort of joke   like she meant it  but was trying to find ways to say it  that softened it a bit   matt  yeah  'cause she hated being so jealous   but she couldn't help it   she used to check my phone   go through my text messages   matt  let's just wait till tonight's over   that's how she found out about the texts from danielle   stupid little sexy jokes and messages   i didn't
