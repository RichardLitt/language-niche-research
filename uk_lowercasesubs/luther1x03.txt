toys rattle  contains scenes which some viewers may find disturbing   you like that one  don't you    doorbell rings  ms ross  er  kirsten  ross   yes   i'm detective inspector phillip hamilton     my god  is carl all right  baby gurgles  is carl ok   perhaps if i      of course  i'm sorry  please     before i go on  i might ask if there's anyone else at home   anyone who might  um  be able to help   no  no  i'm waiting for    oh  god  is he all right   now that's not what we answer   either he opens the door to find his wife and baby spread all over the carpet     or he comes home to find the baby safely asleep in its cot  but his wife gone   so kirsten     which is it to be   liquid dripping    love is like a sin my love    for the ones that feel it the most    look at her with her eyes like a flame    she will love you like a fly will never love you    again     why all the secrecy   i want your unadulterated impressions   unadulterated by what   rumours  just go in   it's blood   the victim   kirsten ross  thirty two  missing  presumed abducted   she got a young child  leo ross  yeah three months old  is the baby all right   untouched  father comes home  sees all this  imagines the worst   what you think he did this  the father   no  i'm not thinking that    do not fear the abyss  for i am the abyss and thou shalt weep with the fervour and bliss of my love    blimey  satanism   are you superstitious about that sort of thing   not so much  no  not as a rule   but  this is pretty weird   the writing   same hand  same writer  what hand  what writer   ten years ago grace allen was abducted from her home   her baby was asleep upstairs  unhurt  no sign of struggle   her husband comes home  finds his hallway looking like this   same writing  same words   three months later  the investigation received an anonymous tip  some bloke     who claims to be an accomplice of this man     lucien burgess  burgess is a rich kid   but he's born with bad blood   aged 30  he's got his own little black magic cult derived on the writings of aleister crowley   who called himself   the great beast    the blood on the walls  human and fresh   tapped from a living source   human body's got six litres of it   tap a little bit at a time  over a few weeks     you've got a whole body's worth of blood to splash around   but no corpse  and the handwriting   burgess favours the right   whoever wrote on the walls favours the left   they were confident they had their man  but they had nothing on him   so an undercover operation was authorised   it went wrong  while he was supposed to be undercover  ds richard henley attempted to make an arrest   he did this     all but killed him  henley does three and a half years for gbh   burgess gets rich on government compensation   then sells his story to the tabloids which are still published as a 'memoir' which is still a year after  all this  grace allen's body turns up right next to a railway siding   she'd been frozen post mortem   when they found her  she'd been completely exsanguinated   burgess had drained her blood   forensics confirm   the writing on the wall tonight was in grace allen's blood   still fresh  ten years later  that must be enough to pick him up   well  yeah  ordinarily   but the last time the police went after him  we caused a full blown media and political shit storm   kirsten ross is probably still alive out there right now   finding her is our highest priority     but not our sole priority  it's imperative we stay clear of burgess   we don't so much as cast a glance in his direction until we've got something bulletproof   train rumbles  banging and muffled cries  pounding  woman crying  whimpering and pounding  muffled terrified woman's voice  crying and pounding  pounding continues  woman screams  crackling of audio  are you mark north  yeah   hi   oh  my god    what happened   they were waiting for me  who   whoever did this  what do you mean   he sent girls   he sent girls to do it  that man is a genius   he wouldn't  you think   let me have a look   let me have a look   according to the literature  if the left handed man actually existed   he'd be an acolyte  follower  a submissive personality   what  an apostle that betrays his master to the police and then still works with him  ten years later   that doesn't sound right to me   so what  what are we saying then   well  burgess wants fame  doesn't he  he wants infamy   he wants to humiliate the police   we had his handwriting analysed   tried to make him write with his left hand and he couldn't do it   yeah  but it's still not right  though  is it   grace allen's ten year old blood shows up at kirsten ross's house tonight   and the blood on the walls at grace allen's house was human too   the source was never identified  never   maybe they weren't looking in the right place   you know  maybe they were thinking it was as fresh as it looked   so it could have come from another victim  an even earlier victim  yeah  maybe a lot earlier   do me a favour  dig around cold cases  unsolved with similar indications   phone rings  john  dci luther's phone  ds ripley   oh  brilliant yeah  cheers   boss    boss  yeah   i lost you for a minute there   yes  sorry i do that  what  your undercover guy's here   oh  god he looks like shit   dci john luther  richard henley  i really appreciate

i'm returning home  i'm parking  same place  same time as usual   and they walk up the street  but it's the  it's the  stiff arm by the side  you know what is that about  why do they do that    they   who exactly are   they    these  these hoodies  these kids  these girls   girls  girls  and so i'm surrounded   and one of them says   are you mark north    i say   yeah   bang  i'm on the floor having the shit kicked out of me   and then  the same girl  says   john says hello    john says hello  word for word   please   the truth is richard  we're nowhere   all right  we've got socos at the house  bodies on the street   he won't have left you anything   not at all   and the clock is ticking on kirsten ross   i'm not a copper any more  yes  you are   there was a       a lot of sex stuff   did he use blood  in your presence   he said all bodily fluids were powerful   semen  vaginal secretions  blood  menstrual blood was best   i mean what did he do with it   well  all that stuff had to be taken into the body  in various ways   and you had to     i let him do anything he wanted   richard     whatever happened  whatever you  allowed to happen to you   all right  you did something valiant   and every copper in this shop knows that  it didn't help though  did it   how did you end up  beating him   i'd been undercover for 15 months   thought i'd won his trust   this one night  we're at his flat  and he gives me a glass of wine   i drink it     wake up tied to a chair   it turns out  he'd known i was police from day one   he showed me a picture of grace allen  she was alive   and the picture right next to her face  that day's paper   and he said    this is the closest you'll ever come    and he set light to the picture and burnt it right in front of me   then he cut me loose  and that's when you did that   yeah  yeah   that's what i did   pounding  she whimpers  you are radiant   ssh   are you ready   she screams  who's that  in there  oh  that's  er  richard henley   ex copper richard henley   yeah  well what's left of him   who's in there with the duchess   er  oh  that's  mark north   right  hmm   busy night  then   sir   she was naked   and  er   in some kind of box   er  rectangular  not coffin shaped   it was  er  shorter deeper   she was tied at the wrists and ankles with a     it was too dark to see properly   er  her eyes were       er  like a horse's eyes  when it's terrified   how could you erm   how could you read the paper   sorry  you said the box  it was too dark  to see details of the straps   but you read the headline  you could see her eyes  how   there was a light across her face   a reflection of the flash or something  a light   like a crescent of light   it was her eyes that did it   i wanted to kill him   i knew it would cost me  but i didn't care   and to this day   the biggest regret of my life is not killing the     any idea what  it's like to feel like that   yes  i do   i know exactly what that feels like   whimpering and spraying  leave me alone  leave me alone     she screams  three guesses why zoe's gentleman caller was here   to confess he's a dick   he's been assaulted   good  he blames you  oh  come on   you've already come close to one suspension for assaulting him   so i'm pretty much obliged to take this seriously   the man is a fantasist   the marks on his face aren't fantasies   guv  all due respect  kirsten ross is out there alive right now   and you bother me with this   seriously  ok   i'll take my time entering the paperwork   but i will be entering it  first thing tomorrow     unless mark north withdraws his complaint before then   if he does  no one need know this ever happened   thank you   yeah  so go  sod off  speak to him   be nice  beg  if you have to   i ran the blood from the grace allen cold case through every available database   we got a match  precious akingbade was found on the banks of a canal in birmingham   exsanguinated  genitally mutilated   i remember this  this was years ago   yeah  20 years  1990   two different murders  completely different mos   separated by a decade and half a country   you know  burgess must've been      benny  i appreciate you coming in   that's ok  i was just immersed in the world of  er  king crimson and the world of war craft   er  as much as i love you  i can't pretend to know what that is   what i'm trying to say is  do i smell like someone who's been smoking marijuana   a little bit  d'you think anybody's going to notice   see if you can id these girls   quietly as you can   you ok  i will be  once you tell me who they are   give me an hour or two  or three   boss   burgess runs a little occult bookshop  they sell on line   do you think burgess will be at work today   he's got to make it look like a normal day   pay him a little visit   john  you come here today   seriously  mark  mark     oh  dear   look  i had nothing to do with this   look  what you did  john  i understand it   all right  it was subtle  in a brutal way     which kind of sums you up  i suppose  but look at my face   all right  look  if you do this  all right  there's an innocent woman out there that's going to get hurt   it's got nothing to do with this     you  me  all the rest of it   john  you can't keep saying to zoe that you love her and then putting her through this  you have to stop   stop for her  stop for you  stop   listen to me  mark  i'm asking you as nicely as i can   don't do this to me   and what exactly are you saying   if you're going to threaten me   why don't you make a proper job of it  say it out loud  so we all know where we stand   zoe  there are lots of things i wish i had told you   things that i did that i was ashamed of  afraid of   i didn't talk to you   but at least i didn't lie   ok  like i'm not lying now   mark  i didn't do this to you  i really need you to trust me on this   alice  what are you playing at   i thought you wanted zoe back   and you do it by getting me blamed for beating up mark north   getting me fired  i'm in serious trouble  more trouble than you think   you won't lose your job   or your wife  alice  do me a favour   stop interfering   all right  please  no more helping  can you do that   john   yeah    how'd you know that   we do most of our trade on line     or by appointment   so     i'm all yours   what's your pleasure   five hundred quid       for a poem hand illustrated by the yorkshire ripper   seven hundred and fifty quid for a letter from the ripper to a female correspondent  wow   well  that includes a small self portrait  sutcliffe snuggling up to a woman   large breasted  hmm   but you know there's nothing new under the sun   there used to be quite a trade in handkerchiefs dipped in the blood of hanged men   hair clippings  snuff boxes  garters  cravat pins   who would buy them   young women  mostly   wow  young women   even stuff like this   peter kurten     the vampire of dusseldorf   richard trenton chase  the vampire of sacramento  women buy this stuff   it's a kink  a sex thing   many  many women fantasise about being tied up  strangled   raped  eaten   you think so  oh  yeah   the more depraved the killer  the more women fawn on him   it's called hybristophilia   sexual arousal from thoughts of violence   it's his willingness to murder that attracts her   his murder becomes hers   hmm   well  i have a confession  really   yeah   my auto biography  you're a fan  you got me   course you know  if i sign this  its resale value increases hugely  i'll be putting money in your pocket   i know  you're a dealer   collector  and i'm paying   well  it's two hundred and fifty   you serious  oh  yes   i've quite the following   well  you've got yourself a deal   there you go   good catch   there you are   sacrificial lamb  yeah   yeah  well     hissing and whimpering  i learned with terrible horror this morning of the disappearance of kirsten ross   my heart goes out to her and to her family  especially her husband and her little daughter   having already received a visit this morning from a man who i believe  to have been a police officer i've called this press conference in anticipation of my arrest   i want to say publicly   while i'm still able  that i had nothing to do with this crime   nor the crime  nor the crime  against poor grace allen   i pray that  this time  the police service can see past its own prejudice  and its own desire to seek a sacrificial lamb   thank you  mr burgess will now take questions   burgess has taken absolute control of this investigation  we can't go near him   he can't let kirsten ross live now   well  not for too long and he can't afford to   now he knows we're on his back like this   the order was stay away from him   boss  he prepared the whole thing   the abduction  the press conference  everything   so kirsten ross dies a lonely death  while the media ensure we can't go near our only suspect   right  i submitted mark north's statement this morning   oh  god  don't take me off this   not because of him  i can find kirsten  i can find her   i fought your corner and i fought it hard  nobody wants you off this   all right  but    but what   there are caveats   what caveats   mr schenk   martin schenk   complaints   i know this isn't a good day  so all i ask is five minutes   you and i sit down  have a chat  put this silliness to bed   absolutely  it's just that i have an abduction on at the moment  and time's running out for my victim   do you mind if i just brief sergeant ripley about something   absolutely   keep the train moving   that man is about to suspend me   he can't do that  can he   can  has to and will  so we got to work real quick   still nothing solid  no forensics  eyewitnesses  cctv  nothing   so revisit the cold cases  what did burgess leave behind   nothing  the man's a ghost  we know that about him   all we're looking for is where he kept precious and grace  between abduction and dumping the bodies  hmmm   precious akingbade lived and died in birmingham   i can't see anything that links burgess to the midlands   no  forget the distance between them   what do the dumpsites have in common   precious akingbade was dumped by the side of a canal   yeah and grace allen was dumped here  easy access to the road way   but less than a hundred metres from a waterway   henley said there was a crescent of light  across the grace allen picture   bright enough to read the headlines  a reflection  a flash   so that's what he said it looked like  what if it wasn't that   what if it was daylight coming in  through a round window   he's got a boat   i've got to get out of here  cover me   i was waiting for dci luther   erm  last time i saw him  sir  he was headed that way  which way   that way  er   absolutely  yeah   so what do you want   i need you to help me catch someone   i was under the impression you wanted me to stop helping   don't push it   how do i know you're not playing a double game   one stone  multiple birds   trying to make me speak carelessly in order to entrap me   that would be illegal  plus i really need to catch this man   more than you want to catch me   at the moment  yeah   i'm running out of time   because if i thought you were about to lose interest in me       i'd be inconsolable   i just need a way in   to know what it's like to be him   to not feel anything   i feel things   not mercy  not sentiment   i can't empathise for this man's state of being  any more than you can   because  disregarding a single  alleged act   carried out for different alleged reasons   he and i might just as well be from different species   see  i disagree   murder's murder  but it isn't  is it  not even to you   this man burgess   he's just a naughty child showing off   you already know his flaw    his compulsion to dominate  to be in control   and you already know  how to exploit that   how  oh  come on   change the state of play   yeah  well  i tried that with you       and it failed   only just   panicked  frantic breathing   phone rings ripley     erm  will do   ok  yeah  right away   erm  dci luther's waiting for me outside   i am very much obliged to you  detective sergeant ripley   no problem  sir   go on   so i went through every record of stolen boats from 1988 to 1991  and   first  there's way many  turns out boats get stolen a lot   so i'm thinking  he needs a vessel that can navigate canals in birmingham  that cuts the list   all these were reported stolen in '89   just before the last recession  so lots of bogus insurance claims  six stolen boats  six owners   i cross referenced the names against burgess's known history   what d'you find  louis gallant  claimed for a stolen narrowboat  the julia  in july 1989   suspected fraudulent claim  never proven   connection to burgess  friends at cambridge   they were arrested together  on a charge of possession with intent to supply crack cocaine   that's a pretty big charge for two middle class white boys in '89   burgess takes the rap  does a bit of time  gallant walks   so he was in debt to burgess  all we got to do is     already done it  gallant is a family man with a serious job   credit crunched  and mortgaged up the wazoo   i got everything for a promise not to drag him through court   so he sold the boat to burgess  no he gave it to him   even helped forge a new registration number   easily done  apparently   burgess renames the boat the isis   i've got a copy of the agreement to berth  housing boat certificate   british waterways certificate  council tax  insurance   boat safety certificate  they show he's moored at st katharine's dock   now the bad news   all these documents are in the name of this guy  brian summers   oh  bollocks   so what are you saying  burgess used a proxy to get the licenses   a friend  out of work actor  junkie  con artist from prison  who knows   i tell you what  if we want to search this boat   we have to make it part of the investigation   the only way to do that is to prove that brian summers didn't exist   we could spend weeks of due diligence  just chasing our tails around   insufficient evidence  search warrant denied   we go upstairs with that   they'll say   go away  you haven't done enough  do your homework    kirsten ross dies  burgess dumps the body and walks  again   all right  so what do we do  forget the rule book   change the state of play   all right   kirsten   kirsten ross  if you can hear me   i'm john luther  a police officer   we're here to get you back to your family   oi   don't   don't what   just don't   what are you saying   we weren't here   that isn't what we said   we said if she was here  we'd call it in   claim exigent circumstances   if she was alive   she's not alive is she   boss  this is a crime scene   a murder scene   you don't walk away  pretend you never saw it   do you want to take down the man who did this  more than anything   all right  well then trust me   ok  there'll be nothing we can use  no forensics  nothing   and he'll wriggle out of this  again   you're a police officer  this is a murdered woman   her family are waiting  going out of their minds  and you want to lock her back up and walk away   this is about the law  not retribution   i'm not asking for your approval  son   just your silence   i won't volunteer any information   but i won't lie for you  either   what you're doing is wrong   yeah  i know  why do it then   cos it's right   ian  i need you   clears throat  detective sergeant ripley   how nice to see you   no  no  no broken bones   yeah  we think it was the husband   he's got some issues he needs to work through   i'll call you back  you off   just for a bit  i've got to  was it me  did i do something   no  i'm sorry  i'm sorry   it's just  er  it's john  he makes me so angry i don't know what to do   look i've got to get out  just walk it off or something   door slams  he's coming your way   all right  got it   i wonder  does john luther discuss his private life with you   no  not his wife   her lover  no   you are aware of his history of instability   i'm aware of it  yes  although i'm not sure of its relevance   well  it may be relevant if it ever gives you pause  to question his decision   erm  my dad taught me to question all judgments  sir   i do apologise   let me rephrase  for clarity   how do you judge the quality  of john luther's current operational decisions   yeah   well  it could be said that the merit of any operational decision  can only be judged on its outcome   as long as that decision was taken within the boundaries of the law   it could be said  yes   but are you saying it   i'm just saying  it could be said   do you know where luther is  right this minute   i do not  sir   guv   ah  you've found him  yes  sir   aah  detective chief inspector luther   you pass like night  from land to land   i do  i really do   there's a coffee shop not far away  shall we   yeah  let's   mobile vibrates  who's this   so how's it going  lucien   i'm sorry  who exactly is this   listen  they've planted evidence  at the crime scene   they tried to frame me once before   they couldn't do it then and they won't be able to do it now   all right  well  i'll be off then   wait  look  i can make this go away   'two hundred thousand  in cash  i know you've got it '  i can't get hold of that  not in time  not in cash   well  you see  i think you can   'my mate  the big one who smacked you '  he's waiting on warrants as we speak   'the crime scene is clear of surveillance until then '  that gives me a window of less than an hour to make this work for you   'now if you don't want to pay for it  that's your call '  i'll give you 125  cash   that'll have to do  where will we meet   'finsbury park station '  platform 2  north bound  half an hour   door opens and closes  john luther didn't do that to you  i'm afraid   i did   why   why  i couldn't help myself   i don't believe that   see  i don't think you  of all people   ever do anything unless you decide to do it   no  it's true  i'm a bit like that   a bit random  slightly kooky   kooky   absolutely   ok  mark  i did this because i don't like you   and because i wanted to toy with john   it's a bit like  pulling legs off flies   why are you here  now   because i'm sorry   no you're not  no  no i'm not   i was just trying to empathise   i'm here because  this has gone just far enough  and what i need you to do now is pick up that phone  and withdraw the complaint   and if i refuse   what if somebody actually stood up to you and refused   well  then  i'd have to leave   and then one night   i'd have to come back   i'm not building a legal case against you  john   this is about moral codes   and my standard of proof  is much lower than yours   and if you breach that code in any way   then we let you go   quietly and without fuss   and you'd recommend that  would you  oh  it's not what i want   my recommendation will be that you are suspended   immediately and indefinitely   and meanwhile   kirsten ross  hmmm   many fine officers are working on the case   for what it's worth  i  erm     wouldn't want it to end like this for you   but there's no place in the service for dirty coppers   no matter how well intentioned   mobile rings  schenk   when   all right  yes  i will   mark north put in a call  to detective chief superintendent teller   apparently  mr north no longer seems to believe  that the street robbers knew his name   or yours  indeed   witness memory   funny old thing   he's withdrawn the allegation   so  er  well  what now   you return to your case   without prejudice   i didn't want to come for you  john   but they sent me to do a job   and if they send for me again  i will come again   and i will take you down  even if it means that i won't be able  to look myself in the eye afterwards   well  i know that feeling   i've got you   i have got you now   ok  that's enough of that   lucien burgess   don't think i can watch any more   did you seriously think that you could entrap me   not really  no   no that blood there was from a nice piece of steak  sirloin   i was going to have for my tea tonight  in celebration of meeting you here   at the crime scene   you came of your own free will   you brought luminol   to look for blood traces   hmmm   that's not enough   oh  i think that it is   do you  yes   well  dci luther   first you  erm     you assault me   you publicly assault me   why can't you show me some respect    then a police officer phones me   he tells me you've been trying to frame me   he tells me where the crime scene is   is that your defence   because that call  that was my mate   we set you up  lucien  you've been outplayed   i look forward to seeing you prove any of that   oh  luther   shall we   turn around   good day's work   goodish  anyway  this is her   alice morgan meeting up with the wee girl  who beat up your wife's boyfriend   don't know whether she's giving her money  drugs  either way  you've got her   cheers  you take care  now   beware of geeks bearing gifts   justin   look    i said nothing   and i won't say anything   but you can't go on like this   you just can't   hmmm  what's this   blackmail now   no   this thing  this weird thing between us  it has to end   why   it's not right  alice   it started off because i was scared of you and i thought   if i could be your friend  i could control you   and i can't control you   i'm still scared of you   well  i'm scared of you  too   you want to send me to prison   what you did to mark nearly cost me   i wouldn't have let it   i know  i know you really think that   and i think  in your own way  your intentions were good   but hurting mark doesn't bring zoe back to me   that's not how people work  that's not how they think   i'll see you soon   zoe  are you all      what are you doing here   saying sorry  sorry for what   for not believing you   what they said you did it's    it's not in your nature   i should've known that of all the people in the world     i should've known   and i should have said
