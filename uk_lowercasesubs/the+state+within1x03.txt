it s been confirmed  it was a bomb   the date for your execution is set for the 16th  you are now in phase two of deathwatch     it s not over for luke    no  i m going to speak to the pardons board   god damn it  i kept that man in power   he s not the same kiss ass he was seven years ago  lynne   you re letting usman dick you around  gordon   who would you rather see as president of tyrgyztan  eshan or usman     is there no other way    it s a go   their flight plan says they were en route to tyrgyztan   they had 10 cylinders of epichlorohydrin   i ll be in the office in 20 minutes     it s the principal ingredient of nerve gas    god    we need positive confirmation from the russian aviation authority  that the final destination of that plane was karaz  tyrgyztan   if i could have the names and passport details of the arrested subjects with british nationality   i ll see what i can tell them this end   the authorities are stressing that this is not a terrorist incident   charles macintyre  you have some of my men in custody   a farce  one dimensional story   fbi agents injured in a customs raid that went wrong   it won t stay small for long  not with brits shooting at the fbi   what have we got   the fbi just confirmed the arrested men were working for cmc secure operations     who s employing cmc    centas industries   a tyrgyztan registered company set up in 2002 to handle development contracts   why would they want 10 cylinders of chlorine gas   don t know yet  but usman s brother s on the board   what s that bastard macintyre got us mixed up in now     special agent blake    colonel macintyre     we have a very bad situation here    indeed you do   i ve got flight manifests for the transport plane and its cargo to karaz  tyrgyztan   firearms licences for my employees   contracts to provide security for centas industries in the bukek district   and an export licence for 200 litres of epichlorohydrin for use in water treatment   your actions last night  special agent blake  severely endangered the lives of my men  while they were going about their legitimate business   your employees resisted arrest and engaged in gunfire with my agents   two of them were seriously injured   you should think yourself lucky more people weren t killed   didn t you do your homework  highly toxic chemicals were involved   armed forces  unknown to my men  ambushed them at night     naturally  they defended themselves    appropriate warnings were given   that s not their recollection of events   look     i have a dead colleague with a widow and two children  what the hell were you doing     i was acting on information received    received from whom   i m not at liberty to disclose that   my lawyer s going be lodging an official complaint regarding the fbi s handling of this situation   and if you want to hang on to your job  i suggest you release my men   thanks for your cooperation  mr macintyre   now that i have all this paperwork to get through  i ll be holding your colleagues  until i m satisfied we ve investigated every scrap of evidence thoroughly   i ll call you right back   when i was a special envoy to tyrgyztan   i was given a tour of a chemical factory financed by the uk government   centas doesn t need to import epichlorohydrin  tyrgyztan can produce it by the tanker   so why have it flown in   maybe tyrgyztan wasn t the real destination   that s a possibility  maybe it was   if you re planning to gas your own people   you wouldn t want the chemical to be traceable to a factory down the road  would you   it s a theory     what happened    you tell me   the fbi said they were acting on intelligence  so someone talked   are you accusing my lads   listen  if that plane had gone up  it would have lit the sky from here to baltimore   well  we have a leak  was it sinclair   you re head of defense intelligence  for christ s sake  ask the fbi   they might want to know why i m interested     well  maybe you got careless    right  i sent a memo     do we abort    do you honestly believe we d be allowed to jump   this juggernaut is not stopping   all right  if there was any real knowledge out there  we d already be headed for death row     i ll make sure sinclair s contained    good   we stay the course  this could play to our advantage   yeah   pm s office has confirmed he ll be attending the memorial service next month   we re waiting to hear which royal the palace are fielding   phil     eshan borisvitch is prepared to hold talks with the us administration     i wasn t aware they were putting out feelers    they re not  he is   apparently i m the only person he ll come out of hiding for   don t be flattered  it s a poisoned chalice     macintyre    colonel  we need to meet   ma am  i brought these for thomas   thank you   i had to send my own son to war  christopher   sometimes our duty requires us to make terrible sacrifices   i do not shrink from that  nor should you   amen   how soon before the media learn those chemicals were heading for tyrgyztan    make it sooner rather than later   what have you got that connects this to usman   centas  the company that hired them  his brother s listed as one of the directors   we ve had reports he s cracking down on islamic militants after the plane bombing   come on  carl  if he was gonna do that  he d send his own army in in the current climate   this is a covert operation   night time flight  heavily armed mercenaries   that would enough to make enough nerve gas to kill how many  an entire town     it would do    what are you saying   when you were standing in the first democratic elections  there was an accident in a meeting hall     gas leak  53 people died    it was carbon monoxide   i was supervising the election  so i had sight of the initial pathology report   it mentioned blistering on the skin of the victims   when the official report was published  all mention of blistering had been removed   the man s gassed people before  carl  are we just going to stand by   i mean  surely there comes a point at which it s impolitic for us to be in business with usman   which leaves who     eshan borisvitch is in hiding    what if i can get him to washington     secret talks  toe in the water  that s all    is this coming from downing street   as far as tyrgyztan is concerned  my government wants whatever the us administration wants   the president won t consider it without warner s say so     if i wanted to get her in dialogue with borisvitch    it d be tough   so you guys must really be pissed  huh     about what    i hear the cmc contract s legitimate   someone must have fed the fbi false information   not my department  mate  talk to trade   wait a minute  you re telling me british mercenaries  heavily armed   and you didn t know anything about it   must have had my eye off the ball  sorry     you get my marmalade    what   orange  thick cut   stop being coy  ask me if i ve been to london   have you been to london     yeah    look who s being coy  for christ s sakes   let   don t get moody with me  sweetheart   let s play   i m sick of tidying up after you  colonel  what other embarrassments can i expect   it s out of office hours  so unless you ve got something to offer me   i ve got better places to be   we re in the market for trigger switches   we ll pay above list price   you re out of your depth  brocklehurst   isn t there someone back home warming your bed   please   it s gary  gary pritchard on the telly     who    a friend of luke s   they were in the paras together     which channel

gary   well done  luke  you saved the life of a psychotic cop shooter   they have been charged with resisting arrest  no other charges have been laid at this time   but i can tell you they will be held for further questioning   there are still many unanswered questions  how did the fbi intercept     don t worry  you ll never get to wear it       and most importantly  what were these mercenaries intending to do  with the key ingredient to the making of nerve gas     yeah    azzam sinclair   put him through  hi  azzam  it s mark   is my dad with you   no  why  where are you   he said he was

nasreen tells me you have something i should hear   yeah  hi  i m the human rights liaison in the luke gardner case   the men arrested in the customs bust  the brit mercenaries   well  i don t know if it s of any use but luke s mother recognised one of them     what name    gary pritchard     how reliable is mrs gardner    why   traumatic times  bad optician   she doesn t wear glasses and she isn t gaga   and she has a photograph  why  what are you saying   that the name gary pritchard isn t on the list of arrested men   no  no  it isn t  how come she knows him   well  he and luke served together in the falklands   luke won his military medal saving pritchard   was anyone else with you when mrs gardner recognised pritchard   matthew weiss  washington press   thank you for bringing this to my attention  jane   and if you find out anything else  anything at all  just let me know   sure  of course   secretary warner  secretary warner   how does this government justify its continued support of president usman   tyrgyztan has been a loyal and steadfast supporter of this country in the war on terror   madam secretary  are you concerned  that the chemical recovered is used in the manufacture of nerve gas   as far as i understand it  epichlorohydrin could be used for many applications     that s it    madam secretary     one more question  please  madam secretary     where s azzam    he s waiting in the car   i need to know what happened last night will never happen again   no more drink   you have my word  on saida s grave   i screwed up  i love azzam  i wouldn t do anything     there s nothing you can say to me that i haven t already said to myself   so just bring me my son   how soon can you get eshan into the country     what    how soon   you to act as broker   who s he seeing at the administration   okay  does london know you re talking to me   tell eshan he ll be my guest at the residence  we ll arrange a diplomatic visa and security   i ll send azzam up     sir mark  nicholas    madam secretary     please    thank you for seeing us   there have been some disturbing indications  that the situation in tyrgyztan is not as viable as our governments may wish   this may well be the time for us to consider alternative strategies for the region   especially if they contribute to our stated aim of promoting global democracy   nice speech  so what s the proposal   i m in a position to facilitate face to face talks with eshan borisvitch   we have us personnel  military bases  american investments to protect   if usman were to suspect that i was in dialogue with the guy at the top of his hit list   all of the above would be in grave jeopardy   forgive me  madam secretary  i would suggest that all of the above may be in jeopardy  if you don t talk to eshan borisvitch   a chinese trade delegation in karaz this morning   where s the pm on this   any dialogue with borisvitch is to be exploratory  held in camera   plausible deniability on both sides   brokered by me     make the arrangements    thank you   i ll have my assistant ring sally   a man deceives me once  shame on him  deceives me twice  shame on me   thank you  mark     that was easy    yes  wasn t it   what leverage do we have with the governor of florida   the kerbside at tampa international airport is for loading and unloading only   violators will be ticketed and towed   karpinski   it s not for me to opinionate on the legal rights and wrongs of this case   in the 21 years i ve worked here  i ve never asked for a man s life before   i guess what you want to know from me is  if you let luke gardner back into the worid   will folk be able to sleep safely at night   i have two daughters  shalette just turned 17  angeline  she s going on 11   i love them the most in this worid   but if luke gardner called   said he had no where to stay  i d say    come over      that s about it  i guess   all i can do now is pray for a rightful decisi n   if luke gardner dies   i don t believe it s god s will   thank you  vernon  for your testimony     we ll take serious note    thank you   all of us are aware of the witness statements  that were never submitted at luke gardner s original trial   the violation of his right to effective counsel under the sixth amendment  that have brought us to this room   if there is a reasonable doubt   even the smallest doubt in your minds  that luke gardner is guilty of the crimes for which he s been convicted   then you have the opportunity to reverse a travesty of justice and free a man  who does not deserve to die   they re deliberating     how did it go    well  i think   warden salke   hold on a moment   yeah   persuaded  possibly  i d say we could be looking at clemency   i want you to know  warden  that you have my full support  as ever     always appreciated  governor    i understand  it s hard   it s hard to do the right thing  to send a man to his death   but it s not as if luke gardner hasn t had his chance in the highest court in the land   we have two families who lost their daughters tragically  and a violent junkie   now  i know he says he s repentant  but then  they all are   are you sure  i mean  you know  is this really what we want   any god fearing citizen knows that gardner sealed his fate the day he killed those two giris   now  what happens next  that s between him and his maker   i know that you can help the board understand that  jerry   i d better go   nice talking to you   after thorough examination  of all the facts surrounding the case of prisoner luke gardner   the pardons and parole board of stark prison have found  against gardner s plea for clemency   i should have never used the travesty of justice line   jumped up blowhard lecturing them on justice     how was the vote split    it was unanimous     that doesn t make any sense    i know   luke s lawyer wants to appeal on the grounds that lethal injection is a cruel and unusual punishment   luke s refusing  he sees it as admissi n of guilt  it s not over  i ll fight it to the last second   what about the governor  he has the power to stay executions for 60 days     karpinski    governor karpinski   he won t return my calls   he s in tampa now  flying back to tallahassee late tomorrow   i ve got 36 hours before an innocent man dies   can you try and find out what his itinerary is   he s at a church dedication at 10 00   followed by a formal lunch with the mayor at the peninsula     what have i got on tomorrow that s important    service for the victims  families  st john s church   tell phil he s standing in for me   yeah  sally will call you and tell you what flight i m on   great  thanks   okay  bye     i m going to need a file on florida executions    right   it wasn t your fault     i never said      yes  you did     can i get another one of these  please    yeah  sure   i had a gut feeling  not pure science  i admit  but     i thought we had the pardons board     i could have      thanks   yeah  no problem   the man we know as gary pritchard  the fbi arrested him under the name david ewan tegner   luke and pritchard leave the paras at exactly the same time   and they completely disappear off the radar  no work permits  no visa applications  zilch   except the bar fight in bangkok   guess what  luke isn t the only one that s arrested  so is pritchard   now  here s my theory   luke and pritchard both work for cmc and were in bangkok for a little r and r   for the record  i want you to know this  i am not intimidated by intelligent women   okay  so behind their corporate face  cmc is into some nasty shit   we re talking coup attempts  civil wars   wherever there s money to be made out of chaos  they re there   okay  here s the thing  seven years ago  before luke emerges in florida   cmc was working for president usman of tyrgyztan   oh  my god   i couldn t even spell tyrgyztan until a couple of days ago   so  here s what we got   we got a plane blown up by a bomber with connections to tyrgyztan militants   the fbi busts two military transporters loaded with dangerous chemicals to tyrgyztan   ferried by mercenaries connected to the cmc     including gary pritchard    so tyrgyztan     usman  cmc  pritchard  luke   now  stick with me here  despite all expectations and your gut feeling  the pardons board reject gardner s plea for clemency     whoa  where are you going with this    i don t know   my gut feeling  coincidences make me twitchy     i ll talk to luke tomorrow    you were made for me  you know that   eshan  tell me where eshan is   tell me where eshan borisvitch is   tell me where he is   eshan borisvitch   eshan borisvitch arrives in washington the day after tomorrow  for talks with embassy administration   did whitehall approve that or did you just cook it up with downing street   the foreign secretary and i discussed it this afternoon   you didn t think to  um  consult me   the talks are highly confidential   no media  no paperwork  no official acknowledgement of eshan s presence   gordon adair s offered to fly him in on his private jet   borisvitch is staying where  at the residence  as my guest   you live in a goldfish bowl  you expect to keep that secret   yes  i do  his visit is strictly need to know   you couldn t resist  could you   if usman finds out  then what  uk us trade agreements torn up   another crackdown on the tyrgyztani people   he was probably about to gas a large number of them  phil   how long are we meant to plead ignorance   there hasn t been an election since  98  how prepared is that country for democracy   do we actually know  what about borisvitch  if usman learns he s here     eshan knows the risks   look  these are difficult choices   badly judged  i ll thought out   i ll make sure whitehall is fully aware of your concerns   of course  if you pull it off  you get all the glory   but if it goes tits up  it s not just your career on the shit heap   you saved this man s life   gary pritchard  when you were in the paras  gary in south africa   david tegner when he s on duty for cmc  how many passports have you got   the bad dreams  luke  the missing years  travelling   what are you hiding   tyrgyztan  cmc   what s going on   is there someone else who needs this execution to take place   i don t want to watch you die  luke     you are a sweet girl    no  i m not     it s a compliment    not where i come from   but thanks     you should go    no   i don t want to say goodbye   i m going to be okay     will you look after my mum    yes   you made the last few days a lot of fun  now piss off  all right   i want to make a call  vernon     i have a mr luke gardner for you  sir    put him through     macintyre    luke   i m so sorry things haven t worked out   you get me out of here  you fucker   this isn t sierra leone  luke  i can t just ram the gates and send the boys in   hey  i haven t forgotten bukek   if i die tonight  you are screwed   you hear   macintyre  macintyre   hey  you fucker  fucker  you fucker  you fucker     fucker     have you told anyone else    i was going to tell the ambassador     no  i wouldn t do that    if it could help luke     you d be making accusations about a conspiracy to kill luke gardner without any evidence   yes  yes  of course  you re right   so let mark handle it his way  meanwhile  i ll do some digging   no more discussions with journos or luke s mum   let s keep this between us until we have some hard facts     anything else about luke s past      bring it to you  sure   i ve got to go     sir mark    jane  hi     have you met sally  my private secretary    hi   we d better hurry if we re going to catch karpinski   governor karpinski  mark brydon   ambassador  i warned your office on the phone   i have no intention of granting a stay of execution   i have a letter here from my prime minister   i trust the judgement of the pardons board  sir mark     i m sorry if you ve wasted your time    governor  can i just float something by you   i ve been investigating the cases of execution in florida under your governorship     eight    right   and none of them have the reasonable doubt that luke gardner s case does   i appreciate  truly  that it s hard to accept these rulings  but i can assure you  the men and women who made this decisi n did not treat it lightly   you know  it becomes barbaric to prolong these things   as i understand it  the supreme court had to reject his plea on a constitutional technicality   but everyone involved was confident the pardons board would free him   you re saying someone got to the board  to warden salke   i m saying that if they have  if it ever came to light  governor   the buck stops with you   i know jerry salke personally  he is an honourable man   this is out of my hands  i can t help you   i went to him with concerns about the pardons board   i ve come away with a much bigger question  is it possible karpinski wants gardner dead   is he being leant on     i ll get onto it    strictly between you and me  nicholas   of course     hey    hiya   well   if there is a link between karpinski and gardner  i can t find it   what about a connection with the victims  families   i checked  nothing   mrs gardner  if you would like to have a seat over here   ambassador  it s an honour to have you with us   warden salke   thank you very much   i didn t kill those giris  vernon   it s     it s just that other ghosts are catching up  you know   this is who you are   okay  okay   oh  no   oh  no   sir mark  sir mark  i m matthew weiss  i m with the washington press   not now   i d really appreciate it if you could spare some time     not now   sam s going to take jackie back to the motel  do you want to go to the airport now     yes  thanks    okay     excuse me  sir  can i have a word    yes  of course     i ll see you outside    yeah   how are you   this is from luke   thanks   i d better go  i m    i ll talk to you soon     macintyre    it s done   thanks   richard lawson   it s pretty hard to recognise him  what with his jaw blown off   a colleague of yours  i believe   in what way is this relevant to the charges against my client   they were at a training camp together in keyser   i can understand that men die accidentally in training  right   occupational hazard  i imagine   but stripping the body and removing the bullet  shooting his face off   dumping richard 50 miles away     is there any evidence linking my client to this man s death   if this operation in tyrgyztan s legitimate  why go to all that trouble to cover up his death   david   you an ex marine like richard   no one in the british army called david ewan tegner   i mean  is this even real   because entering the country illegally is a very serious offence   my client s papers are totally valid   well  you must be employee of the month  mr tegner   because cmc just paid your  200 000 bail   no leaving town  you report here every morning  your passport stays with me   if it had been up to me  i d have buried him  right where he dropped     go on    i ve tied up the loose ends   you ve got nothing to worry about at my end   good   hello  mark   jesus  christopher   you think you ve got all the bases covered and there s an incendiary device like this out there   my message to president usman  stand down   this cannot leak   the entire credibility of western government is at stake   they expect your resignation
