abfe   abfe  erm  scrounger squad      snooper squad    the one with the spending implications   the prime minister's view  is ''fuck the spending implications  i like it ''    good    so this is us  we're on the map   it's a chance for me  glenn  to get on richard  judy and plant that flag  right on their fucking sofa   so the prime minister's authorised you to announce it  has he   that's very much what he signalled  very clearly   he said he's right behind us on this and it's very much what we should be doing   this is great  so we can do it this afternoon at the school     we can clear the press conference      excuse me    we'll double bubble it  leak it to the standard for the early editions  and trail it on the world at one  yes   we need someone at the standard we can give this to   what about angela heaney  she's at the standard now  isn't she  olly   erm   yes  she is   do you not think that maybe she's a bit junior  i think   bit too much like your ex who broke your heart and dumped you with a text message   it was a fucking email  not a text message   we give it to her  she'll write what we want     she's easy    she is easy   i can see that you've all got big  stiffhard ons for this        sorry    i'm not saying that's not nice     but       terri     there is no way we're gonna clear it by this afternoon      why not    so cool it  and i'll ring paul at the treasury      no  no  no    no calls to the treasury   ifyou call the treasury  to get near the announcement  he's going to have to dress up as catering with a big tray ofdrinks and a pot ofsliced lemons   i'm not doing that     i'm just going by procedure     terri   i love doing things the right way  that ethical stuff  i love it  we all do   but it's difficult when you're the first to put your gun down  because people jump on your head as ifit's a ripe watermelon  we don't want that   the prime minister said he wants to do it  he's above the treasury in the hierarchy     i can write it down on a chart     whatever      thank you    i'll get to it  minister   you're just doing your job    not very well   will you get angela on the phone for olly     you can deal with this olly  yes

exactly the kind ofthing we should be doing ''  what did he actually say   he said  ''this is exactly the sort ofthing we should be doing ''  should be doing  should does not mean yes   now  there's

that   no  erm  this isn't a   change in policy in any   in any respect     no    what's going on  olly    bec    no  well  the truth is that i       acted beyond my brief    what are you talking about    i dunno  i just kind of   wanted to play the big man in front ofyou     you just made something up    no   listen  angela  i am really so sorry   ifit's any help  the line that we're giving to everybody else  is that there's a disgruntled civil servant     they leaked the story    have you got a name    do i have a name for the disgruntled civil servant        derek  derek   terri  terri

do today is be stuck in a fucking lay by by a wacky warehouse   begging my ex girlfriend   all right  so     what the hell am i going to say  is the reason for me summoning  all the nation's major news organisations to a school in wiltshire    you want something sexy  eye catching  and that is free and universally popular  and instantly applicable  no one could possibly object to it     yes    well  you should have said before  glenn   because i've got a file about that fucking thick ofthat back in the office     those policies are ten a penny    olly     our entire manifesto is made up of      it doesn't help when you get cynical   think ofthis as an opportunity   i can't just come up with das kapital in a cab  glenn     olly    here  shave      what we need is something that the public want  that's incredibly popular and is free     return ofcapital punishment      that's a joke  right  you are joking  yes  obviously   come on  olly  come up with something    national spare room database   what about zoos   my kids went to a zoo the other day and they said it was fucking disgusting   you know  the state ofit   that's shit  isn't it   no   but there is an idea there  because in the middle ofthe city you've got wild animals   pet asbos  remember that  asbos for pets   that sounds potentially ludicrous  but then pet passports  that was a goer    what ifeverybody had to carry a plastic bag by law   you know identification cards are coming in     you've fucking cracked  are you mad   what ifthe announcement is    there's no big announcement      for goodness      no  wait   we say the department ofsocial affairs has been doing amazing work   bread and butter work  belt and braces work   the kind ofwork you aren't interested in cos it's not shiny  shiny  media friendly     you sickos are so obsessed with the media      sickos     that every time we try and   just carry on with our day  you don't show up  so we have to call a big thing like this     on target  under budget      coalface politics     yes  i like that    not wasting resources     good  let's do that    let's go for that   we trick them  tinselly thing and they come along and we say     ''ah  that's what we've been doing  we've been doing our fucking jobs ''  they never print that stuff  do they   you've come two hours out oflondon to cover this     you mugs  you mugs   but you've got a bigger story here than you have chasing tinsel   which is you live in a country which is properly    not many countries can say that   and we've probably got ten million we can throw at it   that's good  because it sounds like a lot  doesn't it   i've got a thing here that says springy concrete  i think that's about the playground       springy concrete     good afternoon       should i say  ''hello  boys and girls''    yes  very nice   like a fucking panto dame   he's gonna look ridiculous on the six o'clock news saying  ''hello  boys and girls ''    he's talking to the audience in front ofhim    real money for real families     real families or people     families      people  real people    you see  don't    families   families sounds exclusive  it sounds back to basics  john

pulled it round  mate   i took the flak  you supplied the flak jacket   yeah  and the bullets bounced off     this is what it's all about  glenn    yeah   all those years at the coalface  hanging in there  taking all the shit  all the bullshit   when you are senior cabinet minister  then we'll show them   yeah  and snooper force  bollocks  we'll get rid ofthat   for fuck's sake  yeah  fiddling while rome burns   fucking right  we'll kick some arse   we'll kick some butt  kick some butt   that's what we're in it for  mate  tell them all the shit that we do   it's a means to an end  mate   fuck me  malcolm  how do you do that   can i have a word with you    i'm hacked off  mate   but w w we killed it  it it's killed   yeah  but once you start the fire     and we didn't start the fire   it was always burning since the world's been turning  et cetera  et cetera   malcolm  you're not making any sense   prime minister  obviously  he's on the plane in stockholm  and somebody hits him with the world at one   he thinks it's the treasury trying to stiffhim one  so he  er     he stuck with the story     he liked it    yeah  he's backing the snooper force   oh  right   you    we shouldn't really then have     i mean  you shouldn't really have told us to  er     should you    don't should me  hugh   cos i'll should you right back  right through that window   none ofthis should be happening  should it  should it  should it   is that should in the   sense ofyes  or      it's should in the sense of you should do as you're fucking told   yep  what  erm     what are we gonna do now   you're gonna completely reverse your position   look  no  hang on a second   hang    malcolm  it's not actually that  erm       that's gonna be quite hard  really    yes  well   the announcement that you didn't make today  you did   no  no  i didn't  and there were television cameras there while i was not doing it   fuck them   i'm not quite sure how    what level ofreality i'm supposed to be operating on   look  this is what they run with   i tell them that you said it  they believe that you said it   they don't really believe you said it     they know you never said it    right   but it's in their interests to say you said it  because ifthey don't  they're not gonna get what you say tomorrow or the next day  when i decide to tell them what it is you're saying   yeah  i i am following this  i just     i had a friend who used to indulge in extramarital affairs  ok   he would go offand have some dalliance  and every monday he'd come back and he'd meet his wife   and he told me that all he did was inside his head turn a little switch     the affair never happened  ok    right   there's not a    what is the problem with this   the problem with it    first ofall  i didn't get much dalliance   get it into your head  rewind today in your head   ok  stop explaining it to me   i have to fucking explain it to you  man  you haven't been here long enough    i don't think he'd be really up for that     tucker's in the building       when did he come in   where are all the people  where are my people   they've gone home  secretary ofstate  it's 5 40   ok  well  erm   listen   the situation is  erm  it's pretty terrible  but things have changed  ok   the line is now  i did announce the snooper force this afternoon at the school   ok  that's what happened  all right   so now you have to tell the media  in case they   missed it   ok  great      what we've got to      i said this was gonna happen     it's happened  it's nobody's fault    i said it  glenn  i       what we have to do      excuse me  it's not my fault  it's yours     i didn't say that      you said it was nobody's fault    but it's your fault and your fault    it's not my fault     ifyou walk away from this i'll pin it on you       everything ok      you cunt   we're fucked   great    this is the real world  terri   we are fucked     how's it going    good   i think they might need a little bit ofcoordination        has anyone spoken to nicky campbell   i've got one missed call here   nicky campbell   it's become so complicated and it's actually terrifically simple   there was always gonna be a snooper force policy  definitely   it's too good to have been invented by a disgruntled civil servant   i'm really glad you came in  angela     well  i could lose my job  olly    yeah     i went all hot and heavy to the news desk with three directly contradictory stories in one day     i know    they gave me flip flops   you know  someone actually went out and bought flip flops to give me   yeah   you've gotta give them credit for that  that is quite funny   yeah  and they pasted onto them     a fucking porn picture ofa girl sucking a big cock  and they wrote ''angela heaney swallows anything''   that is less funny  obviously that's quite offensive   can you give me one good reason why i shouldn't do a big story    on the  you know  the day ofspin    what sort ofstory   inside story ofa government department out ofcontrol  with diagrams and a flow chart with your face and name on it  and glenn's and hugh's and big arrows showing who spoke to who  and how you all fucked it up   i think i could write that one up myself  i think i could do the punctuation on that one     ok  i was patronis      hey  hi  angela   i like the hair  nice little corkscrews  how's it going   yeah  er  fine   we were just  er  talking about why angela shouldn't do a big     story on the big insidery piece  kind ofday ofspin sort ofspread in the       paper    i don't know   maybe you should  good idea   oh  wait a minute  wait a minute   i know why she shouldn't  because ifshe did that  she'd be dead to me  to this department  to the government   and she'd never get another story  or a fucking whiffofa story   so long as she kept her sorry hack bitch face lingering around westminster  because i would call every editor i know  which  obviously  that's all ofthem   and tell them to gouge her name out oftheir address books  so she'd never even get a job on hospital radio  where the sad sack belongs   that's what i'd tell her     but maybe you should do it  see you later    yeah   he   he's actually     he can be really nice   it's been a very long day   i didn't say we weren't doing it  which is as good as saying we were     thanks  bye bye    the world tonight   hello  hugh abbot here   yes  no  always a pleasure to speak to the world tonight   go live on air now   yes  ofcourse  i'd be delighted to   robin  my pleasure  nice to be with you   yes  before i answer that  may i just say how delighted i am  as indeed we all are   at the excitement and enthusiasm that the benefit fraud inspection unit has created   i announced at a press conference  this new benefit fraud inspection unit  which we are hoping to call     sponge avengers     and at that press conference          there seems to have been a bit ofa blip  because many ofthe journalists didn't pick up on the announcement   i think they're so much looking for        scandal or incompetence   so that statement that the policy was the invention ofa disgruntled civil servant  was actually the invention ofa disgruntled civil servant   no  there's only one disgruntled civil servant   one ofthem's    one ofthem's an invention    by the other one  you see    anyone listening carefully will think i'm mad    they won't  it came over loud and clear    it's gonna put the whole thing to bed anyway  kill it   and olly's offered angela a private life piece about you      oh  great    a sunday walk with the family     that sort ofthing    she's gonna be checking through my books  and snooping in my bathroom cabinet  and making snide remarks about how i don't know who gail porter is     we did dick her about a bit  hugh    yeah   we're getting a roasting from what has been dubbed  but i wouldn't call  flip flop friday   we need all the help from friends we can get right now      i know    what do you think   i just    i just think that       i want a new driver  get me a new driver     i don't want to see this guy ever again    on what grounds   smiling  inappropriate smiling   and smirking  smiling and smirking   i don't want to see that smile or smirk ever again  ok   thank you     ok  thank you     which way do you want to go
