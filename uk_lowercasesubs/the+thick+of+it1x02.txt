 producing better stuff     you're late  and you look like shit   i know both ofthose things already   margaret thatcher used to survive on less than four hours' sleep a night     how is that possible    monkey glands    she was mad  mad people have different needs    and she lived above the shop  so she didn't have to commute   god  i mean  london is so big  can't we devolve some ofit        ifi could get one decent night's shut eye     well  do yourselfa favour and stay in the flat   i can't break my promise to kate   do you actually get to see the children   glenn  i don't have time for that  all i do     i work  i eat  i shower   that's it   and occasionally     i take a dump  just as a sort oftreat   i mean  that really is my treat  that's what it's come to  that's     i sit there and i think     ''no  i'm not gonna read the new statesman   ''this time is just for me  this is quality time just for me ''    is that normal    it's sad     at least i've made something    morning  secretary ofstate   we've got quite a lot to get through     i've cancelled that interview for bbc norfolk    why   well  it was gonna clash with the two minutes' silence     good call    ifyou're not remembering the dead  and talking about benefit fraud in kings lynn you are gonna look a bit ofa dick   olly  could you get me another coffee    remember what i told you  when i was working at waitrose     yes  i know    do you remember that   it was two minutes' silence  ordinary sunday   and somebody went on the tannoy about a spillage alert     the tabloids were like rats up a drainpipe    were they   can you just     it's the times  could you just have a quick look at that     is it about me    have a read ofit first   i find this job exciting enough    without injecting artificial suspense      you're cock teasing  terri  tell me what it is     hello  malcolm        no  he hasn't yet  no    what     he is  isn't he  he's a prick     who's a prick     am i a prick    yep  rip the ball sack off      whose ball sack    whose ball sack        whose balls     hello  malcolm    have you seen simon hewitt's piece   i haven't quite been through it  er  yet   have you got to the bit where he calls you out ofyour depth   no  at the moment he's calling me     ''the political equivalent ofthe house wine at a suburban indian restaurant''   that's not very good  is it  hang on a second   ooh  ''insipid''  yeah    ''uninspiring''    christ  that's bad  look at that   ooh  ''disconnected to the point ofautism''   we're gonna get this tosser  hugh  don't you worry   he'll be at the sport  photoshopping the tits ofhollyoaks extras by the end ofthe month   can i just    hello  no  he's gone   that's great  malcolm's backing me      yeah    so  how do we respond to this   right  we don't exchange insults with bloody simon arsepipes titty twat   is that honestly the best swearing you can come up with   this is a bucket ofshit  ifsomeone throws shit  we throw shit at them  we start a shit fight   we throw so much shit back at them  that they can't pick up shit  throw shit  or do shit      mm    that's top swearing  glenn  well done     watch and learn     we're all agreed  that the department needs to look a bit less        autistic      badly staffed   so we need to  at this morning's policy review   come up with some sort ofnew announcement that's a bit more connected  bit more   funky    funky   look  erm     i hope you're not gonna just toss offsome policy  just to get back at some journalist   so  erm  essentially this is just us again but in a bigger room  isn't it     and without terri    yeah  i've block booked 14 meeting rooms     she'll never find us    it's foolproof   it's the only way to get any work done  chris from health does it all the time   ok  all right  i'll start  there was a key worker policy i worked up a couple ofmonths ago   quite like that  we need to find an angle  a very good angle   youths  you know  people are afraid ofyouths     i mean  i know i am    grrr     you taking the piss     no  i'm just joshing     it sounds as though you're taking the piss    it's just good natured joshing     will the two ofyou just shut up    i am being good natured   shut up for a minute  please  where else can we go   pollution  the environment   litter  dog shit      aiming high    we aimed high  now we're at dog shit      so what you're      this is what we're doing     i'm putting it about       morning  malcolm     that hewitt's piece was a packet ofbollocks  a favour to cliff     cliffbeing        clifflawton   hugh's predecessor  he and hewitt are tight as arse cheeks     are they now    fuck knows  but that's what we're saying   it's personal  it's back slapping  it's borderline homoerotic   and you are the innocent victim ofa nasty media stitch up     ok  right    i'm fixing you up  with a ''me and my media'' piece with your ex angela heaney   but it is a perfect opportunity to show just how clued up you are  actually   hughy abbot  the in touch guy   you're on the ball  you know the price ofa pint ofmilk  you love hbo imports  vh1  pixar     you dig the streets      yeah  no  they're all great   you've got absolutely no fucking idea what i'm talking about  do you   yeah  yeah  i do   who's the only gay in the village   eddie grundy  i i don't know   no  he's got children  mind you  a lot of them do  these days  ben at the foreign office       what's a chav    ch    erm       it's   erm      you must know this  hugh     hugh  what is a chav    chav      chav  chav    just saying ''chav'' isn't very helpful   this is important stuff  hugh  right   we do a weekly digest for the prime minister   we boil down the week's television  cinema  music  so on       the zeitgeist tapes     exactly  zeitgeist tape   eastenders highlights  choice bits from the reality shows  ten second music videos   god  that's why the pm always looks so clued up   i always though he was genuinely quite with it   no  he uses phrases like ''with it'' as well   i'm gonna bike that over to terri  watch it  ok   and when you talk to angela heaney  stick the boot into hewitt  remember   i'm putting it about that cliffoffered him two weeks at his tuscan villa for that piece     ten four  daddy o    hey  hey  hey  hey  this is serious   you have got 24 hours to sort out your policy on eastenders  right   or you're for the halal butchers     even he knows   terri     two main contenders for our policy decision    right   er  we change arts and music policy funding  so that we give most ofthe money to the bad kids   give them intensive arts and music tuition   stop them turning into tomorrow's crims and offenders   perhaps you'd like to outline your      i'm for we punish disruptive kids by cutting them out ofextra music and arts tuition   show them the carrot and the stick early on   the bad kids  they get no money     and  olly  the same bad kids  they get      more money     more money    they could both play     they're fundamentally contradictory    so which one should we go with   why don't you go with both ofthem or neither ofthem or a different policy    you're being quite flippant     do you have a preference    that's not my role   i sell the apples  ifyou want me to sell apples  i will   ifyou want me to sell oranges  i'll go and tell people  that the apples are shit  olly  they're shit   i'll say  ''go on  check out our oranges ''  which do you prefer  apples or oranges     apples     apples     apples    ok  thank you     apples     ifwe spend taxpayers' money  putting thugs into productions ofthe fucking cherry orchard  we're gonna get crucified  and rightly so   hang on a second  terri  which was apples  was olly apples or was glenn apples   she's   she's gone    let's throw this to a focus group   yeah  yeah  whatever   so  this is where you've been having these secret meetings  is it      yeah  no    no  yeah     well    i cannot keep abreast ofall this     can't you pr cis some ofit for me    yeah  yeah  sure   i'll take a pr cis ofthe transcripts and a pr cis ofthe press packs   could you pr cis this for me  the zeitgeist tape   check this out  this is a tape ofthis morning's focus group   this is mary  she is a focus group legend      mary    mary she's called   everything that she's said in the last 12 months in every focus group  has chimed exactly with the core voter   and she loved my arts for hearts and minds policy     arts for hearts and minds    that's what we're calling it   and she said  glenn  that it chimed brilliantly with stay at home mums like her   and she's really core middle england  is she   totally  totally core middle england    if children are put in a position where they've got responsibility   i think they'll rise to that challenge   art is all about expression  isn't it    can we get her in for a one to one     yeah  absolutely    what  we're gonna pr cis the focus group     yeah    we'll just make it a bit more   focused   everybody else basically agrees with what she says  she's got everything   very good way to work  i like this   cut out all the extraneous stuff  you know  just the facts  man   just the protein  atkins government    ok  i'll get her in   in fact here they are now     hello    hi  i'm mary   this is hugh abbott  this is mary  and  mary  this is glenn cullen     and this is mary  our focus group star     great to meet you    thank you  i keep getting asked back   well  you are one ofthe most articulate ofour focus groupees   that's    yeah    not groupie  groupees with two es     yes    you're very kind  thanks    all right  listen  just to push on     i was thinking that ifi am representative ofthe public at large    you're gonna listen to what i say      you're every woman     ''it's all in me ''    something like that     it's  er  it's a song  hugh    yeah  i know     so  mary  the policy we were talking about      great policy     thank you    yeah  really good  well done     we were wondering      i was thinking about it afterwards   and ifthose extra classes  you know  the drama and the music and the art classes   ifthey have them after school  it saves the potentially naughty children from missing out on the core curriculum     that's important     that's a good angle   and also it would be  i think  a really welcome breathing space  for some ofthe single parents  like me    yes   excellent   i thought ofa name for it  i thought you could call it play for tomorrow    play for tomorrow  yeah  excellent   thank you so much for coming in  and good luck with the single mother thing     thank you     i'll be right    erm     i'll see you in a bit  glenn     and you're against it    it'll die on its arse   ''my grandma was mugged by some ferret faced teenager with a neck tattoo   ''what are you gonna do about it '' ''teach him the bassoon ''  it is  as my dear old mother would have said  double wank and shit chips   but you think it's got legs  hugh     several    how did it play with the focus groups     she loves it    sorry    they absolutely love it   you've got 94  approve strongly approve rating  that's enormous     why did you say ''she''    i don't know     you can call boats she    94   it's all there  black and white   it's difficult to argue with that  glenn  whatever your foul mouthed mother might have said   yes  i can feel a stiffy in the post     my guts still say no     i'll talk to tom about green lighting this    so that's a go  terri   just  erm  put the smell out  see ifanybody   gags on it   just   just float it     ok  er      problem   can we please try and     stop making policy on the hoof   we've been on the hoof and we have been too hoofy     have we    ifthere could just be some sitting down     yeah    just  you know  sitting down     that's all i'm saying    yeah   we've got the chairs  we should use them     i think so  that was it    ok  is that it     that's the problem  no more    problem solved  good point     i'll go and float    ok     face up    ifyou like  yep    see you  terri   malcolm  i know you were keen on terri's appointment but       she's shit    i wouldn't go that far   she's a box ticker  hugh  she can't think outside the box   she's built a box inside the actual box and she's doing her thinking inside that box     exactly  i like that    sorry  i'm so tired     no  that's good    i have so much stuffto read and think about     you seem to get through it all right    yeah  i find the time  somewhere   do you get lonely     no    no  neither do i     so did you watch the zeitgeist tape    some ofit  yeah   so you know your eastenders  little mo  big mo        what     i haven't watched

way     it's all gone to shite    oh  the papers didn't like the policy   they fucking loathe it  are you getting all this  hugh   yes  you're very clear      do they all hate it  the times    especially the times    but the first editions haven't gone to bed yet     how do you know     because i'm connected   i'm plugged into the matrix  i am the fucking matrix     what   what    sorry

  this arts policy is dead  ok  as ofnow   get a press release together and bung it in the oven  fuck off  the lot ofyou   and  hugh  watch that tape   i was in the blackwall tunnel  can you repeat all that    these focus groups  they're absolutely useless   oh  it's useless to ask people what they think  is it  before we formulate policy   look  people either don't know what they think  or they think you should bring back hanging for traffic wardens   or they just think what every right minded person would think   oh  yeah  ''i'm geoffaverage  and i think the same as everybody else  ''cos i'm a normal bloke and everybody thinks like me  ''cos i work in it  and every weekend i pop a few pills and do a bit ofdjing   ''spare cash cos i'm a single mum  and i'm in the national trust   ''i enjoy sports on tv  anything with colin firth   ''i enjoy domestic violence and sun dried fucking   karaoke ''  not everybody is the same  glenn   people can surprise you   was that good natured

no clearer way ofsaying it   she's an actress     are you sure    i've just seen her in the fucking bill   oh  jesus   this doesn't necessarily have to be a total fucking disaster   it does  it means she's not really a stay at home middle england housewife   she's just playing a part     so  what she said wasn't  you know      yes  i do know     what  who said what  what    we are organising focus

we are so grateful for you coming in at this ungodly hour     is there   a problem    yeah  there is   you flapping your trap   the issues is   the issue of your being an actress   right     i actually prefer actor    i'm sorry  sexist  sorry     slightly  yeah    essentially  you know   what you told us  that was fundamentally   honest  it was the truth     it was honestly   genuinely what you thought    yeah  yeah  well  yeah   i haven't got two children  but apart from that it was essentially       most    yes  ofcourse       you invented the kids     i    yeah  i was      you made up small children     i know small children    that's sick     jesus christ    i was just being representative     you invented children        small children that don't exist    i was giving you what you wanted   so  eventually you lose track  the lies compound themselves  and you end up all over the place like a crazy woman's shit   and that's the problem that we're now trying to deal with   we've given this story to a tame journalist   one who's more likely to be sympathetic     do you just want to think about what is going to happen tomorrow   you are gonna find the press all over you       in a good way    no  not at all     you know that film notting hill    she's probably fucking in it   you know that bit where he opens the door  and there's millions ofjournalists and photographers  and all flashbulbs are going off   in about four hours  that's gonna be you   they're gonna be all over you like fucking cockroaches     it's ok    no  no  no  no  no  it's not ok   it's not gonna be ok  and i'll tell you why   because you're fair game   so i hope your knickers are clean   because every seat sniffing little shitbag that's ever filed a by line  is gonna be questioning you   cos now it's in the fucking public interest  isn't it   and they're gonna hit you with any shit they can find  and you're gonna be spread out there in front ofthem like a trollop in the stocks      we we've done      i still don't understand what's going on     we can hold those dogs back     what do you mean     we can get you a nice journalist    yes  exactly   we can get you to a nice  young journalist  angela heaney   and maybe you    i don't know what he made you sign  but whatever it was  it was bullshit   maybe ifyou just say that you were misquoted  and also that simon hewitt's a prick     ifyou just said that      who     the journalist that you told your story to    i   i didn't   i didn't talk to any journalist     no  no  no    you spoke to simon hewitt     no  i      you fucking spoke to simon hewitt   he's a fat guy with a tiny dick the size ofa bookie's biro     you fucking spoke to him    i'd like to go now        shh shh    you didn't speak to him     she didn't fucking speak to him    i don't know anyone called   simon       whatever the fuck    hewitt     hewitt  yeah        she doesn't even know       fuck's sake   what's the matter with him    olly   sorry ifi upset you   sorry  darling  sorry  crossed lines  darling  sorry about that      will you leave me alone    ifyou need a car  i'll get whatever you need   for fuck's sake     she didn't even know     fuck him   that didn't really work  did it      is it too late      can i get this straight for my own sanity   ifwe get on the phone  can we pull the front page     no  it's too late    heaney's piece is gonna go ahead anyway   ofcourse it fucking is  i'm good but i can't fucking hold back the tide  can i   all right  that's it  i'm going to bed     kind ofironic  really
