emotional loss is amplified and may seem unbearable   weeping  in this phase  the feelings of low self esteem and hopelessness are common   but these will finally give way  eventually  to the final phase of acceptance     weeping continues     an understanding that what has been lost can never return   and that life can continue although it may be very different    oh  god   sobs  and a journey
