home   my father supported the invasion and the war that followed   an extension of which is still going on in afghanistan   my family have had a taste of what british forces  and iraqi families have gone through these past few years   and we are humbled by it   my heart goes out to those families on both sides  whose loved ones will never come home   i owe you an apology   oh   you did an extraordinary thing out there   not gonna kiss me  are you  no   don't get all sentimental on me like that   i think i preferred you with low self esteem   what will you do now   i'm gonna see a man about a job   i'm glad you came in   as a friend  i owe you an explanation about scarface   as'ad  yes   as'ad   i was forced to weigh the intelligence value  he might have been able to provide against the risk he posed  as a known terrorist  suppose he'd had a change of heart  and tried to bring down the helicopter   we could've lost katie on the very brink of getting her to safety   katie     i need you to tell me  everything as'ad said to you   about what happened the night you saved his life  yeah   he said     he said that the man who killed your friends was another soldier   an iraqi soldier       or a british soldier   you do understand  don't you  john   of course   i would've done exactly the same thing if i was in your shoes   good   good   so  have you come to a
