church and     um  we'd like to invite you all for a vicarage warming later   we'd be delighted if you'd join us for a small of glass  of something cold  as a token of our thanks   oh  my god   taking

office with him  and adoha   she won't stop flirting with me   she keeps pulling me into those big bosooma's like the death star   it's terrifying  door buzzer  if that's colin this early  tell him we're not open yet   it won't be colin   hello  colin  vicar  you'd better come quick  there's been a disaster at the church   ok  hello  colin  yes  it's colin   hello  mrs vicarage  off for another

thanks for the bird table   hey   oh  yeah  nice one   so what's the problem   you'll see at the church   it's a scandal  vicar   ok  is it a scandal  or is it just a pigeon like last time   ooh ooh

refreshing morning  come here  darling   oh  what a night it was  adam  but look at the state of you   dear lord  what have you done to yourself  you naughty vicar   we must dance again sometime soon  yes  we must  can't stop now though  we     adoha  the flowers beds are going to look lovely  thank you so much   thank you   it's a disgrace  it's an outrage   it's going to cost a fortune   whoever did this  i will find them   this window is rightly revered as one of the few post war windows inspired by burne jones   it's an invaluable work that mixes flashes of almost fauvist brutalism  with figurative depictions of the mentally ill  yes  i know  nigel   no more will we see sir tristan guarding the shepherds with his massive lance   the christ child on his hobby horse   what they did these criminals  is they chucked a bottle through  look here   fragments of bottle glass  here amongst the precious glass   let me find the culprits  vicar   i think best left to the police  colin   better phone the archdeacon   i know who's done it  it'll be them asians   right that's just racist  colin  isn't it  we've talked about this   oh  let me get to the bottom of it  vicar  please   ok  any help most welcome   first  let's say morning prayer   let's say it nice and quietly in case anyone here's got a hangover   cars beep  ah   watch it  you wanker  oops  sorry  mate  watch it  your worship   you wanker   great  so you and vincent on the 27th   fixed  thanks  vicar   we've chosen the same date mum and dad got married   so i know dad will be looking down   there you go   it's on the house   dad gave me this beautiful book and we're going to do a reading from it  at the wedding  and after that vince is going to sing angels   by robbie williams   do you know it  it's our song   mobile phone rings  hello  archdeacon  yes  i'm just organising a wedding   er  well  i could meet you at the church   oh  you're here   oh  yeah  no i'll     sorry   hello  archdeacon   ah  they all said you'd probably be in the pub  get in  i've got my bike   can't linger  i've got to get to chris hitchen's book launch  and i need to talk to you about this window now   get in   the answer's no  the insurers won't cover it all and there's nothing in  the diocese budget for that kind of thing  you know that   right  i see  so there's no chance of any money at all from anywhere   no  you're going to have to do some fund raising  i'm sure you'll pull it off   we have such high hopes of you here at st saviour's   since your predecessor scuttled off to rome   yes  i'm holding back on the incense and the word mary   adam laughs  how's your sunday congregation  what are the numbers   i don't know  archdeacon  the church isn't just about keeping score though  is it  of course not   how many are you getting in   i haven't counted  have a guess   er  don't want to guess  have a guess  just for me   i don't want to  yes  you do   no i don't   no it's a lot more than 20  22   let's not guess  i'll get to you sometime with an accurate figure   ok  by next monday   oh  by the way how's that cassock chaser in your congregation  what's her name   adoha  still managing to resist  you know     she's incredibly famous for having orgasms during sermons   archdeacon laughs  the lord be with you   all  and also with you   please be seated  er  i hope you're not too cold   i'm sorry to say that we had our beloved window broken this week   i'm assuming that it was the work of vandals rather than an enraged art critic   er  we'll hopefully be getting it repaired as soon as possible   door opens  so let's    oh  good morning   please  come in   always good to see new faces  so  let's begin our service   hello  hello  hello   so many of you this morning  how lovely   so  let  let's begin our service by saying our prayer of preparation   door opens  hello   please  come in   so let's begin  almighty god   to whom all hearts are open  all desires known   hurry up  come on  luke   hurry up  come on  hurry up   can i just say um     how lovely it is to see so many new faces here today   it's a really splendid turn out     door opens  and as i say it  yet more of you arrive   with that in mind  let's all stand now to sing what i imagine will be  a rather rousing rendition of all creatures of our god and king   hymn number 13  organ plays  why are we doing this  it's not christmas     all creatures of our god and king    lift up your voice and with us sing    hallelujah  hallelujah       here at st saviour's it is the essence of our faith that  everyone is acceptable to god and therefore to each other   let's pray now for a moment   when i walk     i walk with the little ones of the world     mobile phone rings  i walk with those who have lost all hope    the outcasts  the poor  the sick  the mourning     this is boring  i want to go home    ssshhh  ssshhh  ssshhh     i walk with the brokenness of the world     adoha whimpers    and i walk with you  adoha moans  adam  hello  adoha   i thought your sermon today was very stirring   thank you  you have such a powerful way with words   and such wonderful eyes  oh  do i   your voice  it makes me tingle   ooh  that's lovely   i must just grab a word with the headmistress   hello  ellie  you look lovely  those are lovely earrings   hello  adam  um  have you sobered up enough  to have a think about my sister having that half term wedding date   ah  um  i'm afraid that weekend's fully booked  oh   this is encouraging  isn't it  the size of the congregation today   yeah  it's amazing what the whiff of a good ofsted report can do   oh  that's what it is  of course it is   ellie's turned the place around  the rumours are that the school is now good with elements of outstanding   let's not jump to conclusions until it's published   well done  headmistress   well  it's good news for you too  vicar  i mean  these school whores  will be queuing up to prove they're christians  won't they  just to get a place at ellie's   the joy of selection  i've a meeting for prospective parents friday   i like to do a raffle  they all try to out bid each other  it's like the first day of the christmas sales   who the hell are all these people today  one second  colin   i'm not sure that's the best way to fill a school place  is it  to the highest bidder   why  what are your criteria   well  it's a church of england school so they should be christians  shouldn't they   hello there  vicar  patrick yam   hello  lovely to meet you  have you not met our wonderful local mp yet   this is patrick  he closed my local swimming pool   what a service  i loved it   yeah  a bit confused about when to sit down or stand or shout stuff out   but  er  yeah we should  we should do this again sometime   i thought adam's sermon today ended rather abruptly   mine next month will     thank you very much   will be an examination of how the fourth commandment to     thank you  to observe the sabbath has in our age  of pharaonic consumption become in many ways the most radical   that sounds boring  nigel   win the restoration fund   right   nigel  are you going to help me decide which parents deserve a school place   i need to write my sermon   what  it's not for three weeks   yes  but i like to think about mine   i'm always surprised by your ability to knock one out at the last minute   no  come on  this is more important   nigel  wouldn't you like to help me weed out some hypocrites   ok   now  the school entry guidelines say  that parents must be regular and committed worshippers   well  cross off anyone booking a late baptism for a start  oh  that's a good idea   we did the ingram's boy last year  he was seven  it was a nightmare  more like an exorcism   now how are we going to choose from the rest   i was thinking we could do a bible test for them all   oh  that is a good idea  what level of questions   well  let's practise  you be a parent   can i ask the questions  no  i'm doing the questions   hello  mr parent  hello  father  please call me adam   so  you want little peter to get into ellie's school  don't you   desperately  my entire self worth depends upon it   adam laughs  right  so tell me   which was the first of the gospels to be written   mark  ad65 to 80   easy   where was the epistle of philemon written and by who  whom   by saint paul in prison  too easy  it's fun though   who was the gospel of luke written to   my dear theophilus   where today would you find    modern day iraq   ok  who sold joseph into captivity   good one  er  the midianites   ah ah  no  it wasn't  it was the ishmaelites  wasn't it   i think you'll find it was the midianites  was it   it was  yep   anyway  we'll do a test and if the parents don't know the answer  the kid doesn't get in   eleanor's turned this place around in two years   i mean  you know what with all this ofsted business   yes  it's going to be quite    excuse me     difficult to decide who qualifies for a place next year   out of interest how will you decide   well  by sticking to the rules  patrick   reverend  did you get that case of wine we brought round   was that from you  thank you very much   and  er  well done for winning the raffle   yes  well  we bought all the green tickets you see   yes  the whole book  yes   just keen to help the school  yes   i'd love to do a church reading some time just er     ok  patrick  thank you   er  it would mean you'd have to turn up on time though   i hope our donation has helped your window fund   yes  thank you  it has  how much is that going to cost to repair   er  about     30 000  i'm afraid   jesus  what a nightmare   i just said jesus  i'm so sorry  vicar   it's ok  patrick  we all slip up   ah good  but that's a fucking nightmare for you   i mean  for all of us  the  the window   i hope adam's not tapping my parents for cash for his window   he's supposed to be interrogating them to see if they're god fearing christians   ah  alex  i don't think you've met mr darr   must go and mingle   alexandra  your shoulders are very tight and tense  no  they're not   i fear your spine may not be straight  yeah  it is   you must come round to my practice  let me do you some time   yes  i mustn't   sorry  i was being hosed down in smarm   what happened to you  i had to leave   i was set upon by lunatic parents who all think their child's future lies in your hands   i'm sorry  i thought you were having a good time   yeah  i love playing the vicar's wife  especially  when it involves being felt up by a sweaty palmed chiropractor   yes  you do seem rather tense  my dear   perhaps you need some     pelvic stabilisation   shall i rub your lumbar four   no  get off   and if you think i'm going to let you shag me in your dog collar you're very wrong   i'm not trying to shag you  i'm trying to mobilise your trunk muscles   i hate it when you wear that thing in the bedroom  it's like you've got no cock   all right  i've taken it off  there it is  it's off   no leave it on  and go and bash the bishop   let's hear your thrilling fund raising ideas   how are you going to get this window fixed   ok   i've moved to the edge of my seat   there's the classic bring and buy sale of course   people could bring in christmas presents they didn't want   how very 1950's of you   that might have worked wherever it is you're from in the country  we're from suffolk   sussex  but it certainly won't work here in london   no  ok  also i was thinking we could auction off some people's time and skills  whose time and skills   well  my time and skills  my wife's  i think we both know how much that would raise   or you could pay to have nigel for the afternoon   i'd pay not to have nigel for the afternoon   or maybe i'll just sit up on the church roof until someone pays for me to come down   he laughs  like a hunger striker  yes  that certainly appeals to me   i think you might be up there for some considerable time   could you step here  driver   the fact is  adam   none of these artsy craftsy ideas are any good  are they   you have an inner city church with inner city problems   might i suggest you quickly wise up and find an inner city solution   right  i'll drop you off here   come along  unbuckle   busy people  busy lives  chop  chop   drive on   cars toot horn  oy  there's the vicar   give us a wave  oy  i've got a confession to make   what do think of this   they laugh wahey   what do you think of that headmistress say  eh  yeah   er  she's pretty formidable   oh  yeah  boy  she can stick me in detention any time   i bet you get women after you all the time  don't you   cos of this   yeah  a bit of authority  girls love it   now then  i have taken the liberty of speaking to my mate sir jeremy  from the lunardi foundation about your window  really   and he thinks he can help  passionate about burne jones stuff   loves all those boys who look like girls   well  patrick  that is incredibly kind of you   now i'm sure he will meet most of the restoration costs   and i'm very happy to make a donation myself as well   i just wanted to have a quick word with you about our luke  you've met him  er  not  not really   oh  he's a great kid  lovely nature  at heart   i mean  he's not exactly an academic high flyer  um  i think it's fair to say   just like his mum   but i have always wanted him to go somewhere like your little place   you know  a good old church school  i mean that's  that's more my style   and budget  i see   so i thought if you could speak to your friend ellie and make sure  luke gets into st saviour's  we'd be very grateful   yes  and i'd make sure sir jeremy helped out with your window   yes  i see   it would help me to write a good church referral  for you patrick if you  if you did actually come to church   ok  yeah  no  i see what you're saying   yeah  we'll be  we'll be back in on  on sunday   on your knees  avoid the fees   i like your top  ellie  is it boden   no  what is it you want to talk about   it looks great   um  patrick yam's son luke   i was thinking of giving him a good church reference for a place here   why  i've never seen them at church until this week   well  the thing is i do think the boy will benefit enormously from an education here   has patrick offered you some money  me  no   for your broken window   what's the point of these church places  ellie  if i don't have a say   he has offered you some money  tell you what  if you find a way  to get my sister that half term wedding date  i'll find a way to take patrick's boy   oh  right   that way you get your window money  my sister gets married   and i get another middle class kid to give my stats a nudge   everyone's a winner   no  this is good  this way everyone wins  patrick gets his delinquent child  into a good school  ellie gets her wedding date and we get our window restored   what about gemma and vincent  they've got to get married at 2pm that saturday   they get canned  nigel  no  they don't get canned  alex   they just get postponed a little bit  that's all   oh  so apart from them  everyone wins   they'll be ok  we can move them   nigel can move them   this is not easy  ok  alex  this job  all that happens all day   every day  all the time is that people want things from you  which is fine  it's a vocation   but i do have to depend on a whole lot of volunteers  some of whom can't even wipe their own arses   nigel wipes his own arse  i most certainly do   not always  nigel  sometimes i have to do it  and i have to do colin's arse and adoha's   i've never been aware of your wiping   sometimes all i do  all day    don't say colin's arse again     is wipe people's arses for them   this way i get something back for once for the church   i get our window fixed   i get the archdeacon off my back    right   i'm going to go and tell gemma and vincent they've got to move their wedding date   it's a small sin for a greater good   'i'm sorry  lord  that was wrong   'i shouldn't have talked about people's arses like that   'it was a grotesque succession of images   'i'm just finding everything a bit difficult   ' on your knees  avoid the fees   how did i get into this situation   'i'm supposed to walk with the broken  aren't i   'not horse trade with an admittedly rather pretty headmistress   'that toxic mp and gemma the barmaid   'and why do you want me to be a fundraiser the whole time   'why have you given me this huge crumbling building  'and now this window to deal with   'it's such a burden   'let's face it  it's not a terribly good window really  is it   'speak to me  lord  your servant listens '  patrick  i want you to know that i've thought long and hard about your proposal and luke's future  and i'm going to say that in this particular instance we've decided  that luke is a wonderful boy with a great deal to recommend him  but we won't take him   what   i'm not prepared to offer or trade a school place for cash  i'm afraid   right  fine  whatever   is that why i'm here  i i i couldn't care less   yeah  i bet all those rumours are actually lies  i bet that school's not good with elements  of outstanding  i bet that school is poor with elements of shit  and i bet  that posh totty headmistress you carry a rod in your cassock for started these rumours herself   it's what i'd have done   did she do that  did she  no  i     well  actually    maybe i could start some rumours of my own about  how the place is an educational car crash and let's see whose rumours win  shall we   what makes me angry is why did i bother turning up to church all those times   well  you did actually only come the once since    even so   i don't suppose there's any chance that sir jeremy will still send  through a cheque for the window  will he   let me have a think  no   you bloody idiot   there you go  vicar  hello  gemma   vince is off to pick up the rings   oh  is he  good  i've gone for an ivory trouser suit  mm   and we've started a pub collection   for your church window   oh  that's very kind of you   there's 90 quid in there       100 now   after our wedding it'd be great to have a chat with you about getting our little tia into your school   she's ever so clever   oh  look it's the vicar of dibley   oy dibley  are you off to bum a choir boy   oy  mr vicar  are you going to go and do a choir boy   why don't you just fuck off   hello  colin  all right  vicarage   i'll tell you who's made me very angry this afternoon   who's that  colin   that professor and his book about god being all deluded   oh  richard dawkins  he's a twat  isn't he   if i met him i'd kick him in the bollocks   i mean  he thinks that people who believe in god are irrational nutters  but i believe in god   i don't know why you gave that book out to people   well  i think it's such a deeply flawed book  colin   that you shouldn't let it worry you   professor dawkins only believes in things if they can  be scientifically proven  but there's still so much about god's world that we don't understand   look   why is a snail shell a perfect mathematical golden spiral   beautiful  isn't it   and it doesn't need to be   yeah   and he's baffled by the idea of forgiveness  yeah   mm  well  good because i'm not going to forgive him for his shit book   do you want some   thank you   what are you going to do about the window now  vicarage   i shall continue to ask people for money   and i will trust that the good lord will provide   did you ever find out who broke it  colin   nah  a total mystery   i've decided it's too difficult trying to solve crime   nobody owns up   well  thanks for looking into it   right  i ought to get back   what do you do with these  oh  yeah  i play this game where i see how far i can chuck 'em   watch this  whey   bottle smashes   e mail subtitling bbc co uk
