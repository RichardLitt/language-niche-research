experience  sir   if we heard it firsthand   what  well  i came in today because i thought you'd     you'd made some progress   i'm sorry  mr butterfield  but unless we have  hard physical evidence that leads to an offender  it's very difficult     well  i've been burgled three times this year already   every time  it's someone new  who's been given the file  and who wants to  empathise  all over again   mr butterfield  just wait   if you can just take my number  you can call me day or night   let's see what we can do to get them this time   yeah  thank you   dc kate fleming to see you

intent to rob   possession of prohibited weapon  resisting arrest  all times two   yes  sir   two offenders  but only one knife   you see my point  kate   they didn't both use a knife  there was an opportunity here  with one of the offenders to miss out the knife altogether   well  i took the view they were both involved  sir   divisional commanders are on notice to reduce knife crime   they say hillside lane have already achieved 5    do you want me to re crime it  sir   it's not my policy to intercede in individual offences   now  cid has an unacceptable detection rate  your case this morning is a prime example   multiple domestic burglaries   we pursue two out of three reported crimes   we down process anything that won't quickly lead to an offender   are you ordering me to put it on the back burner   you're not the new girl any more  kate   thank you  sir   officer of the year isn't good enough for the boss  he's after the middleweight title   i heard they gave you more than a

like the battle   i know who you are  sir   and this is ds steve arnott   pleased to meet you  sir  likewise   i recognise and respect the importance of your mission  and i'm very happy to help you in any way i can   well  now  that's very reassuring  can i call you tony   whatever you feel most comfortable with  sir   maybe i should call you officer of the year  eh   shall we make a start   yes  please   ac 12 interview   present   superintendent hastings  ds arnott and dci gates   detective chief inspector gates   we have received an allegation that you received a gratuity  in respect of one free breakfast from the sunflower cafe in st anne's place  in the kingsgate   now  whilst receiving a gratuity is not in itself a breach   failure to declare a said gratuity is a breach  of the police officer's code of conduct as laid down  by the home office guidelines   and so therefore i am serving you with the yellow notice   and that's it   yes  that's it   in which case  erm  i decline to make any written or oral statement  but i acknowledge the receipt of the yellow notice  and i inform the investigating officer that i will respond within the regulation ten working days   interview terminated   this is coming from the muggers  isn't it  those toe rags know every trick in the book   er  well  we have to go through the motions  tony  you know   it's not your fault  sir   he's an arrogant so and so  isn't he   i mean  a player like gates knows it's against rules and regulations not to declare a gratuity  so what does it say about him that he doesn't even bother his arse to fill in the form   well  with respect  what's a free breakfast got to do with  investigating gates' crime figures   sooner or later he's going to know we're on to him  this way  he thinks it's just a storm in a teacup   or should that be a coffee cup   i'll give him laughing all over his face at us  his guard's down   that's how we're going to get him  steve   there's another possibility   yeah   gates' figures are for real   oh  i see what you're getting at   you think he's bob beamon and i think he's  what  ben johnson   i mean  admittedly an athlete does come along once in a while  who breaks the world record by a mile   and sometimes he's genuinely superhuman but i will lay you odds  all day long that more often than not  that guy is a cheat   sir     dci gates appears to be an exemplary officer   appears to be   my point exactly   sorry   hit and run   why us   because we've got a big sign over our heads saying   cid  dump your crap here    we've got ten unsolved burglaries stinking up our figures   give the hit and run to the civvy   she's had the training  anyway  i'm out of here   gates' has been given a written warning  about his team's gender balance  i'm a shoe in   if you would just like to take a seat  please  ms laverty   there we are  sorry about that   you are jacqueline laverty  date of birth 23rd of november 1967   yeah   right person  that's a good start   we don't have your occupation listed   i run my own business   laverty holdings  you could just put down  self employed    i'm sorry  are you one of the detectives  looking into the theft of my car   i carry out some forms of police work but i'm not a police officer   cut backs   you reported your car stolen at 10 06pm   the night before it was found abandoned   i got back from a business trip around 9 00  and i later remembered i'd left something in the car   when i went to get the keys   they were gone and they'd broken part of the window in my front door   they hooked the keys from the hall table   you didn't hear anything   i was in a back room  with music playing   what the hell are you playing at   the woman seemed so convinced  she made it impossible to change the story   you don't change  do you   you're just always looking after number one   no  no  no  tony  no  i'll fix this   i will  i'll find a way  yeah  like you did today   i'll take the blame   i'll go to prison if that's what you want   not so bad  this'll cheer you up   maybe this wasn't the best place to come   not at all  not at all  young fellow like yourself  new in town   you get yourself a girlfriend

the wrong foot   oh  maybe we should get to know each other better  then  over a pizza and a glass of rioja  sorry   look    tony gates is the best detective in this city   he saved a mum from being mugged at knifepoint and you lot have stuck him  for forgetting to fill in the right bloody form   i mean  maybe there's more to you but so far that's all i've seen   good morning  sir   sir  wait

mind games  son   a few weeks ago i was running counter terror ops   i'm a proper copper and i know another when i see one   and you think you can make hastings back off   i can certainly try  sir  off the record   well  that won't be easy  mate  cos the man's a zealot   don't i bloody know it   why didn't you log the gratuity  sir   i forgot   yeah  i know it was a crap excuse   but it's the truth   rita  isn't it  sir   i'm dci gates   i know who you are  sir   there's  erm  a hit and run  rita    oh  yes  sir   i'm still trying to match the victim to the missing persons report   well  it might connect to something that my team are looking into   so if you get anywhere  you'll come straight to me  won't you   no one else   oh  yes  sir  absolutely  you're a star  rita   come in   sorry to bother you  sir   not a problem   i thought you should know i've been looking back over the arrest reports  over the last couple of days   i've noticed an upsurge in class a detections on the bog   thanks for the tip  it's fleming  isn't it   yeah   it's good work   i want to join to 20 sir   anyone with any sense would steer clear right now   ac 12  you'll piss all over them  sir   i'm

 spat on  pissed on     but  my social life aside     every week it's a new initiative or a new audit   i want to work for a unit that actually fights crime   the big part of the job description is surveillance   yeah   well  men are gonna notice you   what  and women don't notice you   come for a drink this week   it's not a date   you're breaking my heart  sir   it'll just be a good way for you to get to know the lads a bit  and      and then we'll see   yeah  ok  thanks   what the bloody hell was that   nothing   i'm next in line for a squad  yeah  if you say so  leah   i'm one quarter romany   steve   the very man  so what can you tell me about tony gates   uh     er  nothing  oh  come on  steve  what can i say   i'm disappointed   sir  i'm committed to anticorruption 100      that's what i need to know  son  come on   one of our team has made a breakthrough   what's going on  sir   all will be revealed  steve  all will be revealed   alice  what a pleasant surprise  i'll have to be on my toes today   you've always been a lovely mover  sir   tony  make yourself at home   i was surprised to be called back so quickly  sir  i hope it's good news   ac 12 interview with dci gates   police federation representation dci alice prior   i've been authorised to notify you that we have grounds to widen  our investigation into dci gates' performance of professional duties   widen the investigation  what   we have grounds under professional duties and general conduct   specifically in the practice of laddering   which is the amplification  indeed  the multiplication of charges  against an offender    i know what laddering is  sir   that's right  tony  you do  here's the yellow notice   you've got the regulation ten days   dci gates strenuously denies any wrongdoing   nevertheless he offers the investigation his full cooperation   thank you  that's much appreciated  i'd like to determine the conditions of tony's suspension   oh  no  we're not asking for a suspension at this time   we don't think he's a threat to his fellow officers or indeed  the public in general   now  why should the citizens of this country be denied  his selfless service   interview terminated   that's very generous of you  sir   looks like you've found your level  arnott   tony  let's not descend to    nobody plays me   sir   you never detected the laddering because you didn't even look   i recruited you because you took a moral stand against your colleagues   despite the personal cost   you're a born ac 12 officer  why don't you start acting like one   you've dropped me into an ongoing investigation   now  you could test me or you could actually brief me   ok  tony gates cherry picks the crimes that are easy to solve   then he dumps the rest   then he invents a whole series of additional charges  that never make it to the courtroom but boost his clean up rates   laddering  that's how tony gates got where he is  no  he had to be twice as good to get to there   what  so what are you saying  to be corrupt he's got to be twice as bad   no  sir  victimisation of a black officer     oh  now  hang on a second   don't you talk to me about victimisation  what are you saying   let me tell you something  son   me and my best mate  we went through basic training together  ok   first year out  they sent us on this particular job  the two catholics  are you with me   we go straight over a pipe bomb  i end up in intensive care  him they bury   the log book goes missing  nobody says a word   don't you talk to me about victimisation   nobody's blacker than me  son   kate  hi  all right   like the look of the recruitment policy  hey  nothing sexist   oh  i'm off  then  good night   it's just hr will be down on me like a ton of bricks   big appointment for me  boys  yeah   kate  hi   dc morton  nige  yeah  all right   ds matt cottan  all right   hi  dot    dot  oh  ok   so tone says you want to be in with the in crowd   the in crowd  where   very good   i just want to work for the best  sir  oh  we're off duty now  kate  you can call me     tina  call him tina   and last    and definitely least    you met deepak  yep   i'm sorry  kate  i didn't know  whether you wanted a half or a pint  so i just got you two halves   when you send a boy to do a man's job  this is it   thanks  deepak   you're welcome   oh  and i've got something for you here  boss  as well   there you go  how about that     now  that is stuck on  drink to that    cheers   thanks   come with me   we're gonna get gates with or without you  steve   so you can either help us   or be just another prick who lost his bottle   it's your choice  son   i didn't know ac 12 used undercover officers   hence the term   you're the one that gave us the information about the laddering   i'm on the inside at last  steve   all this just to bring down gates   instead of spending all this time and money policing the police   it'd make more sense to assign us to cases that aren't being investigated   to 20's been nicknamed the big sexy crime unit   gates has been awarded the highest budget three years running  his squad has the best kit in the station   meanwhile victims of crime miss out on justice because he only tackles cases that score points   who doesn't  it's the system   i wouldn't be risking what i'm risking if i didn't believe gates was a special case   i thought anticorruption was about getting blokes on the take   the ones in the pockets of the criminals   you took a stand and it put you out on your own   you're not on your own any more   unless you want to be   kate's been tracking arrests on the bog   over the last month there's been a three fold increase  in the supply and demand of class a narcotics   i've talked to the fifth floor   we've been given the go ahead for a surveillance op  we start     dci gates  ds arnott  can i help you   my car    that your doing   you shat on the boss   yeah  maybe someone just returned the compliment   i want to talk to you alone  now   fire away   i thought maybe you were clean  looks like you're dirty  after all   you take a shot at the king  make sure you kill him  son    fire away   that's priceless  boss   that's mastercard   which one of you muppets did it   i'm spartacus   no  i'm spartacus   our old friend wesley duke  with a big fat rucksack full of crack cocaine   now  when you was all tucked up in your warm beds last night     you were tucked up with dot   he's only jealous   dot and me traced the source to this address in greek lane   now  wesley's been small time  but this appears to be a new   large scale supply he's tapped into   next stage would be to pick wesley up and turn him   and what if he blabs  we don't want to alert the greek lane mob that we're watching them   that's a good point  let's keep up the surveillance for now  nige   see who else comes and goes from this address  well done  matey   erm  let it roll   fleming  yeah   i'm going to talk to the fifth floor  get them to formally approve your transfer to to 20   thanks  sir  i won't let you down   any news   no  nothing   they're not suspicious   it's been filed as an unexplained hit and run   that's good  isn't it   i shouldn't    i shouldn't be here   but you are   i have it on good authority that it was gates  himself   who soiled your car   deepak     ok    cheers  mate   next turn's on the way  dot   they're pulling us off for the night   pulling us off   ah  best thing i got at hillside lane was a pint after work   right  come on

please   christ's sake  dot   how many times  mate   it was ten minutes  15 tops before the next turn clocked on   damned if you do  damned if you don't in this job   morning  boss   tone  i don't know what to say  mate     later  dot  all right   from the blood spatter  both men were alive when the fingers were amputated   looks like whoever killed them wanted to know something  and didn't find out   the finger amputations are clean   each one done with a single stroke  most likely     bolt cutter   dot  i want you to go through the files back at the station   see if there's a similar mo here  or at any other force's case history  right  ok   nigel  i want entry control front and back  all the dabs in the downstairs rooms  and  if there's a bathroom upstairs  there too   and when forensics have got all their samples   i want you to go through everything   let's find out who these two boys were  please   aye aye  skipper   fleming  you do the door to door   you see what i've bloody got to deal with   we're trying to get a job done here and some pen pusher bans overtime   there were 15 minutes for someone to break in   the lads in there are the new kids on the block   and

butterfield  i'm so sorry   yeah  this time i was home when they broke in   just give me a minute   he's going to make a complaint   sir  with respect  you told me to put the case on the back burner   i told you to prioritise   this missing persons report came through from county cid   mr gurjit patel  reported missing the day after the hit and run   mr patel was an accountant for laverty holdings   laverty holdings is owned by jacqueline laverty   the woman whose vehicle was reported stolen   he was her accountant when    thank you  rita   my squad is going to be taking over this case from now on   and you can leave it to me to tell county that we've got an id   this is a very sensitive case  rita   so i'm going to need to shoot those files over to my computer   may i   yes  sir    of course   thank you   erm  milk  no sugar would be nice   yes  right   you're a star
