   1   time's up  pens down   done and done   all that remains is the ceremonial tearing up of the exam sheet   oh  hi  how did you get on   yeah  great  really enjoyed it   hey  what are these questions   uh  twelve to fifteen   oh  no  no  no  no   why did they put them on the back    oh  mike  it's gone   oh  but     look  it was physics  so  you know   you're right   i'm over it   i was thinking of doing this residential summer camp for disadvantaged kids   you're not exactly disadvantaged  beth  apart from the height thing   i meant as a volunteer counsellor  idiot   look  there's these beautiful cabins in the lake district  we go for walks  get out there in nature   i thought it'd be really fun if we did it together   you know  get away from people  apart from the little weird kids   so  you in   err  maybe  how weird are the kids   i don't know  they're orphaned or disabled  or something   no way  beth  this is a very important time in a young man's life  it's a time for drinking and chasing women   jamie does not want to be wasting his prime on a bunch of loser kids   maybe he does   maybe he wants to do something more worthwhile with his time   i don't think i'm the sort of person they're looking for   i don't think i'm ready for responsibility   basically making sure they don't fall in a lake   hello  beth  read the body language   exams are over  life begins   life begins   look  life's not fair  ok   these kids have got to learn that   oh  look  frederik's handing out party flyers   i hate that guy   we should crash it   yes   oh  opportunity to lose our virginity together   this could be it   he means simultaneously  not with each other   although  we could end up with the same woman take an end each   we'd be like marathon runners holding hands over the finishing line  yeah   no  it'd be a great way to celebrate   what would  nothing   we're going to crash frederik and sasha's party   and there may be scenes of a sexual nature  oh yeah   certificate 18     or hopefully 15  at least   great  what time are we going   oh  actually  it's sort of a boy's only night   what  like a gay night   no  no  it's just     worried about me cramping your style  you and your wing man   beth  it's just you're a mate  it'd be weird with you there   oh  i see  fine   wouldn't want to go to a party at a place like that anyway   what  a big house with a swimming pool   yeah  and what paid for that pool  blood money   the blood of 1 000 child soldiers caught on the wrong side of a deranged militia   oh  hello  little boy   what's your name   bang  who cares   jesus  beth  another little future spattered across the wall   we're not endorsing genocide  we just want to get laid  tell it to the hague   what the hell was that   jamie  jamie  jamie  can't you see   she's crazy about me and she senses the ship is sailing   off out   yeah  sasha's having drinks  i'm going with danielle   that's interesting because i thought you were grounded   christ's sake  it was a spliff   it's not like you found me snorting coke  straddling my pimp   oh  very nice  laura   i've told danielle i'm going   you'll have plenty of time to see danielle in edinburgh   look  mum  i appreciate you trying to cram in some parenting   but really  it's a bit late  i'm 18   well  let's make the most of the precious time we have left together   you are not going out   you are such a bitch   do you want me to tell your father what you just said   there's no need  he already knows   jamie   how did you get on   worse than beth  probably better than mike   all finished  well done   cheers  mike's coming over  we're heading out to celebrate   i've got a little something for you  what is it   the future   oh  no  not the toy shop   they're recruiting  it's a good holiday job   do understand what the word 'holiday' means   you're right   tell you what  your dad and i will sponsor you  to screw around for two months  how's that   all right  i'll look at it   but i'm not going to try that hard to get it   oh  christ  what a day   never work for anyone  son  if you can avoid it   so  laura  i think your father wanted to talk to you about something   did i  yes  you definitely did   oh  right  uh  that   yes  your mother tells me you're thinking of not going to university   since when   well we can only assume by your behaviour  that you won't be wanting our financial support   oh  i see  you're punishing me  great   the whole world is one big fucking naughty step for you two  isn't it   oh  sorry  shall i go to my room   actually  mum  why don't you chuck me out   like you did with dad when he shagged his secretary   thank you very much  laura   oh  no problem   thank you for convincing me to stay in tonight   this is much more fun than being with my friends   you're welcome  this is the kind of evening i just live for   much nicer than a civilised meal   yeah  well we're not that sort of family  are we   what sort would that be  the sort that actually likes each other   oh  can you smell that   yeah  are you trying to attract women or incapacitate them   uh  bit of both  hey  check this out   is that a piercing   no  it's one of my mum's earrings superglued to my second chakra   i'm going to be unstoppable tonight   plus  i've made the ultimate seduction playlist   this has been specifically designed to put the target  into a sexually receptive state   the target  wow  lucky girl   listen  see  starts off all slow and acoustic   she's thinking 'yeah  seems like a nice  non threatening guy '  really  not  'who's the freak who's put the earphones on me '  no  i'll play it on the stereo  i'm taking a three and a half mil jack   oh  well  be sure to mention that  because women love talking about audio equipment   so  now she's lulled into a false sense of security   it's time for the sofa transition phase   so  we're sat there  and the vibe getting all smooth and sexy   i move in for the kill   so  anyway  foreplay  foreplay  foreplay    blah  blah  blah   ah  yeah  here we go  uh  uh  yeah   see  really helps with the timing   uh  start co ordinating each thrust  uh  uh  uh   stop doing that on my bed   shh

we get towards  towards the big finish     aargh   top gear   what woman's going to want to listen that   who cares   by that point it's not about her  it's all about me   sasha's party is going to be a generation defining event   you have to be there  so just stop being such a fucking cinderella   i'm not a fucking cinderella  i'm just     staying home whilst everyone else goes to the party    oh

should circulate  try and meet some people   no  that's not my game plan   i'm a man of mystery  an enigma   i have to let the women come to me  then slightly ignore them  like the horse whisperer   ok  well  let's at least go and stand by the drinks   oh  nice one  yeah  brilliant   angle this way   put this on   what's her problem   she's fine  she just hates her parents   how original   i'm

hell did he do that   hi  my friend over there wanted me to ask you something   oh right   yeah  can you move somewhere else  because your face is  kind of  upsetting her   hi  beth   ah  heff  how's the playboy mansion working out for you   great  great  it's all very cool here   so  why are you calling me   oh  you seemed upset earlier and i wanted to make sure you were ok   yeah  it's because

 i wouldn't bother  i'm moments away from pulling myself   you wouldn't have anyone to talk to  yeah  i'm coming   ow  ow  that's attached  that's attached   oh  hey  beth   it's winding down in there

what   a room   uh     oh   ha ha   ok  we have to do it now   ok  well  look  maybe we should slow things down   we've both had a bit to drink   though i see your coordination still fairly intact

'jamie  where are you '  i'm still here  with laura  the girl from last night  we did it   holy crap  really  'yeah '  it was amazing  how was your night   rather not discuss it   'is she still asleep   'jamie   'jamie '  'jamie ' yeah  'is she dressed '  not really  can you text me a photo  no   'i'm just going to make her a coffee or something '  i'd just leg it if i were you  mate   why  'what if she's weirded out about sleeping with a 16 year old '  that's statutory rape  it's not statutory rape  it was   you know    special   gay  jamie  she was pissed and she's way out of your league   i don't know  i think she liked me   she also seemed to like staggering into furniture and screaming her head off  yeah  but     ok  ok   i think the classy thing to do would be to write her a thank you note   well  i can't just leave  trust me  it's the gentlemanly approach   'that way  if she wants to get in touch  she can '  i suppose   either way  you'll always have that night so text me a quick photo     laura darling  it's arrived   go on   well   a's  all a's   oh  that's marvellous  that's better than your cousin gabby   not that it's all about that  but i must tell your aunty louise
