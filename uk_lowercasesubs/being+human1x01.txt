everyone deserves a death  i was going to die of old age   that was the plan   mitchell was going to go down in a blaze of gunfire and glory   not cold and alone and shit scared   he didn't think death would smile at him first   death was always a certainty  the punch line we could all see coming   but not for mitchell   for a vampire  death isn't the end   but the beginning   sorry  thanks for coming  'so here we are   'overlooked and forgotten   'unnatural and super natural   'watching the dance from the sidelines   'at least i was surrounded by friends and family '  why won't anyone look at me   'at least i got that bit right '  you know the worst thing about being a ghost  it's lonely   you'll give anything for that     crumb of comfort   that feel of skin against skin that says it's ok  i'm here   it's a hunger   the most basic instinct   you might even drag others into this world of the dead   even if it means turning them into monsters  too   then there are the ones like george   the ones that should have died   but shattered and bloody  they walk away from the train wreck   but at what cost   they're scarred   aa aa aa aargh   transformed   they're monsters now  too    aberrations   the stuff of nightmares   the big bad wolf   so     what have we got left to look forward to  us refugees     the flotsam and jetsam of death   i was joking  put them back in the sink  i'll put them back in the sink   'maybe  if we still deserve such a thing as mercy   '  i needed to do that   '  we find each other '  hello  12 inch mess of meats  oh  thank you  great   keep the change  so  how long have you been delivering pizzas   uh   couple of months   could you ride a moped or did they teach you  they taught us   we had to drive round a car park  bet you hate pizza

surface is covered with mugs of tea and coffee   i go to make some tea and i can't   there's no mugs  no tea  it's all been made   you can't even drink it   you can't drink it  but you keep making it

be pleased for her   she can be seen by other people now   she can step out of the house  other people move in somewhere   they get damp  no  they get woodlice   why do we get caspar the friendly ghost   we've been over this   there must be something unresolved about her death   that's what's keeping her here  it's not fair     exactly  whatever happened to her  it was unfair   no  it's unfair her being here  the amount of washing up she generates     so what are you gonna do   oh  well  i'll work for an hour   then say there's a family emergency  and scoot down to the isolation room before the moon comes up  cool   i'll come and let you out in the morning   voice  'mitchell   '  jesus  mitchell  how are you supposed to find anywhere in this place   i followed the signs to intensive care

six  watching your cat have kittens   it's  it's private   well  you've seen me since i've died   i think the rules of privacy got a bit muddy   oh  come on  it's not like you can hurt me  maybe she should   this is what i mean  it's part of you   ok  erm  keep to the kitchen   stay out of its line of vision   if it sees you  i don't know what it'll do  aargh   it's coming   i think someone's finally moved into number 18   aaargh   aa aa aa aargh   aa aargh   aa aa aa aargh  aa aa aa aargh   aa aa aa aargh   george   george   he's gone   hey  hi   oh  no     where's  where's all our stuff   what did it do  we've salvaged what we can   but there's about ten bin bags of crap and wreckage  stashed in my bedroom  i'm sensing a trip to ikea   and you know my feelings about that  look  why don't you two go out   let me finish up here  it's the least i can do  owen rang   owen who  owen  your landlord   my fiancee  ex fiancee   he's coming round  in about    now   he's coming here  why  he's over from saudi and wants to meet us   well  you guys are his longest staying tenants   all the others have found it  er  strangely unwelcoming   why didn't you put him off   i tried   but she kicked me in the shin   the shin  george  sorry  can we focus   you're not going to be here when he arrives  of course   obviously i'll hide  he's not gonna see me   ok  i've written a list of questions for you to ask him   are you screwing janey harris   she always fancied owen  if she'd known when i died   she'd have been here before the ambulance crew   ah h   has my sister had a baby   cos they've been trying for ages   i blame her husband  robin  works for the post office   oh  my god  has everyone taken stupid pills  this is annie's ex    annie's ex  who buried her   she can't be here  you can't be within ten miles of here   well  i can't have him in the house and not see him   for christ's sake  we were engaged   and can you imagine  if he sees you   the effect it will have on him  the  the  the danger it'll put us all in   this isn't about our safety  you've lost your lover   and now you can't bear the thought of me seeing mine   that's    that's    how dare you    look  if she stays upstairs  what's the worst that can happen   i'll remind you of that as the crowds gather with torches and pitchforks   no  i'm sorry  we have to protect the household   you have just smashed up the household   it wasn't me     oh  that's that settled  annie   ok  ok  erm and remember     janey harris   crazy  you're all crazy    oh h h   ask about the clanky tap  no  i will   just  just just leave all of the talking to me   now  remember  we're two guys renting a house   it's  it's the most natural thing in the world   we just have to be totally and completely normal   yeah  good luck with that   hey  how you doing  good  good  i'm mitchell  nice to meet you  owen   this is george  hi  how's it going  yes   where's all the furniture  um    oh  um   we wanted a more  uh  minimalist life   it's so easy to get seduced by all the clutter and debris  of 21st century living  isn't it  isn't it   to think having this sofa or that  uh  uh  uh  chair  will bring you happiness when really  shouldn't we be striving  for something more spiritual  more    more zen   oh  i thought maybe you were going to redecorate  and didn't want to get the furniture all painty   yeah  that would have made more sense   george  why don't you go and see what that was   yes  thank you  mitchell  can i get you a drink  owen   tea  coffee  there's a couple of beers in the fridge   actually i wouldn't mind a beer  i'm still on saudi time   what are you doing  we can hear you   i just wanna to see him   look i can sneak down  i can hide  are you crazy   he will see you and    and die of shock   annie  that is not an option  most of the time it's fine   eventually the water comes through   but it's driving george nuts   ok  no worries  i'll take a look  like i said   it's such a relief having you guys here   er  it didn't work out with the last lot of people     oh  cheers  i think they heard  about what happened and let their imaginations run away with them   you do know  about my fiancee   a little  just what the estate agent said   yeah  i've hardly been back since   you can imagine  it's still kind of weird   being here   what happened  exactly   if you don't mind me asking   erm    we'd literally just moved in   we were still living out of boxes   and it was dark  i hadn't sorted out the wiring yet   and she was at the top of the stairs and     i don't know  they said she must have     fallen awkwardly or something     what was she like   annie   oh  she was kind  funny   cleverer than she thought she was     and she was mine   i believe people can leave an echo  in a place where they were   i know the tenants before us said they could detect something   maybe that's what it was   they said it was creepy  it's not  it's not creepy   it's good  it's happy   we like it   what was it  what   oh  um     it was  it was a pigeon   a pigeon  must have left a window open   well  have you got rid of it  i killed it  you  you killed it   with a shoe   you know what  i should  erm    i gotta get going   yeah  really  aw  oh    it was lovely to meet you  owen   thanks for the drink  any problems  phone me   yeah  like i said  we're really happy here   really  thank you  really   how'd you do that  stay so calm   ok  shut up  you're a spy  aren't you   you've clearly had training  because the way you held it together   it was chilling   he loved you very much  annie   the way he talked about you     you made him very happy   oh  did you ask about the tap   is this his   what   this bottle  is it his   yeah   thank you very much  you want to see it again   here we go  are you watching  are you sure you're watching   you're not watching  here it comes   thank you very much   ah  there's my friend  sorry  guys  gotta go  one more   no  no  another time  i promise   you didn't get my message   this isn't your fucking larder  herrick   this is a social call  nothing more  we're really worried about you   we're meant to keep a low profile   coming here   attacking people in their sleep   attacking people in their sleep  who is attacking people in their sleep   seth said     seth said      listen   there's something you need to know about seth   he's an idiot   but it makes you think  doesn't it   these rules about what we can and cannot do   now for instance  here's a thought   suppose the world knew of our existence   suppose they had a choice     sorry  love  do you do hot chocolate   you do  good  do you want a hot chocolate   no  i'll have one hot chocolate  please   what time did you start  uh  two   ooh  that's long shift   so who do you get in here mostly  this time of night  staff  mainly   though we get parents too  of the kids in the children's ward   you can tell 'em a mile off   they take it in turns and they come in  and they order their coffee but they don't drink it   well  i'm sure they very much appreciate what you do   actually  it's fine  well  you're very kind   take care   what was that  more tricks   no  it's  er   manners   so we declare ourselves   and what then  start a mass conversion   whoa  whoa  whoa  one step at a time     but  that is exactly the kind of left field thinking  we need right now   and those that refuse   well  as i recall  you welcomed me with open arms   god  that is terrible   taste it  to save the lives of my men   yeah  how noble of you to take on the curse of immortality  so that your friends could wither and decay  in hospitals and old people's homes   i'm kidding  just teasing you   i'm willing to bet   you offer people eternal life   not just for them but their lovers and children    and the queues would stretch a thousand miles   let's go up to the children's ward   those parents she was talking about   you think a single one of them would turn us away   you've thought about it  haven't you   they had their chance   we left them to tend this paradise  this eden  and look what they did   you know what i don't understand  this interest in me   look  if things were to change   having you by my side  like it was  back in the day  it would     people admire you   i admire you   despite your  er    your eccentricities   my eccentricities  yeah  i mean we all we all play a part   but you    it's like you like it   plus now i hear everyone tells me you're on the wagon   i wouldn't expect you to understand   good  i don't  it's mental   you're a shark  be a shark   besides  i suppose you've got some fall backs in place   fall backs  oh  just someone you've been grooming   so that eventually when you do fall off the wagon   you won't have too far to drop   oh  that's me   everything's about to change  and nothing can stop it   this is nature  it's tectonic plates shifting   and the only thing is  the only thing you and me get to choose   is which side we're on when it happens   something to ponder   listen  i'm going to that thing later   the memorial thing  for lauren   you want to come  um  i don't know     come on  it'll be nice   well  not nice so much as    horrible   i thought you were friends  not really   a bit  towards the end   george  hiya  hi   i need three pillow cases  please   mrs nixon's just vommed up her fisherman's pie   thank you for sharing  you've changed your shampoo   it's minty  normally you're vanilla y   how do you know that    er  i've just got a good sense of smell   erm  do you like it   yes  you smell like a polo   have you got a hole   i'll  uh  see you later  yeah   shit  are you interested in her  no   i don't know  why  are you   me  god  no   i mean  she's nice  but     if you're interested in her  i could     oh  come on  it's not like you get  interested in people every day  i don't want to discourage it   she won't be interested in me  i'll ask  do you want me to ask  no  no   christ  this is so playground   well  welcome to being a bloke   why are you so anxious to pair her off with me   i'm not trying to pair you off  that's    that's daft   let me talk to her  you see  i can actually talk to women  without weeping or setting fire to myself   i don't know  i don't know   let me think about it   oh  yeah   have you seen my phone   no   'tap in kitchen making very odd noises   'could you come and repair   'this afternoon good   'hope you're well   'from george '  boo   lauren   surprise   did you enjoy my memorial service   it's a shame mitchell couldn't make it   maybe he'll come to yours   aw  your face   this must be really confusing   let me explain    before i died i had this one odd last thought   and now i'm gonna make it yours   you know all the things that you were scared of as a kid   all the monsters under the bed   they're all real   ok  i'm kind of new to this   but aren't you supposed to  er  weep or scream or wee yourself   mitchell did this to you   what  you know  you know what he is   wait a sec   come here   oh  my god   a werewolf   creepy   hey  ooh  there's some bacon in the fridge at home   that goes off at midnight  guess who i just saw   er   yoko ono   no  lauren   i manage my condition  i hide in a shitty bloody cellar  or the middle of a forest  but you   you buy a bottle of wine and a packet of condoms   what is the point of us trying to build some kind of normality  when you are attacking our friends and turning them into monsters   for christ's sake   we knew her  you let me go to her bloody memorial   how the hell do you think i've survived for the last 100 years   there's no escape from it   i'm not like you  i don't have days off  this is what i am   then why are we even trying   hey  oh  shit  sorry  can i walk on that  have you just mopped there   it's fine   so do you want to come out for a drink with me   yep  i've made a decision  no more procrastination   i've been meaning to do it for ages  but i just kept putting it off   that sounded a lot funnier in the ladies   what the hell   cool  right  erm  see you later then   oh  god   owen  be not afraid   george   it's owen   george   it's owen   mitchell   the tv's on   maybe he's popped out   hello   i rang the doorbell     look  you don't have to do this  janey  you can wait in the car   it's fine  i want to  you think i should turn this off   you say something   what   did you say something   you're hearing things     you gonna look at this tap   er  yeah  it could take a while  go and wait in the car  please   and miss you doing diy   it'd be like missing an eclipse   i have no idea what i'm doing   oh  hello   what   ahhh  hello  hello  george  hi  sorry   we rang the doorbell  no one answered   no  no  no  no  no  no  no  it's  it's  it's  it's fine  it's  erm     i got your text  my text  about the tap   the tap  yeah  george  you texted me  about the tap   right  the tap  but how silly of me  telling you to come round when i wouldn't be here   sorry  i haven't even introduced you  er  this is my partner  janey   janey  harris  hi   right  hello   i'm going to have to come back later   take a look at the tank in the attic   erm  so when are you not in   i don't want to disturb you  well  it's hard to say   there's usually someone here   ok  well  i'll pop by later in the week   it was nice to meet you  yes  nice to meet you too  bye   annie   i just wanted a chance to explain   look  you don't know him  you don't know how he'd react  but i knew   i just  i knew that if  if he saw me again  he'd     but he couldn't see me  and now he's got someone else   and now she gets to kiss him  and watch him shave  and laugh  and i'm still in the clothes that i died in   i get nothing  she gets him and i get     i get you   after i got     after i lost everything  i ran away   i met mitchell and we came here and met you and     i'd just about come to terms with what'd happened to me   and then i saw her   my ex   and she'd met someone else   and it was so   savage   so i know how it feels   it feels like losing everything all over again   how did it happen   we were on holiday in scotland   the place we were staying was on the edge of this huge ravine   and one night i decided to go for a walk   i've never been so scared   this thing was     even at the time i remember looking at it and being     offended   that thing in this world  it was so  so wrong   it attacked you   this other guy  this  er    another guest  he'd tagged along   he was killed   it literally tore his throat and chest out   over there  he's there  this way now  quickly   i was only scratched  this way   i survived   like me   like you  hooray for us   why do you think owen couldn't see you   i dunno   maybe the shock of it was like     just set me back  like a relapse   there's just so much of this i don't understand   so what did you think of her then   janey  she's     orange   she works in a tanning salon   she thinks that looks classy   i think she looks like kilroy   well  you're much prettier   and much nicer   and much deader   does that look like a three or a five   a three   that's what i thought  that's becca's handwriting for you   so if she give mr davies his meds at three   then he's gonna need 'em again  hm  now   but if she give 'em to him at five   oh  he ain't gonna need 'em till ten o'clock  so ask her   she ain't answering her mobile   gone out for a drink with your mate   what mate  you know  him with the face  where   where did they go  christ knows   i would have asked but that would have looked like i gives a shit   i'm serious  if there's another man there  i can't pee   that's ridiculous   i know  at my age   ok  now you   something embarrassing   uhhhh  ok  it wasn't until six months ago that i stopped phoning  my ex every time i got drunk   oh  god  i probably shouldn't have said that   no  it's sweet  it's tenacious   yeah   sweet   me  usually with sick in my hair  going   gavi i i n    oh  erm  i meant to ask you  how's the not smoking going   oh  not great   but i'm thinking  once a smoker  always a smoker   there's no point in fighting it   so  would you like to come back to mine   my flat mate's out so we'd have the place to ourselves   erm  is that a friend of yours   well  lookee here  mind if i join you   aren't you going to introduce us  i should explain   me and mitchell dated  well  just once really   it was sort of a date   so where are we up to  with me he did this whole thing about  the ancient machinery of the world  please don't do this   at least he brought you out   we had to make do with a bottle of wine from the supermarket  and a packet of doritos at my place  i've seen you before   well  i had my photo in the paper recently   yeah  yeah   i've seen you in a photo    get up   i want to see her face when she works it out  get up   well  you seem nice   maybe afterwards we could hang out     oh  i  er  saw your furry friend   i was actually gonna feed from him  can you imagine   i'd probably have to get jabs or something   what do you want  did herrick send you   this isn't just about him  then what do you want  you left me   you brought me into this and then you left me   i woke up surrounded by strangers   it should have been you there  ever since then they've just passed  me round  i'm like this orphan   i'm sorry     come away with me  there's places we can go   where we can be safe from them   they're not some dopey abusive boyfriend   you think anywhere's safe from them   they stay away from the smaller towns  anywhere that's exposed   wait    oh  my god  you actually think i want saving   we can save each other  this is what i'm trying     we can save each other  ok   you don't get it  do you   i want to kill  i want to feel their blood dripping down my chin   i want to see their faces when they realise   i wanna kill my parents  my lovers  i want them to know   herrick's talking about offering it first   christ  let's just take it  take their world   tear their children to shreds   thank you  what for   you can't do this  mitchell  you can't
