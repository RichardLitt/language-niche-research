i think we should call things off  what do you mean   do you know where he's gone  back to his wife   he's got kids  nick  what   you've been had   i want the flat  what    no more demands on me after this  whatever   veronica  veronica hastings   she disappeared and she was only six  and then she turned up dead   that's why i joined the police  to find out why no one was ever caught   is that what you wanted to ask me  if we could re open it   yeah  for my mother   and veronica  well  leave it with me   it's the only way   you can't make a mortgaged property into a third party   so it'll be a joint mortgage   i take care of the monthly payments but it's your name on the policy   does that make sense   yes   so you're happy   i wouldn't go that far   as regards this   there's something else that you may or may not wanna know   what   i'm pregnant   i don't believe you   nine weeks     well  you can't be pregnant  you're on the pill   is it mine  it's you that puts it about  pal  not me   what do you want  what do you want me to do   do we need to pay for a clinic   you're assuming it's a termination   well  you can't want a baby   why not  am i not the type   you're ambitious  you've got a career   and thought i was in a relationship with a responsible adult until recently   you planned it  no  i       as it happens  i didn't   not got much choice  have i   it won't be you haemorrhaging down the toilet  feeling like a murdering bastard  that'll be me   sorry  is that a bit graphic for you   anyway  thanks for that  nick   along with all the other pleasant memories    right  lads  story so far   where's janet and   rachel   delivering the death message   i squared it with west yorkshire cos the body's with us   susan metcalfe  43   wife  mother  primary school teacher   living over the border in riponden  west yorkshire   battered senseless  she was found in the boot of her own car  in a lay by off saddleworth moor   courting couple out on a lake  one saw blood on the boot  called three nines   ambulance arrived just after five  she's still breathing   indications suggests she's likely to prove fatal   she dies 6 17 this morning at the royal oldham   they said it looked like somebody had tried to eviscerate her   do what  pull her insides out   massive internal injuries   she'd been raped every which way from christmas   are you listening  hmm   susan had been to the theatre in oldham with her friend  carol manning   susan rang carol at 11pm  as she can't work out where she's parked her car  not being familiar with the town   says she's near cam cabs on richworth road   carol directs susan back to buick road   susan had remembered the name of the street she'd parked in   that's the last anyone heard from her  family report her missing in the early hours   night crew talk to carol  the friend   they're onto the cctv outside the taxi office   ok  here's the bit   which shows her being followed by some lad  man  boy  bloke   who'd just left the taxi place   he follows her  look at him   heat seeking missile   he follows her towards buick road   we've got them on three separate cameras  still behind our victim   six minutes later  her vehicle seen driving away from buick road   but those are not her hands on that steering wheel   look at that watch   so the chances are  she's already in the boot by that stage   the good news is  we think we know roughly where he lives   taxi operator says he asked for a cab to the walden estate   there's none available   so he comes out and that's where he bumps into her   jangling her car keys looking lost   are you all right   just pull in   so lots of nice fast track actions waiting for you on this one   andy's coordinating the house to house   something tells me this isn't this little weirdo's first outing   but let's make it his last  finish your brews  get your gear and go   i want us giving this boy an early morning knock     late night   pregnant   i've a     i'm having an abortion on wednesday   does gill know   no  i'm not gonna get grounded   i booked the day off but i've not said why     why go for a scan if you're having an abortion   i don't know   just did  wanted to see what it looked like   mr metcalfe   i'm dc scott  manchester metropolitan police   you know something  this is dc bailey   may we come inside  have you found her   is this adam   i'm janet  this is rachel   we're police officers   is there somewhere we can sit down  mr metcalfe   melissa  i'm janet  this is rachel  we're police officers   oh  jesus  oh  jesus  no   want to sit down  love   a woman's been found matching your wife's description   she was found in your wife's car   she was taken by ambulance to the royal oldham at 6 15 this morning  but i'm very sorry to have to tell you that she died shortly after   matching her description   you mean  it might not be her   well  we can't confirm that  until she's been identified by someone who knows her   but based on the description you gave the officer last night  and given the fact she was in your wife's car   we think it very likely it is your wife   sorry  did you say she's dead   yes   did she      was it a      did she come off the road  then  was it an accident   no   there are indications that she'd been assaulted   who by   how   why   i won't have the answer to all your questions just now  mr metcalfe   i've only got a limited amount of information myself   but we think we've found cctv footage of susan last night  after you reported her missing   and it does appear that she was being followed by a man   what man   we will find him   and when we do  believe you me   what did he do to her   let's just be sure it's your wife we're talking about before    what did he do to her   can you bear with me  adam   because i don't know very much more myself at the moment   she wasn't interfered with  though  or anything  was she   there are indications that it may have been a sexual assault  yes

she's said nothing   but she can't count chickens until we get the blood results on that watch   she hates me  are you sure you're not letting your hormones      she's letting you interview him  i arrested him   so  would she let kevin loose on this one if he'd arrested him   what were you laughing at just then  boss  you   have you not finished that interview prep   you'll be out of time before you've asked him a question   i'm not gonna get anywhere near him before tomorrow with his solicitor poking about     will you have a drink  no  thank you  sir   we picked one up first thing this morning  i've been on the go since six so      family to get home to  eh   ok  well  i'll give you what i've got  do you want to come through   i made copies of everything connected to the case

in a minute   what's it like   well       it's   painful   'and you can't imagine how you're ever gonna come out the other side  without being ripped asunder '  but   you do  and       it's brilliant and beautiful   even when you've got your legs up in stirrups  and 3 000 stitches up your     but that's the easy bit   it's the next five  ten  15 years that do your nut in      rachel   i can't do this   what can't you do   it's a baby  you know   it's flesh and blood and       a brain and   a smile     do you want me to come over   i'd rather be here  honestly   this is why i don't want any fuss made about this bloody anniversary   what  what is  ade   ah  you knew he was a geography teacher when you married him   i'd rather just ignore it completely  than go through the misery of watching him having to make an effort   i get home  and instantly i'm on nursing duty   lady gaga's farting about with period pains and he's just sat in front of the telly   you wouldn't be without yours  though  would you   even when they are driving you up the wall   rache  i can't tell you what to do   whatever you choose  you'll still torture yourself after it was wrong   you've been dumped on from a great height by a man who needs his head examined   nobody envies you the position you're in   and nobody is gonna judge you for it after   what would you do if you were me   i'd get rid of it   looks like you're right  gill   not this little weirdo's first outing   what have we got   they found a pair of jeans and a shirt stuffed behind the fireplace   behind the brickwork  covered in blood   but it's not from yesterday  it's black   how long have they lived at that address    right  bring it in  let's have a look at it   how was tom walters   oh  good  useful  thank you  great   i'll ring ade  tell him to get his arse into gear and organise you a party   gill   don't     did you want to see me   how's it going   no comment   'how would you respond if i told you that it's susan metcalfe's blood on your rolex ' 'no comment '  'and on your nike's ' 'no comment '  'and your sperm all over what's left of her ' 'no comment '  i've finished  so if you want to get on to the cps  we can charge the little freak   look what father christmas left behind the fireplace   i wanna show you a photograph  ok  luke   for the benefit of the tape  i'm showing luke  photograph exhibit reference pt7   could you tell me who those people are in the picture   that's me  my mum and my auntie and my sister   and when was that taken  do you remember   christmas   this last christmas   no   the one before   er   or the one before that   could you describe to me what you're wearing in the photograph   a paper hat   what else   jeans       shirt  what colour is that shirt   could you describe it to me   it's green       white       tartan   have you still got it   no  what happened to it   my mum threw it away  why   got   got dirty   could she not wash it   no  i meant dirt   dirty with oil   i want you to look at another photograph for me now  ok   for the benefit of the tape  i'm showing luke two photographs   exhibit references df2 and df3   are you ok  luke   yeah   you seem a bit upset   no   i'm just     it's everything  you know   would you like some water   no   ok   could you tell me what's in this photograph here   shirt   could you describe it to me   it's  like       it's  like  m m mucky   when your shirt was stained with oil  is this what it looked like   that isn't my shirt   that's not oil  in fact  luke   that's actually blood   could you describe the pattern on that shirt to me   that isn't my shirt  what colour is it   it's not my shirt   how would you describe it   would you agree that it's exactly the same sort of shirt  that you're wearing in that photo   would it surprise you  luke  if i told you  that we found that shirt in your house when we searched it yesterday   do you think  given that we found it in your house   it's more than likely that it is your shirt   the one you're wearing in that photo at christmas   no   it's a bit of coincidence  wouldn't you say   to find a shirt  exactly the same pattern and design    it can't be  i told you  it got thrown away  she     she didn't  did she  who   who  luke   she said she'd burnt it   who   my mother   mum   hello  mrs farrell   we need to talk to you about something that's come up during the search   what   would you mind coming down to the police station with us   mrs farrell   i need to get dressed  of course   has something happened   just a bit of a development   is your auntie in  yasmin   half past six she gets in from work   i'll  er    i'll just see if your mum's ok   mrs farrell   have you got kids   two  girls   girls are easy   do you want to get dressed  mrs farrell   break your heart  do all sorts   still do what you can  though  don't you  for 'em   within reason   i nearly yesterday morning said something but     what about   what happened   when   you've found them clothes  haven't you   he promised me it wouldn't happen again   what wouldn't happen again   you know   are you telling me that you're aware luke might have done something like this before  mrs farrell   he didn't know why he'd done it   any more than anybody else would have done   he were terrified  didn't know what to do with himself   i was there when he       came home   covered in blood  shitting himself   do you know what it was that he'd done before   you might as well tell me because we're analysing that blood  and as soon as there's a match on our database     margaret and barry whelan     susan farrell  i'm arresting you on suspicion of assisting an offender  and perverting the course of justice     he said he'd bumped into somebody on the way home   they'd seen him covered in blood   i don't think they did   or they'd have said  i was terrified   thought there'd be police banging on t'door any second   helicopters  all hell breaking loose   i said to him  'get up them stairs  get in that shower  and i'll deal with t'clothes '  just   wanted shot of 'em  out of sight   and i would have burnt them but   we had nowhere   i didn't want to touch 'em ever again once they were in there   and i would have told somebody    did he tell you what he'd done   but i didn't realise the extent of it till it was in the papers   how did he tell you  what did he say   that he'd killed someone  someone   two   peo   people   but you didn't realise the extent of it   can you tell me exactly what you mean by that  mrs farrell   margaret and barry whelan   don't tell me you've never heard of 'em   about 18 months ago  brother and sister in their fifties   lived in a semi up crompton  he's got down's syndrome   oh  god  that was awful   tied her up  raped her  made him watch   oh  shut up  makes even me feel sick   i don't know how you sit in the same room as him   why do they do it   sexual curiosity in his case   oh  we're all curious at that age but     yes  alison  he's sick  he's nuts   he's got a screw loose  he's a fruit loop   but she hasn't got a screw loose  his mother  that bitch   what'll happen to her   she'll go down big time  assisting an offender on that scale  ten years   but it could happen to anyone  couldn't it  finding out your kid's peculiar   wouldn't keep quiet about it  though  would ya   a normal person at the very least would get drunk and blurt it out   you don't know what you'd do when it's your own kid   anyway  come on  we're gonna be late for the clinic   boss is buzzing   force command thought they'd never solve the whelan murder  so she's flavour of the month  she   we  has it not occurred to her to give rache a pat on the back   has she not  perhaps you could suggest it   do you fancy going for a drink   after work  over t'road   i mean with the lads  and gill if she's not too    i'd love to  andy  but   i can't  i'm meeting someone   who   a friend   well  bring 'em  him  her   it's not that sort of friend   it's someone i was at school with  erm     well  i can't explain  well  i can explain but       it's complicated     tom walters reckons that whoever killed veronica  has gone on and committed other murders   and he believes that he's still alive  because his latest one   if his theory stands up    was committed less than two years ago in bexhill   and he thinks it was someone who knew veronica   that it wasn't just a random attack  she was targeted   i don't know which question to ask first   bexhill  that's     on the south coast  yeah   so our guy obviously learnt very early on  that there are 43 police forces in england and wales   and unlike today  none of them spoke to each other   so you could do one in oldham  and if your next one was in cornwall   nobody was necessarily making any connections   hang on  this one in bexhill two years ago   surely that's still under investigation   oh  yeah  it will be   so why hasn't this tom talked to them  then   he has   he wrote to them  he rang up  but       he's eighty  he's a retired policeman with a   problem   and he's obsessed with the one that got away   they probably found someone nice to talk to him on the telephone  and then wrote him off as a crank   but you think he's onto something   pelling factors   such as   well  i've never dealt with a serial killer before   but   they leave certain trademarks   some they're aware of  others they're not   of the six murders that he's identified   there are similar trademarks  plus       there's a physical similarity to veronica   same colour hair  slim build   and they've all occurred approximately  give or take   every five years since veronica died   so why isn't anybody onto it  then   hello   no  i meant officially   cold case had it on their list   look  what i'm gonna do is read everything and collate it   and then hand it over to the serious crime analysis section   they've got a national database   so any similarities with other crimes will be highlighted   so   there is hope that we can get a bit closer to this fella   aren't you having a day off   that   was yesterday   oh  ok   can i just      i'm pregnant  i'm having a baby   so obviously you need to know that   have you got a due date   august 4th   slap bang in the middle of the annual leave season   great  rachel  well timed   it wasn't planned  why doesn't that surprise me   when i'm back  i want to get on with my sergeant exams     melissa     i can't get hold of our flo and you said i could ring you if i needed   yeah  what's up  love  our adam   he's been up all night off his head drinking and he's not used to it   'and i don't know where my dad is   adam said he was gonna go and sort that family out  and he's been gone nearly four hours '  and he won't answer his phone   and he's been messing about with a can of petrol   all right  melissa  listen to me   i'm gonna ring you back in ten minutes  i'll find him   i've a metcalfe with a can of petrol   dc bailey  mit  we've got a lad in custody for that murder on saddleworth moor on friday night   the victim's son is drunk and he's gone off on one   he might cause damage to the suspect's home    you're going nowhere  girl  you're pregnant   you'll sit down in that office and stay there  sorry   yeah     yep  thanks   he's downstairs  he's put a petrol bomb through the sitting room window   where was yasmin  the girl   i assumed she's round at the auntie's house  she's only 15   dci murray  mit  i need to speak to the person who just spoke to my dc    which one do you want  her or him   her     don't do that   i want my mum   adam  we're moving you   we're taking you to another police station   why   come on  love   mrs farrell  i've got some difficult news for you   your house has been the subject of an arson attack   a young female  who we believe to be your daughter yasmin   was asleep in bed upstairs   she was taken by ambulance to the royal oldham at 7 30 this morning  but died shortly after arriving at a e   you're lying   can you hear that young lad sobbing his heart out   he's the one that did it   he petrol bombed your house and he killed your daughter   my colleague's just gone in there to arrest him   she really doesn't want to  do you know why   because he's the son of the woman that luke raped and mutilated   and left to bleed to death in her car  in the freezing cold at four in the morning in the middle of nowhere   so  not to put too fine a point on it   if you hadn't hidden those clothes   if you'd done what anyone in their right mind would have done   your daughter  or what's left of her   would not now be in a body bag in a fridge down at the mortuary   so you think about that       so  come on   what  i don't know why   just  i got to the doors of the clinic  i turned round and came home   i think it was mainly cos i couldn't stand to spend a whole day with our alison   i've told godzilla and she said  'ooh  rachel  i'm delighted for ya  how lovely '  she did not  no  did she bollocks   she said  'ooh  august  well timed  knobhead    she's a bitch  i'm sick of her  she's a nasty  miserable old    oh  hi  boss
