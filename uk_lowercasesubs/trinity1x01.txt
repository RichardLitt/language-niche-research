ask     biology a level  paper 2  question  yeah  what did you put   hey  i hear there's a party tonight   i doubt it  you do know that trinity doesn't have a freshers' week   they expect us to study  to study   so there's no parties   well  unless you mean the feast of fools   the dandelion club party   upper class twits   doubtless all the girls will end up taking their clothes off  and offering themselves to the first available guy     right   just out of interest  how would i   or anyone else     get to this party   you're not thinking of going  are you   hey  look  you could come with me   i really don't think so   i saw her first  hands off   well  this has been     the biscuits were amazing   really good biscuits   i guess i'll see you   around   age shall not wither her  nor custom stale her infinite variety   thank you  edmund   this is it  then   i'm very proud of you  you know   you're going to do wonderfully here   i hope so   thank you for everything  my pleasure     warden   knocked at my door  to interview for doctorate   slip of a thing  she was   short hair  rather reminiscent of an eight year old boy   she stands before you now  as diminutive as ever   but with a string of academic posts and several books behind her   gentlemen  marjorie  this is an ambitious woman   a forward thinking woman   a woman i know who clearly relishes the challenge  of dragging our weary old institution  into the so called modern world   i give you your new warden  dr angela donne   welcome back to bridgeford   whoa   almost dropped it then   i'll go  oh  bugger  it's the wrong box   it's the wrong box   all my old toys  they were meant to be going to africa   this was meant to be full of clothes   oh  my god  what were you thinking  maddy   you idiot   maddy  right  yeah   don't you think the people in africa will probably prefer the clothes   yeah  yeah  they will  won't they   i mean what were they going to do with a blinking my little pony   eat it    on the other hand  they are quite hungry  aren't they   the africans   yeah  really old ones   i guess i'll be seeing you around  then  yeah   sorry  what's your name  theo   thank you  bye   fit   i'm ready for my bedder now  thank you  mr dobkin   where's ingrid   oh  this is ridiculous   oh  excuse me  i was     oh   i can't get the key to er     damn   where's my bedder  she should be in your room   that ogre   i usually have a swedish bedder  where is she   i imagine she's back in gothenburg   recovering from the abortion that we paid for   bingo   maybe this term   you could keep your sperm in the bag   i'd be ever so grateful   i want a new bedder  now   not possible  auburn hair please  since it's michaelmas   i always find redheads very christmassy  don't you   dorian  you should know there have been some changes round here   we have a new warden   a modernist  who leans more than somewhat to the left   so get rid of him  it's a her  actually   a woman warden   does daddy know about this    see yous later  see yous later   bye  bye   i like your vans  i like yours   awesome  thanks   do you like donnie darko   the film movie  aye   do you want to come to my room and get mashed   oh  aye  like   awesome   i've taught at bridgeford university for over 30 years   the seventies were the worst   hippies and lesbians pounding at the gates  demanding change   'this is the 20th century ' they would say   do you know what you'd do in that situation  nothing   young tick   you give them something   something you can bear  and they can call a victory   back then  we let women in  masterstroke   so when the education minister came to me last may  and said 'this is 21st century ' i knew what had to be done   this warden's a publicity stunt   well  she     she was one of my phd students   hard working  pretty   ish  an idealist   the kind of fluff they like to see  well  stiff upper lip   at least i have a party to look forward to  yes  that reminds me     you are not touching the feast of fools   not me  her   she can't  it's important to college morale   picking two students from lower class families  to be your jesters for the year  yes  what's the problem   dorian  it's not       politic   honestly  what is happening to this place   now look    who's that   theo mackenzie  i interviewed him   surprisingly promising   this is the finest academic institution in the country   i go away for one summer  and you've turned it into a basketball team   i'm going back to bed  dorian     there's a girl on your corridor  charlotte arc   i want you to keep an eye on her   is she pretty  she's a christian   hmm  challenge   why  out of interest  do you think she's a troublemaker   i knew her father   so   give me three guesses   missing your parents   hey  hey     my dad died recently   i am so terribly sorry   where was his estate  you are landed  aren't you   if you count a terraced house in leeds as landed   my mistake  i presumed you were of good breeding   after all  you're so frightfully pretty  those cheekbones   like eleanor of aquitaine   why don't you have two tickets for a little party i'm having tonight   a lovely thing like you would fit right in   lunch soon  shower for me   yes   i was just wanted to say that what you said back there  about breeding and me being pretty  well  i think     look  i believe in meritocracy  ok   so breeding doesn't mean you're pretty   and even if it did   that was wrong   hey  i'm sorry   is that all   erm    yes  thank you   very well  then   dr cooper  unusual to see you here   that's just what i was going to say  he's so rarely out of his lab these days   he takes his work seriously  don't you  linus   the light came on  midnight   mm  is there a problem   i'm not sure i'm going to have enough time   of course you will  of course you will   angela  gabriel   gabriel lloyd   did you get taller  probably just       standing up straighter  you haven't changed   no  no  not at all   except your hair's longer  obviously   a few less freckles dappling your nose   i have to apologise  i was supposed to come to your introductory speech   and i wanted to come but i didn't   and then i sat there at my desk and i thought this is silly   i have to clear the air sooner or later   so i'm sorry for what i said last time we met   it was 20 years ago   you remember  i told you i loved you   good luck  thank you   yes  well  i just want you to know     a lot's changed here  a lot  i've changed   lloyd  get into line  sorry   maybe we could have a coffee sometime  catch up   lloyd   so question 41  angus fergus     what are your major ambitions here at trinity   i suppose  if i were honest  raj puri       my major ambition would be to       lose my virginity  snap   i mean  at school  i had a lot of offers    a great number of offers  but     i just didn't seem to get round to it   snap  man  i mean  me too  you know  it's just like     sex is like  so manic  isn't it   it's like you get one chance and you have to  like  grab it then and there   you know  like  honestly  it's not chilled  it's not cool   sex is uncool  it is way uncool   snap  man   still  i   i guess we should have some   aye  yeah   aye   yeah   this lunch thing's soon  isn't it   fear not my friend   if there's one defining characteristic of raj puri   me    it's that i never lose track of time   raj puri   raj puri   madeleine talbot   charlotte     charlotte arc   welcome to trinity  charlotte   is that an engagement ring   gethin   that's my boyfriend    he said there'd probably be loads of chances  for me to have meaningless sex at university   and he didn't want me doing that   so we   we got engaged   that's a bit casual  isn't it   yeah  it's just a light hearted engagement  really   it's not like we're going to and get married or anything   further out  sir  oh  yeah  thanks   further still   right  thanks   and that's the lady's glass  sorry   and you're not supposed to drink before grace   cheers  mate   what is their problem  they are picky   but if you read the freshers' brochure  it's     stand for grace   alpha row  could you begin  please   bendedia  domine     nos et haec tua dona     qua de tua largitate sumus sumpturi     charlotte     don't tell me you didn't learn the grace   ok  let's be clear here  i didn't read the stupid freshers' leaflet   i didn't know this was going to be so     per christum dominum nostrum     mensa coelesti     oh  shit  he doesn't know it   participes faciat nos  one more time   participes faciat nos   parsnips   satcha   toast   sorry  yeah  sorry about that   go on  say something  please   rex aeternae gloriae   watch it  sorry  sorry  mate   hey  you're in that marigold club   dandelion club   yeah  that's the one  i'm its president   oh  nice one  hey  i hear you're having a party tonight   that's right   finally  thank god  someone round here doing something normal   listen  mate  i was thinking i could come along   you have to be a member of the dandelion club if you want to come to the party   it's something of a commitment  well  i'm a committed kind of bloke   good  good  ok  well     we are a student society wholly devoted to the pursuit of pleasure   when you're a dandelion  you're not expected to work   you are  however  expected to drink an awful lot  and have sex with the most beautiful women   are you the kind of guy who could handle that  yeah  i reckon so   so how do i join   you can't  because your parents are poor   warden  warden   i'm dorian  president of the dandelion club   if it's about the feast of fools  i'm sorry but there's no arguing the matter   it's a college tradition  perhaps you're not aware    i was here 20 years ago  i remember the dandelion club   dorian  not troubling the warden  are you   i was just explaining my decision to cancel the feast of fools   quite right  the college has to move with the times  does it   forcing two students to be your jesters for the year against their will   my dear boy  it smacks of slavery  quite   so  dorian  shall we let that be the last word   of course  if a couple of students were to volunteer  then      who would volunteer  i admit it's unlikely   but  purely hypothetically  if they did   then the college would have to respect their decision   what's your position on this matter  warden   well  if they were to volunteer  there'd be nothing i could do   find your fools and get on with it  just make sure they agree to the job   no need to thank me  thank you   where on earth am i going to find two people stupid enough to agree to being my slaves   excuse me     is this where we meet for lunch   cancel that last complaint   warden     i i'm a first year  charlotte arc   charlotte  how can i help you   i think you might have known my father  oh   i've got this photo of him from back then and you're in it   i'm sure that's you   well  that's certainly seems to be me   what did you say your father's name   richard arc  richard arc   yes  he was in my doctorate group but     we didn't know each other very well  but     i think i look a little drunk in that picture  it's amazing the friends you make   look  my dad left trinity very suddenly   i was just hoping maybe you remembered something   charlotte  i think this is something you should take up with your father   i would do  i can't now   he's dead  he's dead   how  when   about two weeks ago   well  i'm   i'm sorry   as i said  i didn't really know your father very well   could you     i'm really very busy   thought we could walk down to our first tutorial together  i'm leaving   what  why   well  let me see  maybe it's the weird people   or the strange cutlery  or the fact i got laughed at by the entire college   i just get the impression this place isn't really for me   it's trinity  everyone finds it a bit strange   charlotte  this place is fucking mental  how can you be so blase   you got into trinity  yeah  and five other places   it's just a university  charlotte  no  it's the best university   well  not for me   you know  you're pretty see through   you make out that this is all because you're so cool and normal   but you know what's really going on  you're scared   so what if i am  it's easy for you   you've probably wanted to come here since you were five  you fit in   i don't feel like i fit in  trust me  you do   well  my dad didn't  he was here for ten years   he was brilliant  my mum said  and then suddenly he left   because something happened to him here   he'd never even talk about it  he never explained   he was just   sad   he was always sad     and now he's dead   so don't pretend that this is easier for me than you   because this place freaks me out   and i reckon i've got better reasons than you   right  i'm going to my tutorial now   maybe i'll see you there  look     'we agree to do the dandelion club's bidding in all things   regardless of embarrassment to ourselves or those near to us  for the term of one year '  are there going to be girls at this party   oh  yes   what do we have to do again   just be yourselves  if you could just sign it     in your own blood   just kidding   red ink will do nicely   excuse me  can i give my key back   this way  young sir   something not to your liking   seriously  mate  i just want to give my key back   leaving us already  theo   five hours at trinity   something to tell your kids about  what   i thought you'd last longer  that's all   yeah  well  no offence  but this place     what's wrong with it  too many people like me   you know the first lord gaudain was a country squire   not that much better than a peasant   he invented a new way of manufacturing sword handles   great  it made him hundreds of thousands of pounds   billions in today's money   i don't think there's been a member of my family  who hasn't been to this university since   yeah  heart warming  make a good christmas film   there are two kinds of people who matter  theo   those who have it and those who earn it   i have it  you have to earn it   your bags are being delivered to your room as we speak  miss gaudain   thanks  pete   nice meeting you   right  i'm dr maltravers   i have been a fellow of this college for over 30 years   and my research has resulted in the development of dioxypeptisol    the miracle cancer drug you may have read about   miss arc  isn't it   is that the dioxypeptisol originally thought to be a fix for incipient glaucoma   there were some initial problems identifying its precise benefit   the enquiry said that official approval had been rushed through    funny that i should see the day that my ethics  should be called into question by the daughter of richard arc   this term     sorry i'm late  hm   well  come in  mr mackenzie  close the door  please   as i was saying  this term  it is anatomy   and here at trinity's very own mortuary   you will each be dissecting your own corpse   the first tutorial is tomorrow morning   which means one of you must work overnight in the labs  preparing a presentation on the topic  'the mechanics of the arm'   miss arc  you seem a keen student   yes  good   well  i look forward to your presentation tomorrow morning at  excuse me  mr mackenzie   see you all then   you're going to be up all night   yeah  i'm going to be slaving away here  while you're living it up at the dandelion club party   what  it's not really my thing anyway   take maddy   asexual mitosis   biology a level  question number 13  oh  i didn't think of that   thank you  you're welcome   and representing the comprehensive school system   here's maddy talbot and theo mackenzie   oh  theo  everybody's so clever and beautiful and posh   oh  theo  everybody's so clever and

mads   ah  peasants   well  come in  wipe your filthy boots   what's in the box   you know  angus  this is going to be really good for us   you think  no doubt   see  the first step to sex is getting girls to notice you   after tonight  every girl in college is gonna know exactly who we are   no doubt  no doubt   nooooo doubt   no doubt  noooo doubt   what's the matter  coz  you don't think i'm being unseemly   listen  i'm about to make a speech   then we could finish what we started earlier   i don't know what you're talking about   you left me gagging   aw  bless  dorian  it was only natural we should want to do it once   all that horseplay in the stables and games of twister at christmas   who wouldn't feel a bit incestuous   but it was just a silly act of rebellion  i'm over it now   it was just this morning  i'm over it now   if i could just have people's attention  please  whoo   ok  well  this will be new to some of you   but one thing that the feast of fools has got to have is   fools     and  due to a few extra restrictions   it's been a hard job finding them this year   but i've done my best and i think i can safely say  i've come up with a couple of absolute stars   i give you   jester primus   mr angus fergus  and jester secundus   mr raj puri   rules of the game   the first fool to hold the golden ball aloft is the winner   on my whistle   just as we discussed  chaps  show these girls what you're made of     i like the way you move  a grand on the brown one   angie     got your message  i didn't think you were going to get in touch so soon   did you know richard was dead   did you know he was dead   i did   did you go to his funeral   no   why didn't you call me   i had to find out from his daughter   well  you haven't exactly kept in touch   i'm sorry  i didn't mean to sound curt   i always thought i'd see him again   really   richard was pretty determined not to see anyone   i thought about him every day  gabriel   every day   i'm sorry  angie  i can't   i can't weep for richard arc     the killers  somebody told me  do you not approve  well  you know  each to their own   are you aware of the fact that i am  well  that's not that close  is it   well  that's not the point  what is the point   the point is   have you ever come on a member of the royal family   hey  hey  charlotte   hey  hey  hey   hey     i didn't see you at the

breathe   do you sometimes think that you can see him   all the time   only i had this terrible feeling after he died   something was wrong   and i think i so wanted to talk to him that i must have imagined     and it was a hallucination    hey  come here   wedgey  wedgey  wedgey   hail the fools  hail the fools   no  stop  stop  please   it's my first time   what  you're a virgin   yeah
