stellar    you know mummy always tells the truth   of course  we have no secrets   because i want you to grow up to be brave little soldiers  i'm going to be honest with you  and tell you that   that last night   mummy almost ran out of extra virgin olive oil   darling  tell all   it was horrific  we were having guests for supper   i opened the cupboard and i was down to the last four bottles     mummy  you're shaking    i just could not cope   the reality is so different to anything you can imagine   it just completely floored me     we had no idea    are you ok talking about this   oh  yes  i'm fine  darling  really  i'm fine  i got through it  i had to get through it   i had bruschetta in the aga  olives marinading in the larder  sea bass on the griddle     i needed another litre for drizzling alone    what did you do   i knew i had to get help   and somewhere in the chaos and the despair  i     i suddenly felt this surge of strength and calm rise within me     how amazing    it was  actually   i had the presence of mind to phone daddy  and thank god i did  he was fantastic   he said  ''i can buy some from the shop on my way home '' and he did     did he really    he did  yeah  he absolutely did   just like that  he came in like a knight in shining armour and saved my life   ''cometh the hour  cometh the man ''  he was fantastic  i shudder to think what i'd have done without him   what if he'd been driving through a tunnel and lost his signal     you'd have had to drive to the shops yourselt    shh  come on  don't let's upset ourselves   gosh  it really does put everything into perspective  doesn't it        agh     ahem    agh   for goodness' sake        agh   michael  honestly   i thought we moved to the country for a bit of peace and quiet     what are you thinking  ma'am    i'm thinking  ''how about this ''  suppose  just for the sake of argument  that the bullet didn't enter the body   but it did  ma'am  he's dead  and it's because of the bullet going straight through his heart   i know that  but for the sake of argument  let's say the bullet did not enter the body     that would mean stevens was still alive    exactly   if there was no bullet  stevens would still be very much alive   but he's not  ma'am  he's dead   i know that  whittaker  but just suppose there was no bullet  what would that mean   well  it would mean that stevens would still be alive  and we wouldn't be here investigating his murder   exactly   i'm not sure where you're going with this  ma'am     shoot me with the murder weapon  whittaker    what   take this and shoot me in the heart     um      just do it  it'll be perfectly ok   i just need to be certain that a bullet in the heart is enough to kill someone   i think    i'm sure it will kill you  ma'am     just squeeze the trigger    i really don't want to kill you  ma'am   how do you know you'll kill me   this is a  44 magnum  and i'm standing a foot away from you   oh  whittaker  whittaker  just when

green light  but after that  he won't take no for an answer   he's got big hands  you know what i'm saying   i hear it's the busiest a   e in the region  i'd like a bit of experience there   oh

haven't we all  though   just 'cause you're on a diet doesn't mean you can't dribble over the menu  does it   actually  i should warn you  erm   there's been a few problems on queen elizabeth ward

on channel 4 he likes   it certainly puts the lead in his pencil  know what i mean   bernie  i don't think you realise how serious this matter is     it sounds as though you're encouraging him    he doesn't need any encouragement   he's like a puppy in a sausage factory   fair play to him  it's not the biggest i've seen on the ward   but you know what they say   if it's more than a mouthful  it's a waste   since i started here on monday  i have tried not to listen to the rumours about you   but it seems everything they say is true   oh  thanks  carole  that's really sweet     that wasn't a

      get on that chair  you no good noncepot    you said it was too dangerous   don't be such a fucking old mary anne   hic  agh   hic  agh   hic  agh    elaine figgis is 34 and lives in york  she's travelled over 4 000 miles to dallas  texas  to marry a man she's never met   jeremiah wainwright iii is a convicted murderer and notorious cannibal   he is currently on death row awaiting execution   it's strange how fate can bring two people together   i was surfing on the internet   that just means looking    and i typed in ''midsomer murders'' and up came ''midsummer murderer''   i thought  ''what's that '' i read his little ad and dropped him a line   and here we are   i had no idea that in less than two years we'd go from simple pen pals to husband and wife   it's funny  isn't it   i was only after a signed picture of john nettles    how was the journey   well  the taxi driver turned up but wouldn't let me in his cab   he'd read about me in the local paper   he's entitled to his opinion  but it's not very nice being pushed out of a car  and being called a nutter on the happiest day of your life   i missed the direct flight  so it was 19 hours by greyhound bus from atlanta to georgia   but i did sit next to a very nice man from louisiana called buck   he gave me his number  but i shan't be ringing him  of course     how did you feel when you arrived in texas    it was very emotional  actually   i felt as if i'd come home  which is odd because i was actually born in twickenham   mind you  texas  twickenham  it's the same initial   ''t''   i hadn't thought of that before   i suppose it was the realisation that i was walking on the same ground as my beloved   not literally  obviously  he's strapped to a board most of the day   but  you know  breathing in the same air   it's a once in a lifetime feeling   is that a wedding present   yeah   it's just a little love token   a last minute whizz around duty free if truth be told   i thought this might be fun   and then i thought  no  get him something he'd really like   so i got him that   he's a slave to shortbread   what do your friends think of this   oh  you can imagine what they say  ''you're doing the wrong thing  it'll never work   ''it's a ridiculous idea  you're mad ''  but that's always going to be the case when a woman marries someone considerably younger     you think that's their concern    they're not concerned at all   to be honest  it's just jealousy  that's all it is     could it be         i'm falling in love with you  baby     sorry  me and my friend jenny used to do that all the time  go on     oh   all right  that'll be me  then   good luck   i've had more than my fair share of luck   down to me now         was everything all right    yeah   all done and dusted   is that it   yeah  i knew it was going to be a short service because     well  he's a big lad and it's difficult to gauge the amount of sedative to give him   they don't want to kill him  nor do they want him lashing out with all the excitement   so it was a quick ''i do''   and that was it  really   i can't stand it when weddings drag on  though  can you     will you see jerry later today    no   he hasn't got another visiting order now for four weeks   so it's back to good old blighty   i might ask the pilot if he could tie some tin cans round the back of the plane   no  actually  that would be dangerous   i think we should go   shall we     no  i think we should go   he comes over  and i'm thinking ''oh  my god '' and he's like ''hi '' and i'm like ''hi ''  he's like ''are you alone '' and i'm like ''yes ''  he's like ''i don't believe you '' and i'm like ''come on ''  he's like ''i'm serious '' and i'm like ''cut it out  can we stop ''  he's like ''i saw you come in  can i get you a drink ''  i'm like ''that'd be great  i'll have a soda '' and he's like ''is that all ''  i'm like ''what do you mean '' and he's like ''on its own ''  he's like ''don't you drink '' and i'm like ''it's none of your business ''  he's like ''i'm only asking  calm down '' i'm like ''i'm sorry ''  he's like ''don't be  back off '' and i'm like ''fuck you ''    i once met a man with a sense of adventure    he was dressed to thrill wherever he went    he said  ''let's make love on a mountain top    ''under the stars on a big  hard rock''      i said  ''in these shoes    agh     ''i don't think soi''    ooh  i've won another bag   downloaded from
