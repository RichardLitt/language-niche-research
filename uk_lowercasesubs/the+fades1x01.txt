technically   the mortgage repayments are too much  for only one of us to handle alone   it's just it can get    tricky   i mean  i knew she'd be out  and sarah's    she's fine with me having sex   we're only technically     technically     i just didn't want you in here   this her   yeah   she's pretty   yeah   and    i'm going to go now   yeah   just    a few too many technicalities for a

the future     it's ash   everybody dies  everybody's dead   you're in so much danger   i can't find a vein  i can't find a vein   what did he do to you   we all are   oh    all right  he's changing  neil   he's evolving  he's getting stronger   he'll lead others through   the fades are coming   the fades are coming  it's inevitable  i see it now  i see it   our world is dying   all that mattered was mark   and i wish i'd known that before   i don't want to     sarah     sarah   morning  love   oh   i've got it  mum  ok  no  you don't   mum     it's nothing to be ashamed of   yeah  it is   no  it isn't   well  do you remember what the dream was about   who said it was a dream  well  dr tremlett   mum   i'm not your little kid any more  ok   i'm not your boy  i'm trying to be a man   thanks  mum  no   no  it was the way you said it  it was funny   course you're a man  yeah  fine  sure   paul     paul   i just did these  shithead   paul   just leave him be  well  he just smudged my nails   just    i don't know what's going on with him   it's called being a teenage boy   he should be wanking  not pissing   you're going to have to write me a note   well  i'm not going to make my first class now  am i    i need to do these again   sarah     jesus   you surprised me   helen   hi  mark   hi   what    what are you doing here   i'm    stealing things  what are you doing here   um    it's my house   half of it   sarah gave me her key yesterday  asked me to pick something up   and before you ask  no  i don't know where she is   but i'm pretty sure she wouldn't like you in her room   last night was a bit  um     i got a bit    that would explain    those   it was less fun than you think  i'm not taking sides  mark   i think it's a sorry mess  but i'm     not taking sides  no  i know   do you  um    fancy a bit of breakfast   i thought you'd never ask   this is a bullet   no  mac  will you put it away   murder  murder  i've just been shot   like anyone pays the slightest attention to what we do  we're the unwashed   we're the unwanted  we're the invisible in this school   and this is a bullet   a slightly odd one  i think  which makes it even more exciting   it's not exciting   hi  jay   what  fuck off  paul   how we came out the same egg is a mystery to me   womb   we came out the same womb   egg and we'd be identical twins   and there are certain differences between us  if you hadn't noticed  uh  yeah  you're retarded   such a wanker  a bullet   a strange bullet casing which my best friend claims was fired at him   which makes my best friend indiana jones  which is good  because i've always wanted to be short round from temple of doom   or marion ravenwood from raiders when feeling particularly confused   that was smooth  by the way   ooh   what did you do that for   was it the marion ravenwood quip   i'm not coming out to you  i'm probably the most heterosexual person you know   mac  i'm scared   minus the sex  of course  i'm a hetero ual   you do know this is the girls' toilets  right   you're not taking this very seriously   shh   oh  i ain't got any toilet paper  have you got some   well  there's the female mystique fucked  then   sadly  that genuinely may have been the most sexual experience  of my entire life   i'm taking this very seriously   you got shot at  it's just    i talk when i'm nervous   i once told my mum the entire plot of the bible   old and new testament  when we was watching jaws   she was enthralled    actually   these dreams     i've been having   mate  those are natural things   beautiful things   shut up   yeah  you need to clean yourself up in the morning   like that gunk you got on your hand   your junk  that's the miracle of life right there  baby  right there   mac    don't you understand   they're dreams   my dreams are coming true   your dreams are coming    true   when that guy shot at me  i followed him   he fought     he fought with this       creature  i can't describe him  he wasn't human   the gun     and the bullet  they     prove it  don't they   that the dreams are sort of     real  which means i'm     which means i'm what   heather langenkamp from nightmare on elm street   that is such a compliment  heather langenkamp's an utter legend   ok  i will be heather   you be kim myers from nightmare on elm street 2   but honestly  mate  the film's not as good   i just wanted someone who believed me  course i believe you   do you think i'm mad  if you're mad  we'll find a way to cope with it   but it's equally possible that what you're seeing  is what other people can't  that you're  you know    special   special   special   i'm scared  mac   you're scared   my only friend is either a lunatic or heather langenkamp   i'm petrified   ok  you crazy kids   get ready  cos it is time for     his story   his story  history   that's the one   wow  tough crowd   ok  steve  if you wouldn't mind  thank you   right  who is ready for the holocaust   i was hoping it was you   i love the way you feel free  to just let yourself into people's places whenever you feel like it   this isn't a place   it's a hole   where were you last night   what happened to your eye   i kept ringing you   where were you  i had things to clean up   we need to bury her immediately   neil  we're still a team  no  we're your team   oh  that's the thing  is it  you want a go at playing the man   i got her gun   i collected it  this morning  from her place   good   i lost mine  my gun   i shot it and then he attacked me and i lost it   i got     i was    scared   ok  i was scared  this is sarah   your eye looks painful  neil   her body can keep   let me look at you first   i'm thinking pratchett   if i could get anyone to write my life story   pratchett  hey  you're walking very quickly   no  ok   um  a mix   pratchett's wit  definitely     alan moore's soul   and  um     susan cooper's plotting   yeah  clive lewis's heroism   and tolkien's slightly twisted sexuality   tolkien had a twisted sexuality   the eye of mordor   the man was clearly petrified of vaginas   what   what   can you      seriously  is this another of your jokes   because you're not good at jokes  and i've explained before   when you tell a joke  you've got to wink   that way i'll laugh  and we'll both feel better   you can't see her   you're not joking   yeah  i'm joking   winked  joking  that's not a wink   she said that the attack proved her vision right   the future was ash   it was death   didn't sound great   i don't understand why the attack proves that     it proves it because it's never happened before   the fades are not supposed to be able to touch us   i only just managed to fight him off  because he's weak  but he'll get stronger   he's breaking through  helen  he's becoming flesh   it's a big assumption  if he becomes flesh  others'll follow   so  as death becomes life  so life becomes death   and so everything ends  that's what the vision meant   let's not get too dramatic  shall we   i'm not sure if this is a cheese and onion  wednesday sort of day or a salt and vinegar friday   it is actually friday   sometimes you're disappointingly literal   oh  my god  i didn't even consider smoky bacon monday   get down  what   ohh     and ten marlboro lights  ok  love   thanks   hi  paul   yeah  found it   see you  paul  yeah   hi  i mean  yeah  i mean     bye   yeah  good  good  good  that went well   not an entirely romantic instrument  but     welcome to the world of beefy tuesdays   tuesday  of course   and ten marlboro lights   you got any id  kid   i'm 18  i've just got a young face   you could touch his stubble  if you want   if you're working for the thought police   i'll have your bollocks  all right  son   thanks   i mean  i'm not  i mean  i'm grateful     4 10   um  have you got any cash   does the pope shit in woods   can i owe you   2     i can move in here  for a   i'll do as i do   we can be safe here   it's non negotiable   we are not here to predict the future  neil   sarah was a seer   her inevitability isn't ours   we take every challenge    as it comes  i know that   what if the challenge is too great   what if the fades do break through  then you're right   we'll be fucked   does that make you feel better   i don't like it when you swear   she loves you   mac   she loves you not  mac  really    she loves you  mac  you need to stop   she loves you not   i will use physical violence on you   this is science   you need science   and you need love  moby dick   she loves you   that's just childish   this is going to hurt   i need to scrape out the poison   i couldn't save it   the eye's dead   he infected the cornea   you won't see out of that again   i couldn't have saved her  you know   sarah   any more than you could   her injuries were too severe   i know   i'll move in here  just until we understand what's happening   good   the truth is  it's simple   either the world ends or we stop him or     or something stronger comes along that can   you're back on this    creature who's going to save us all   why not   he's out there  neil  i know it   he could be a woman   i hear some of them do ok   careful  or i'll have the other eye   what is your problem   because i've asked you repeatedly to do it   and i've told you repeatedly  i won't  you look cheap  anna   so i should take style advice from you  should i  i may look cheap   but you look dead  if you dress like a slut  people will treat you like a slut   my mum actually thinks i dress like a prostitute   there's an ambition achieved   shh   i used to hide mine in a sock at the back of my drawer   you   yep  it's me   what are you     doing here   i'm looking for you   the boy who saw things he shouldn't be able to   well  maybe if you had dressed like a slut  he wouldn't have left   ever considered that    you've got two choices   you can scream and you'll get the whole house in here     or you can realise i've probably got some information you need to hear   ok  close your eyes   you just concentrate on my voice   empty your head of everything other than my voice   and now open your eyes   they like height   when organic matter passes through them  they burn  so     we see them on rooftops  and bus shelters  walking down the middle of the road   cars are fine  they get winged by a car  that doesn't hurt  so     what are they   they're the dead   the dead   and they're trapped here   they're dead    look  when people die  they go up or they stay here   some go up  some stay here   these are those that stay here   we call them the fades   they're just    trapped here   if they don't ascend  yeah   so these are bad people  good  bad   why people believe death is somehow fair     death is random  same as life is   life has famine   illness   shittiness  death is similarly crap   that's why the problem exists   the problem   you imagine being trapped in a world that you can't touch   you can't taste   hate grows   those that get left behind  they get shitty   it's    that    that thing that i saw attacking you   that was a shitty ghost   well  he was something new   and you      what are you   are you     some sort of    ghostbuster   yeah  that's right  kid  i'm a ghostbuster   and none of this     none of this stuff's in my head   ghostbuster's honour   you seem different today   different how   has something happened since our last session   i donated blood   right   maybe that's it   no   i didn't donate blood  that was a joke   you didn't laugh   i want to talk about your dad again   ok   it's probably a bit pointless  what do you want to say   now  you see  i think it's important that    the dreams  the bed wetting  didn't start until after the divorce   so he's the reason i'm mad  it's my dad's fault   i wish you'd stop using that word  i see    things  i     i look out the window and i see things  and i hate it and i want it to stop   i just    want it to stop   what do you see   just give me pills   give me a    lobotomy  just     make it stop  because i hate this   i'm not going to prescribe you anything  paul   then why am i here   you know  you remind me a lot of me when i was your age   is that supposed to be a compliment   there's a couple of things you should know  paul   one   you're never as odd as you think you are   and two   the things that scare us  are the things that keep us human   never be afraid of being scared   just don't allow being scared to dictate the choices you make   i didn't know you smoked   yeah  yeah   i'm just learning   i tried writing  l  on the cigarette in my sister's lipstick  but     well  you're bum sucking the shit out of that  the filter must be soaking   see   have you heard about the thing at the old shopping centre   no  police all around it   everyone's talking about it in school   current theory is someone got raped   yeah  yeah  and alicia's been off school   yeah  alicia   are you ok   you seem weirder than ever   yeah  yeah  yeah  no  i'm just     trying to decide if i'm mental  or not   what are your odds   my sister would kill you if she even sees you talking to me   she'd probably kill you  too   she doesn't believe in the intermingling of the species   even if it is just talking   guess you're all off out tonight   we're all off out every night  up the woods   just be careful of the  you know  rapist   you're not mental  you're just     different   that's what my mum used to say   your mum's wicked   she cleaned me up from whoever bullied me    oh  paul  someone's squirted tomato ketchup all over you    they're just scared of difference    oh  paul  someone's emptied a bin on your head    they're just scared     i always wanted to be different   i was a bit of a    hairbrush princess  you know   think i'm a pop star   i don't know  my dad thinks i'm better than everyone  so     well  i never wanted to be different   maybe i don't mean you're different   maybe i mean    special   you're the second one who's said something like that   i've got the taste of your spit in my mouth now   yeah   you've got nice eyes     in this light   yeah   i'd better go   all right   see ya   you've got nice eyes too  i know   mr etches  isn't it   you  er  taught me gcse history  mr etches   oh  right  yes  er  do you know what this is about   only  i just    the dci will tell you   phillip firth   i am  dc firth   right  yes  er  i remember now  phillip   yeah  how did you do in the end in your exams  i got a d   never was much shake at schoolwork  i     that's great   the dci is  er  just through here   dci armstrong entering the room   er  the time is 5 27    pm   so    what's this about   when was the last time you saw your wife   sarah   er  she's not my wife   well  barely   ok  when was the last time you saw sarah   pff  um    the day before yesterday   some    time   what's this about   we had sarah's dna in our file   why   i can't  for operational reasons  divulge that at this point   well  is she ok  you're beginning to scare me now   this morning    a weapon was found   an adapted gun     in the hinkley way shopping centre   the derelict place   patrol dogs found it   nearby  we found some clothing with     sarah's blood on it   her blood   this doesn't mean    it shouldn't mean that     when do we start looking for her  we're sending out a search team   what we need from you  are a list of all her friends     mark  mark   you're gonna be vital to this investigation   you can trust him  mr etches   he's a good guy   how was the session  fine   you're gonna talk to me properly  er    mac's waiting  mum   let him   he    said that dad was the reason i was screwed up  basically   then he said i reminded him of him  and that was sort of  the end of the session  he said your dad was the reason   dad or the divorce  i dunno  i didn't     can we talk about it another time   we're always talking about it another time  you and me  aren't we   yeah  well  that's because another time always is the best time   i am allowed to be worried about you   i know you are  mum   paul  you haven't even eaten   good for me  bad for me  bye   hi  mum   meg  sorry   i know   i'll make sure he gets his protein   i'm a big fan of protein   yeah  you too   bye   parental quicksand  something like that   you know  the easiest way to escape quicksand is by raising your legs slowly  so you lie on your back   your actual back   then you just float   takes balls  but it's possible   you ok   yeah   i mean  er  heather langenkamp stuff     i knew what you meant  cos i've had a thought   what thought   sixth sense   would you say everything you've ever learnt about was from films  mac   no   television's been doing some important work for me recently   then there's the complicated    nay  thorny issue of internet pornography   yeah   admittedly  the isolated incidents they show in the film   maybe bruce willis could have been a ghost for those   that bit with his wife and the wedding ring   i like that bit   what about the rest of his life  the bits the film doesn't show   i mean  what if he feels like a coffee   he walks into his standard american brand coffee place and goes     hi   i'd like a coffee  please   no answer   excuse me  but  er  i'd like a cup of coffee   no answer   they can't see him   he's a ghost   i mean  eventually he's gonna get pretty  you know  annoyed   yeah  ok  it's a fatal flaw   hello  hello  wh    where's my coffee   mate  like  he hasn't guessed he's a ghost   bruce willis looks like a man who likes a coffee   you ok  paul   who's here   what is it  where is it   paul  wait up  i haven't finished my theory   paul  paul   ahh   and who the fuck are you    it's gonna happen a lot  isn't it   good point  well made   so  you made your decision  then   oh  f     you again   yep  me again   who is she   sarah   her name's sarah   she's a friend   yep   they can talk   she can right now   she's looking for a place to pass   this wood's one of the few places in the country not fucked with enough  to still have passing places   what   there are holes in the world   ascension points   used to be loads of them  then man invented concrete   look   there's another  what are those  the     the lights in their    in their chest   they're beacons   when the dead near ascension  their souls shine   those that pass  that light     that'll take over their whole body with a bang   those that don't   that light turns off   that's when they know they're trapped here for ever   so  this is    this is ascension   this is    this is about heaven  heaven is a big word   this is about death  kid   only death   come on   fucking birds   collateral damage   will any of this ever make sense   probably not   do you know how much danger you're    we're in   probably a lot   oh  shit   neil   neil  she's not going   she's not passing   what   i'm sorry  sarah   i'm so sorry   oh  i feel     it's     paul   paul  paul   what did you see   look at me  paul   look at me  paul  what did you see   what are you   your best friend
