i reckon that lad's been killed by one of his mates   you know  been out on the piss  some joke gone wrong   tried to wake him up the morning after the night before  dead   they panicked and they put him in the arcade   did you find out where he's getting his money   i'm not sure how that helps us build a case against him  sir     do you remember hitting that lad    no     you sure    yes  i'm sure     you're not shitting me  are you    no  i'm not shitting you   the age difference is wrong  we shouldn't be doing it     steve  what is this about    sorry  shyanne  it's all over   we're living in a leisure economy  terry  we can't lose   i've read the brochure  i just can't see how all this is going to happen   will you stop talking like a tart   is the bloke who talked to you called carlisle     what difference does it make    he's the one to watch   i want to tell you everything and i want to know everything about you     it's insane    i know   can i kiss you    remember who your mates are  ripley   i'm trying  i'm really trying       he thought he was the king of america    where they pour coca cola just like vintage wine    now i try hard not to become hysterical    but i'm not sure if i am laughing    or crying    i wish that i could push a button    and talk in the past    and not the present tense    and watch this hurtin' feeling disappear    like it was common sense    it was a fine idea at the time    now it's a brilliant    mistake    he thought he was the king of america    but it was just a boulevard of broken dreams    a trick they do with mirrors and with chemicals    the words of love in whispers    and the acts of love in screams    i wish that i could push a button    and talk in the past    and not the present tense    and watch this lovin' feeling disappear    like it was common sense    i was a fine idea    at the time    now i'm a brilliant    mistake    the inland revenue have issued a summons  for full payment of the outstanding tax bill and accumulated fines   if you don't pay it by tomorrow   the bailiffs come and start auctioning your assets   my escape fund  but i won't hold that against you     this doesn't even start to cover it    what do i owe   about 80 000 all told   how did that happen   it's very easy  you don't pay your bills  you don't return my calls   put the expansion plans on hold  you might just be able to stay afloat     i can't do that    ripley  you don't have a choice anymore   they will close you down   i can't do that because i've already spent the expansion budget on this place   the only way you can get the money to build the casino hotel  is to build the casino hotel to get the money   i'm just borrowing from tomorrow   haven't you ever heard of it  it's called economics   i'm your effing accountant   didn't you think you should share any of this with me   well  i didn't want to worry you   you could remortgage the arcade for short term funds     though it's not a great idea      then that's what we'll do   if you're going to get the golden goose  you've got to slay a few giants   not interrupting anything  am i   we know mike hooley died from a blow to the head with a blunt instrument   his blood tests turned up stimulants which speeded up his heartbeat   so that when he got the head injury  it sped up the cerebral bleed   so it were an accident  that's that  then     do you need any help packing    it's no accident that he was hit  and that's what killed him   so i'll be staying around until i find the man who hit him   the white cliff flats behind this arcade  they're yours  aren't they   they're in your wife's name  but to all intents and purposes  they're yours   right   forensics have found traces of mike hooley's hair and blood  in the white cliff flats   well  in the circumstances  i won't be charging rent   so mike hooley's body was moved from your flats to your arcade  by someone who had keys to both   the keys aren't going to turn up now  are they   why do you say that     only a prick'd hold onto the evidence    perhaps it's a prick i'm looking for   and you've made a statement that you sent danny home in a cab  at around midnight  so that's him in the clear   oh  and     we've got a witness who saw you in romeo's nightclub  at the same time as mike hooley   said you two had an altercation   i know where you're getting this shit   i'd be surprised if you did      i tried so hard not to come   i thought i'd said everything the other day   i hadn't   i've been scared of your dad since school   and when i found out that you were his daughter     i know it sounds stupid  but in my darkest thoughts    i thought that maybe he'd sent you    what   that's crazy   i know   but     it seemed so unlikely that somebody like you  would fall for somebody like me   anyway     when you first met me  what did you see     what    what did you see   i saw a beautiful young woman who laughed at my jokes   and     one time your smile stayed and i thought  for a moment  that maybe  there was something about me that you found     what's the point of this  shyanne   what you felt then     that's what's real   nothing's changed  it's just you and me   not my dad  not your age   just how we feel about each other   all the rest of it is just stuff   just stuff   yeah  i was going for the big finish but i kind of blew it  i think   you're brilliant  you know that   and you promise not to be scared off by him again   scared off by him   after the other day when you started taking your clothes off in the theatre  it's you i'm scared of   so somebody killed mike hooley  then kept his body in ripley's flats for 24 hours   i imagine that passes for normal in these parts   anybody could have access to those flats  you ring the doorbell and you're in   we start with hailey  that prostitute  don't we   no sign of a struggle in her room  no sign of a struggle full stop   what if danny hit him outside the flat  then needed to stash the body inside   danny  have you seen the size of him   no  that's far more ripley's style   we've got evidence that danny was in a fight  not ripley   without a witness i'm not sure we can say the fight happened at all   it's a paradox that wittgenstein would have a lot to say about   let's bring him in for interview       have you thought anymore about what i was saying about jim   i'm getting too old for this lark   my heart's beating like i don't know what   i've just had carlisle down the arcade   he knows more about what i own and what i don't own than i do     someone's filling in the blanks for him    have you ever had that  you know   when you can talk to a woman dead easy  make her laugh  and then the minute you start to fancy her it's like you forget how to speak   who was standing next to me at romeo's   who can put me there   jim allbright  snitch bastard   look  i know you're wrong about him   you know  your trouble is you're too trusting     i've got a date    oh     any money changing hands    no  just a nice  normal woman   i've forgotten how to behave normally around a normal woman   just do what i do   if you start feeling intimidated  imagine her taking a dump   why do you have to drag everything down to the sewer   because i feel at home there     when is it    tonight   that's lucky  then   you can take that shirt back  you look like a badly wrapped toffee apple     right  that is me done    any interesting calls   no  nothing too worrying   did he ring   no  i wasn't expecting him to   was he blond when he died   yeah   why do young lads dye their hair  it never looks nice   so  do you remember seeing him   i can't see much at all in here  it's very cramped   yeah   no wonder you can't digest your food properly   ripley ought to build you a roomier booth   i couldn't ask him to do that  he's spent a fortune on the new machines   it doesn't help you to untwist your diaphragm though  does it   it's good for all of us     yeah  is that what he likes to tell you    i mean all of us shareholders   you're a shareholder  in what   the arcade  the casino hotel  when it's built   we all are  me  deaf barry  maureen aurtice and other people     people who know about business    what sort of people   you know  his mates  pillows of the community   right  yeah  i mean  they'd have to be  wouldn't it   to invest in a place like this     hello    hello   what are you doing here   i was just at a loose end   is this it  is this your husband's arcade   i don't believe it  now i'm giving him my money as well as the love of my life   can we talk     yeah  but not here    i know somewhere   it's actually carved out from the cave under the tower   i thought that might be exciting to a quantity surveyor   and the fish  seem to stand in line at the window  it's like they're queuing for something   is this what you wanted to talk to me about   when i think about you  i feel guilty   when i saw you just now at the arcade  i felt guilty   it's like     you've become the real relationship and i'm cheating on you with ripley   i don't know what you want me to say to that   well     perhaps you could tell me if you felt anything     like the same way   you're married   you knew that when you dated me   you knew that when you kissed me   did it seem wrong then     no    what about that stuff you said about     feeling as though you'd been waiting for me   does it still feel like that when you look at me now   you must know it does   you're going to have to be the one that walks away this time   can we go somewhere with a few less eyes       you know how to skweeze me    whoa  oh  oh    you know how to pleeze me    whoa  oh  oh    you're learnin' it easy    whoa  oh  oh    and i thought you might like to know    when a girl's meaning yes she says no    you got rude talk    you got one walk    all your jokes are blue    you got long nails    you tell tall tales    some you think are true    and there's nowhere to go you won't go    if there's nowhere to run  you go slow    if you move up to me then i'll show you the way    then you'll know    how to skweeze me    whoa  oh  oh    you know how to pleeze me    whoa  oh  oh    you're learnin' it easy    whoa  oh  oh    and i thought you might like to know    how to skweeze me    whoa  oh  oh    you know how to pleeze me    whoa  oh  oh    you're learnin' it easy    whoa  oh  oh    and i thought you might like to know    when a girl's meaning yes  she says no    they've turned me down  my planning application   they've turned me down  me     they can't    they bloody have  look    after due consideration and consultation with adjacent businesses       the ungrateful bastards    it doesn't make sense   it does if someone's bad mouthing me   talk about multiculturals like they talk about arcade owners  they lock you up   maybe they thought the design would be an eyesore   an eyesore  we're building las bleeding vegas     what're you going to do    you're the copper   why would i have any sway with the enterprise committee   they can turn me down because my arcade attracts unsavoury elements   one corpse  slightly soiled  you've got to clear my name   how many times  it's not my case  carlisle's his own man   you don't get it  do you   without the planning permission  no casino   without the casino we're all sunk   so i'd make it your case if you want to see your money ever again     your eyes are blue with     a small speck of brown   you've got a birthmark on your calf that looks like a splash   go on   you've got scars on your arm from when you started a tattoo    and then thought better of it    which arm   erm     your left  on the back of your wrist     and    and     i love every inch of you   and one day when you look at me and say    what am i doing with this old bloke    at least i'll have remembered you all off by heart   that is not going to happen     let's go for a walk    now   i just don't want us to hide away   like we should be ashamed or something   like it's something seedy   although i am kind of getting to like the seediness   that's it  we're definitely going for a walk   what does it take to get served round here   come on  mate  i just want a bit of whizz   i can't help you  mate   how about you show me someone who can help me   come on  i've got to survive a week in blackpool   you're not going to make me do that without the aid of chemicals  are you   follow me   what you doing in blackpool   a sales conference  what about you     i'm stuck here    you could get out if you wanted to     maybe    a sharp lad like you     do you reckon    you dress nice  good looking   i don't know about that   what   what   it's going to liven up round here  anyway   haven't you heard  it's going to be las vegas   yeah   so what do you do while you're waiting for it to liven up   wait there       the boy with the thorn in his side    behind a hatred there lies    a murderous desire    for love    how can they look into my eyes    and still they don't believe me    how can they hear me say those words    still they don't believe me    and if they don't believe me now    will they ever believe me    and if they don't believe me now    will they ever  they ever  believe me    oh no    the boy with the thorn in his side    behind the hatred there lies    a plundering desire    for love    how can they see the love in our eyes    and still they don't believe us    and after all this time    they don't want to believe us    and if they don't believe us now    will they ever believe us    and when you want to live    how do you start where do you go    who do you need to know           i've got to talk to you    it's not really a good time     it's important    i've got company   am i the only one who cares   i'd neck anything anybody gave me when i was your age   speed  dope  acid  anything to stop me feeling angry   why don't you just arrest me   well  i could   but i'd rather you told me what you and your dad were doing  on the night mike hooley died   like dad told you  he put me in a taxi at midnight   i must have been home by half past   that still gave you time to sell mike hooley some gear   i didn't sell him any gear   it's a 3 to 1 chance that you did  because the autopsy came back and he had cannabis     and amphetamine sulphate and amyl nitrate in his system   which meant that when he got hit later that night he dropped like mr slinky   when his head hit the ground he was only good news for the funeral director   i didn't hit him   well  somebody did   you'd already seen him at the arcade   then your dad had argued with him at the club  and then you had maybe sold him some drugs   it seems you and your dad crossed his path a few times on the night he died   he died in one of your dad's bedsits  he died because somebody hit him   it wasn't me   but you know who it was   am i correct   you do  don't you  deep down   somewhere in that pissed up night you remember  because you would remember something like that   it's sitting in your head right now screaming  tell him   at you  isn't it   you're the man  you're the man   come back to me when you've done some work on your criminal patter   so  where do you work  mary   at gifts galore  on the front   so what happened   terry come in and ask for a shake of your snow storms   something like that   he's a bit of a catch  you know  he's got plenty to choose from   so  i'd go that extra mile if you want to hang on to him       that'll be your cab  love    no  i called it for you  ripley     no  i'll take it    what   it's been a lovely evening  terry  i'll call you   about time and all     didn't you hear about a friend in need    thanks a million   we've been turned down for planning permission for the casino hotel     what do you think about that    i don't care   you will  when you're left with a falling down b b with a fancy bathroom   for one evening  i don't care   we were getting along  me and her  we were talking   yeah  i want to talk  all right   i want to talk about vegas turning over four million thousand dollars a year   and i want to ask what's so wrong with wanting a slice of that   so i want to talk  all right   yes  but you don't want to listen  do you   that's why it was so nice talking to a woman for a change   it is before you've shagged them  but that's your cock playing the ventriloquist   for the first time since elaine left me i felt  you know  all right   like i used to before my life turned to shit   if i don't get planning permission for the casino hotel   you'll be taking a plunge in the sewage farm   yes  and do you know why  because i listen to you   somewhere in everything that's gone wrong  somehow or other   you are always there   what's the opposite of a lucky mascot  that's you  that is   oh  yeah   and who picked up the pieces for you after the divorce   who was there for you then   yeah  and there for my wife  too  according to the rumours   i never fancied elaine   maybe not before the boob job   you don't want to drive an old transit just 'cause it's got new headlamps   i could come back to yours for a while     i've got to work tomorrow    go on   this is what it's like going out with an old man   you've been warned  go on       you still up   i couldn't sleep   you don't drink enough     you all right    yeah   bearing up   yeah   you know the first machine i ever bought     space invader    the holy grail   the first baby since pinball  that you put money in without wanting to win anything back   i saw it and i knew   and that's how i got started   and it was all so simple   and i spent what i earned   if i didn't have it  i didn't spend it   so simple  you know   no mortgage  no wife  no kids  simple  simple  simple   not that i'm saying i regret     what i'm saying is     responsibility     changes you   it makes you do things that you might not normally do   do you hear what i'm saying   ah  deputy chief inspector allbright   nice to see you taking an avuncular interest   we'll all be grateful when you tie this one up     we    the whole town   we don't need bad publicity putting off the tourists   especially a new investment like ripley holden's arcade   there's no doubting that   i imagine an arcade needs a clean reputation  to get planning permission for a casino hotel   you heard about the planning permission  then   young blythe here's like a terrier on the research side   i'm not unsympathetic to a businessman's plight   glad to hear it   i think if i had money tied up in ripley holden's business   i'd want to ensure that any     inconvenient obstacles to its success were removed   well  who wouldn't   i might even be tempted to provide a false alibi   if that's what it took   now what type of man would do that   i don't know   the type of man who's easily bought   i suppose i've got you to thank for this  have i   what is it   don't pretend you don't know   we'll just appeal the planning permission  we'll get there in the end   never underestimate the power of prayer   all this will be casino hotels  hallworth   gambling is blackpool  so why pick on me   you think i objected to your planning permission   do you really think they'd take any notice of me   no  thanks   if you can't enjoy yourself in this life   you're not exactly best placed to enjoy paradise when you get there   for a non believer  you're very concerned about  getting to heaven  aren't you   maybe i'll be one of those last minute converts  that the shepherd rejoices over more than the 99 that never went astray   but then you'd be missing out on having jesus on your side in your lifetime   i look at you and i look at me  and i just might be able to live with that     you're very cynical    no  i think you're the cynical one   if i do something good  i do it because i think it's the right thing to do   if you do it  it's to please god   when did you last do something good   this morning  when i opened the doors of this place  and let people in to have a good time   when did you last do something good which didn't benefit you   i give to charity all the time   that's just so you don't have to get your own hands dirty   so if i did something good   something for somebody else  do you think my luck might change   then you wouldn't be doing it for someone else  would you   no  believe me  this time i would   can i have a word     how's your coffee    fine  thanks   i was a bit pissed off last night   i realised that   i'd had a bit to drink so i think i might have gone a bit too far   things i said about terry   i'm not going to judge terry by what you say about him   no  but you might judge him on the mates he keeps  and i know i didn't make a good impression   you might think terry's not a nice bloke and he is   i know that  i was planning on calling him   were you  great  when   do you think i'm going to tell you after last night   fair enough  fair enough   so  have you shagged every woman in blackpool over forty   more or less   but terry doesn't need to know that i'm one of them  does he   no   a bloke doesn't like to drink out of a dirty cup  does he  i mean  no offence   none taken   i've caught ripley in a lie and he knows it   i've got the son knowing that we're onto his dad   and i've got allbright doing his impression of a whipped pup     and ripley's wife    what about her   have you worked out what she's hiding   i don't think she's hiding anything  don't think she's involved   what you saying  she doesn't know he's a villain     she married young    she stayed with him  didn't she   you don't know what you're talking about     hello   hi   i'm on site   of course  where do you want me to be   i haven't done this since     you haven't done this ever  i hope   not this   i mean  this   been away from the world   forgotten everything   what do you need to forget   a husband who lies to me  and who i'm cheating on for the first time in my life   a daughter who's dating a man her dad's age     and a son who stays out all night  is that enough for starters   a bit wild is he  your boy   no   that's the funny thing  i don't think he is     but he stays out all night    no  i'm exaggerating   it was this party that we had because ripley was opening the new arcade   i think he just got a bit fed up of ripley getting all the attention     and who wouldn't    big party  was it   hm  yeah   there isn't any other kind as far as ripley's concerned   it's one of the great things about him   he knows how to celebrate   you know when i said i wanted to know everything about you   yeah   i didn't mean everything   are you jealous   i'm jealous of everybody who is with you when i'm not with you   everybody who passes you in the street   yeah  you could say i'm jealous     that's my phone     leave it    i can't     leave it    i can't   i didn't know who else to call   you should have called me straight away  of course you should   what are the doctors saying   steve was scared of dad already   i should have listened to him   what do you mean   you don't think your dad beat steve up  do you   you can't really think that   i don't want you here if you're going to stand there and pretend     terry corlette's only gone and got himself a girlfriend   not bad looking  either  he's punching above his weight     what's wrong    i've been at the hospital   why  what's the matter  are you all right  is it the kids   shyanne's boyfriend got beaten up  suspected fractured skull   i didn't even know she had a boyfriend   steve  she's been seeing steve again   she lied to us   do you want to know how badly he was hurt or do you already know   oh   if you tell me what it is you want to hear  i'd be only too glad to say it   did you have anything to do with beating steve up   no  i didn't  but i wish i bloody well had   your dad was one of the wild lads at school   he did a bit of fighting  a bit of bullying  nobody in particular   just anyone who got in his way  really   and that was you   no   i don't remember us ever even speaking before it happened   what happened   he    shoved letters through the doors of about six kids at the school   addressed to their parents   every one of them saying something bad about their son   you know   your kid smokes    your kid's a poof   that kind of thing   and what did he say on yours   it just said    steve lomas bullies me    that's why i had to do this    what did he mean  do what   just straight after he'd posted the six letters  your dad tried to kill himself   dad   no  that can't be right   he got out of it on cider and lay down on the railway line  but somebody came and found him   dragged him off the line before the train came   but i'd know   i'd know if he was the type to try and kill himself   maybe he was then   he said you'd been bullying him   his idea of a joke  i think   i must have weighed about three stone   so why did he choose you   i don't know  i never found out   he never came back to school   and i was left with this name for myself   this monster who'd driven this poor kid to suicide   and everybody believed him   my mates  my mum and dad     what i couldn't get over  what drove me mental   was i don't know what i did to deserve it   why don't you ask him now   because i could tell  when i met him again after all those years     he hasn't changed   and he'd love it that it's been in my head all this time     are you all right    fine  yeah   is that fine yeah  as in mind your own business    or do you want me to ask you more    i said i was fine  didn't i   i always had this idea     that my children would be able to talk to me about anything   i know what it's like to carry a guilty secret around inside  you know   i was interviewed by the police   okay  when was this   a few days ago   and what had you been doing   this copper is trying to say that i had a fight with the bloke who died   he picked me up again the other night  he isn't going to let it go   can't jim allbright put him right   jim doesn't know him  he's not from round here   right  what's his name   why  what do you want to know for   is he an inspector or a sergeant or what   see  i knew you'd get like this   i can find out and i'll sort it out   that's exactly why i didn't tell you   trust me  i'll sort it out   excuse me  i'm looking for an officer  he's in charge of the mike hooley case   that's all i know  i'm sorry   it'd be d i  carlisle you want  he's working on it   just through there   thank you   when i said i wanted your help  i didn't mean by losing your cash on my machines   i had a chat with carlisle   i think it's better if i take my money out of this place     so how does that help

day looks like   so you don't want to know what sort of day i've had  then   so when you said  good day   it was a trick question so that you could pick me up when i didn't ask you back   we need to be more honest with each other   any more honest than this and we'll be at each other's throats   i mean it     you start    what's got into you   and what are you looking so shaky about  your mum find your porn mags   what   what is it   hey  love   i'm really gutted about what happened to steve  how is he   are you not going to have anything to eat   i'd better go and have a word   why do you have to go running after her all the time   and why are you being like this   i wouldn't hurt anyone that meant that much to you   no   you'd just tell someone else to  that's how it works  isn't it   i can't believe you'd think i'd do something like this     come on  it's me  your dad    so   it turns out there's a lot of things i don't know about my dad   what's that supposed to mean   steve's been filling me in on your past  at school   the notes   you trying to kill yourself  you know  the small stuff   he told you about that  did he   don't say it like it's nothing   well  it's     it was a long time ago   you tried to kill yourself and you've forgotten all about it   i was a teenager   you know  my dad was a religious nutter   my mum hadn't got out of bed for six weeks because elvis presley had died   just stupid teenager  messed up   i'm sorry you had to learn it from somebody else  i didn't want that   none of this means that i had steve beaten up  does it   and is that it  that's your explanation  end of story   why are you behaving like this   when did i ever lie to you  eh   you don't fool me  dad   come on  shyanne   me and you     we've always understood each other  haven't we   it's always been me and you   you're my daughter  for god's sake   not now i'm not   not anymore   she looked at me like she didn't even know me   she's been like that with me all her life  you'll get used to it   i feel like she's hit me  right here   people get rejected   people say things they don't mean   people lie  people cheat  people hurt each other   why is any of this news to you   thank you  julie andrews   now just give us a quick chorus of my favourite things  and i'll be well and truly cheered up   you must have said stuff when you were a teenager   all those rows you must have had with your dad   that were different  he deserved it   have you been on a diet or something   you look different   no   i'm just tired   what's wrong   nothing  i     i just can't switch as quickly as you can  from worrying about the kids to  you know  us   it's easy   i'll show you   you turning me down   danny's still up  he might hear us    dad can be a bit of a twat sometimes  can't he   you don't mean that  you're all over him   i am not   yes  you are  and he treats you like shit   he doesn't   why are you sticking up for him after what he's done   i don't think dad beat up steve   he wouldn't do that   sure   like he didn't beat up that bloke they found dead in the arcade   come on  you don't believe he did that  do you   do you   dad had been drinking   he had keys and the alarm code   the guy had been winding dad up at the opening   anybody could have taken the keys   you know and i know that office is always locked   and sooner or later someone's going to tell the coppers   it won't be you  will it   not me   but someone   and do you know what   right now  i'm glad   i think he deserves everything he gets     danny  what are you doing down here  cock   i've come to see carlisle   what  has he called you in for an interview again   no   i came on my own  i've got something to communicate   where's your dad   he doesn't know i'm here   and your solicitor  what are you doing   i'm just going to talk to carlisle   like i should have done when this all started   don't move  all right  don't move   he didn't call ahead   no  the desk sergeant said he just turned up     has he got a solicitor    he says he doesn't want one   we've got the social worker on his way     no mention of his dad    he doesn't want his dad here   no  of course he doesn't  this is it   we just sit there and listen  i knew he'd come around   didn't realise it would be this quick   ripley  natalie  it's jim again   where the hell are you  ring me when you get this message   it's about danny  he's shown up at the police station   one of you needs to get down here   he says he's going to talk to carlisle     come on  answer  you bastard     do you know any good solicitors    let's worry about that later   did he give you any idea what he was going to say   no  he was just blank  staring into space   he's always like that  isn't he  he's a teenager  give me more than that   why would he want to speak to carlisle without you there     did you come down here voluntarily  danny   yes  i did   so what do you want to tell us   before  when i told you about the bloke in the arcade     mike hooley  the victim  this man   yeah   i lied   and why did you do that  danny   because of my dad   okay  i know this is difficult   because i wanted my dad to be proud of me   i can understand that  anybody could understand that   so what do you want to tell us now  about your dad   i killed mike hooley   you killed him  i don't think that's really true  is it danny   i sold him drugs and then i had a fight with him  about money   you have to think about what you're saying  son   you could be in a lot of trouble if you stick to this story   i killed him  i sold him drugs  i beat him up   i killed him
