  and the party was ok   rae  these sessions are meant to be a time when you can open up   discuss with someone  confidentially  how you're really feeling   i told you  it was all right   tell me how you're feeling right now   but be honest   ok  i'll tell you how l feel  yeah   two weeks ago  my wife kicked me out   i've been stopping on my brother's couch ever since   this morning  i wake up  and there's no milk   i bought that fucking milk  and he used it to drown his sugar puffs in   so  with no cup of coffee  i come to work  i get shat on by a pigeon   i meet my new patient  and she's about as open as a nun's foo   so   how do you feel   pffff     i feel like i hate being here   i feel like i hate this room   what do you hate most about it   well  the pictures   they're shit   won't you get into trouble for that   no  if anyone asks  i'll tell them that you did it   i'll say you're lying   who will they believe  i'm not the one with a history of mental illness   oh  wow   what about the ink blot   oh  that reminds me of a sanitary towel   then out it goes   oh   what about buster keaton here   no  i quite like that one   yeah  me too   what did your instincts say about me     after five seconds   i can't remember   i don't believe you   my instincts said     that you see yourself as a fragile thing   like a little broken bird  sloshing around in a bottle   but if you trust me  if we trust each other     that you'll be all right   because  basically  i think you're a pretty tough cookie     chop    yes  my dear   come and use those big swans you've been building  to prise my fat butt out of this slide   not a problem  rae   barman  a lemon hooch if you'd be so kind   and turn that shit off   who's going to the chippy  cos i'm yamming   oh  maybe we should play a game for it   all right  yeah  i've got a good one   what   maybe     last one into the pool should go   whoo   weh hey   whoo   'the doctors looked at my legs and said didn't it hurt   ' didn't it hurt so much when you were doing it  ' that it burnt to breathe    'at least they remind me that i survived   'but only just   'i can't believe i've actually got a group of friends   'i can't believe i'm finally out '  'i can't believe they actually think i'm getting better '
