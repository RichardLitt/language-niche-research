called for an autumn budget     i'm not mad  i'm not   i had an accident   and i woke up  now  that either makes me     a time traveller or    a lunatic   or     i'm lying in a hospital bed in 2006 and none of this is real    that's where you're saying you're from   see  maya   that's my girlfriend    she's been kidnapped by the same killer  who strangled susie tripper yesterday   i think you should go to a hospital and ask them to check you for concussion   he'll hold her for a day  and then     don't you see  it's the same killer in both times   paranoid delusion  brought about by the accident   it's not concussion  it's psychological   pretty fancy words for a wpc   i studied psychology at university   i'm just saying  i think it's a medical thing  and you should sign off sick and see somebody   what if you're my mind telling me this is real   you'll have to work this one out on your own   thanks   you know  for     listening to what i had to say and then not calling the men in the white coats   di tyler   you don't seem like the rest of them   and you're clever enough to know that what you're saying can't be true   yes  it's beating     i have to go    where   what do you

n ratio could be derived from the simple numenary  a   as the constant 10 and depicted thus   but what concerns us most is regulating his breathing   that is why we have to keep the endotrachial tube in place   i have to stress to you that sam is in low responsiveness   but is not in a persistant vegetative state   although he has suffered a severe cranial trauma   but the glasgow scale does put him at a deep level of coma   hey   you're talking about me   i'm here  i can hear you  look at me  i'm here   at times  however  he moves  murmurs   has motor response as though caught up in some sort of     deep rem sleep from which he cannot wake   well  this gives us some hope  despite the brain stem bruising   hey  i'm here   look at me  does this look like low responsiveness to you   i'm here   sam     i can hear you  i can hear you    sam tyler   wait  no   wait  don't leave me  i'm in bupa   please don't leave me   no  please  i'm here   don't leave me here   please don't leave me

that you don't hide anything from me   so  have you got a hunch about this case   with what i know  i could find this killer   prove it   look for these leads cropping up in any box in the room    priority   priority  will call   so where did you get these names from   call it inspiration   to predict what this killer might do next   we have to understand what he's thinking and feeling   annie   you're familiar with this case  aren't you   yes  sir   could you help us out here  please   wpc cartwright has a ba in psychology   now the victim wasn't gagged   why didn't he gag her  annie   forget the mind reading act   let's get down to the strip tease   because he needed to     he needed to see a mouth   the lips   we have to see the things that we value   now put yourselves in the mind of this man   you're lonely   every night  you dream of this girl     and she's got big eyes  and red  ruby lips   so you go out and you find that girl   and you bring her home   but you don't gag her   'cause you want to see those ruby lips   but you just can't bring yourself to kiss 'em   you get embarrassed   angry   you'd start to blame the girl   it's her fault   she's taunting him just by being there   and then one day  you just snap   strangle her  using bootlace   and then the cycle starts all over again  with a different girl   and this time   you're positive you're gonna be brave enough to kiss her   only you won't be   i look at your lips all the time  cartwright   d'you think i should turn myself in   i think you'd better trot along now  sweetheart   before i have to hose this lot down   yes  sir   thank you   how would he keep her quiet without gagging her   i don't know   alright   maybe this nutter moved to the area recently   maybe he's on day release from the loony bin   maybe there's a new face in the local boozers   let's find out  let's not wait for another skirt to wind up dead   and let's just hope we haven't been led up a blind alley   sorry sir
