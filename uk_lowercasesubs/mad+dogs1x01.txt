relationships   i didn't say that  i didn't say that   mind you  maybe you're better off in the long term   i mean  look at him   she's taken you to the cleaners  hasn't she  the missus   why would you say that   who's got the house  the car   she needs the car for the school run   and then there's the maintenance   she hasn't just taken you to the cleaners   she's sticking your head inside the washing machine  and making you sniff her dirty knickers   right   we're just over this   why don't we just       follow the road round   you're past it  mate   let's go     hey  i honestly think he's a bit cracked   maybe it's living here on his own  he's got no mates  has he   it's like we're the only people he's got in his life  and we're never around  so     so speak english     well  fuck off then  i don't care  no   is he speaking to that jesus   if he's going to carry on like this  i'm going home   how   just get on a plane  bit ungrateful  innit    he'd never speak to us again   we've known him 25 years  we can't just fuck off and leave   he just gave us his villa   maybe he just got over excited because we're all here  and he's just trying to show off   hey   we can stand up to him  you know   we don't have to do everything he says  we're not fucking kids   alright  then   we all stick together on this  ok   united front   yeah  right   it's nothing too fancy  just  sort of

you  baxter   there's no lucky lady   you've asked me that  twice  what was that        mad  crazy bird you saw last time you split up with your missus  before you bottled it and went back to her   brazilian  brazilian  wasn't she   she was nuts   tasty  but nuts   they're the best in bed  though  ain't they   you can't beat a bit of low self esteem in the sack   you know  cos they're like  up for everything   they're so grateful   i bet your jenny  she was a bit like that  wasn't she   why would you say that   because she topped herself  didn't she   how much lower can self esteem get   what     it's ok  i know what he was trying to say    do you   well  it's not like it didn't happen   talk about timing  though   just when you get clean  she offs herself    right  listen  why don't we change the subject   you do know he was going to leave her  don't you   that's the irony  you    shut up  alvo   whatever you say  man  whatever you say   what shall we talk about them   what about rick's little liaison   and now he's got to try and stop the quinnster  from telling nina all about it  because  as we all know  deep down   he's still in love with her  you're out of order  alvo   yeah  i know  i know  i don't need this   thank you for including me but i don't want any part of your villa   of course you don't  because you think you're better than me   you always thought you

boys  let's take a breather   i mean  we are on holiday   or we could just talk about what a total shitpile  baxter's made of his life   there is absolutely nothing you can say to me that will have any effect   you're a fraud  right   you want people to believe you're something you're not   ok  come on  just get it all off your chest   spew it all out  let's hear it   isn't it fucking ironic that the man who has everything   underneath it all  is just a deeply unhappy human being   unlike you  quinn  the person who has absolutely fuck all   i want nina back   what you banging on about her for   he's just had a little too much to drink   yeah  unhappy living like this     since when did happiness become about buying stuff   listen  alvo  i'd like my phone back now  now   look     i'm sorry  i'm sorry   the thing is  is i    i       needed you all to     well  i didn't need you  i wanted to see you   no  i needed to see you   this is    this is my fault   this is my fault really   but  i mean  like  like i said     did i say that      who are the people that you turn to   you know  when     it's tony blair   tiny blair  more like       i don't know anything about a fucking boat  mate   dna  i'm like a walking fucking petri dish of evidence   you can't phone the police     sorry  alv   people don't get away with stuff like this
