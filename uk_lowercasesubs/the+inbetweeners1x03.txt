   1  episode 3  thorpe park  so  i'm halfway through my first term in a new school     nice badge  dickhead    and it could've been worse     i will get you    i still have all my limbs  just   i've met loads of new people   and best of all  no one's tried to fuck my mum yet     she's fit    she is fit   don't have a wank over my mum   and unlike my old school  there were girls here   and if there's one thing i now know about girls   and let's face it  there is only one thing i now know about girls   it's that boys who drive are more attractive than those who don't     careful      as he was the oldest   our chances of getting a car to impress the ladies  rested on simon's shoulders   gently does it   and his stupid  uncoordinated size 10 feet   careful   little bit more     i'm just not great at parallel parking   bollocks   shut up   si  it's me nan  she wants to know if you want some help parking   steady on  boys  it's not easy for simon   ok  let's try again   oh  shit   ok  off we go  simon  into first     shouldn't you leave a note    no  we're driving off   quickly now  drive   drive   so it looked like it might be quite some time  before we were picking up girls in a car   jay  i have just had the best lesson ever   jack stephens dropped his ruler next to miss timms  and when she bent over to pick it up  i saw loads of leg on the way down    and a bit of tit on the way up    you lucky git   oh yeah  and it's all locked away up here in the visual wank bank   i thought you'd passed your written test   i did  i've got the practical tomorrow  i thought this might give me a few tips   i don't think there is a section on how not to be a whining little bitch     brilliant    if you pass     we could go on a road trip    could do   maybe we could see what carli's doing and go somewhere with her   a car is like a mobile pulling machine   forget about carli  forget about all the girls at this school   there's a whole world of pussy out there   he's right  although he expressed it like a terrible misogynist     thank you    why don't you come to thorpe park     there's always loads of birds there    oh  my god  yes  thorpe park   i can get you free tickets     how    i work there     mopping up sick    some sick   how come you never mentioned you work at thorpe park before   i worked at asda and you never asked about that     your old man needs the money    he doesn't  actually   but paying for rent boys can't be cheap     my dad's not bent    why's he paying for rent boys     he's not    what  they give him freebies    i think we should lay off neil a bit  is it right  neil  that thorpe park  has one of only two pulley launched coasters outside north america     i don't know    it is right     i don't know if my dad'll let me go    what's it got to do with your dad   he's paying for my car  he might not let me do long journeys yet   surely he'll want you to get sucked off by a little lovely    on the teacup ride    are there really loads of girls there   sometimes on the rides  their boobs pop out   you only get a split second of tit  cos they're going at about 70mph     but it's still good  though    this is perfect   simon passes his test  drives us to thorpe park   neil gets us freebies  and i get to ride       a man's cock in the bushes    the nemesis inferno     this is gonna be awesome    if i pass my test   roller coasters and tits  this is gonna be brilliant   if i pass my test   despite our excitement   we knew it would take a miracle for simon to pass his test   but miracles often come in unlikely packages   hello  simon   i'm tracy  your examiner for today's test   don't look so nervous  i'm not gonna eat you   so  how are you feeling  ready to be    examined     i'm a bit nervous    it's perfectly natural  sweetheart   we just need to loosen you up   ease into it   now  the first part of the test is a doddle   all you've got to do is sing out the registration plate of that blue car   ok  it's     it's  um  e o s     no  5 1  c u  z    shit  it's a v not a u  isn't it    well  technically yes  but     you get a pass on that one for having such pretty eyes   right  to the batmobile  robin     sorry    off you pop to your car   nice   why don't you just let me help you with that   so  simon  have you got a girlfriend     is this part of the test    no   but i will fail you if you say yes   right  just slip it into first and pull out of the centre slowly   shit  i stalled it   false start  just relax  try again     oh  you're shaking    i've failed  haven't i   shush  shush  silly  no one's gonna fail here   right  i'm not sure that's helping with the nerves  actually   simon  if you don't want my help  you've only to say   but trust me  i know how difficult this test can be   good boy   you steer  and i'll do the pedals   that's the tricky bit   simon never did tell us what happened on his driving test   i passed   i passed  first time   so you owe me that  you little shit     i didn't shake on it    a bet's a bet  unlucky   well done  simon  we knew you'd pass   your dad's just bringing round your new car     god  mum  this is brilliant    that is not fair     you're not allowed to touch it    well  we're very proud of you   it's a fiat or something  but he says it is second hand   god  mum  that doesn't matter  this is so cool   that is the gayest car i've ever seen   oh  no     dad    really   really   it might not look much  but it's a great little runner   and you won't be able to kill yourself     i don't want it    come on  it's a special edition   a hawaii   i bet your mates at school will think it's cool     i can't go to school in it    well  if i was a girl   i'd think whoever drove this was pretty trendy   are you trying to wind me up  why are you saying these things   well  i think you should just be a bit more grateful  to be honest     christ  it's got a tape deck    see  that's good   no  it's not  you can't even buy tapes any more   you're being melodramatic again   now  why don't you go and show will  i bet he'll be jealous   he'll be really jealous of how yellow it is   and be careful  that's the most valuable present you'll ever get     i fucking hope not    i heard that   the good news was that simon had passed   the not so good news was bright yellow and parked in my driveway   well  i don't think it's too bad  it's not great  though  is it   no  but don't look at the external realities     think of the immense possibilities    what   yes  it's a cinquecento hawaii  but it's also freedom   it's the possibility of driving our own destiny   we can be what we want now   push our lives literally in the direction we want them to       is that a tape deck    check out the bendermobile   it looks like a paedo's car   he's just jealous cos his family haven't discovered fire yet     you fucking what  mackenzie    nothing  nothing     oh  hello  mrs mackenzie    hello  mark  is this your car   no  it's cooper's     shame about the colour  simon    right     mum  we're just off to thorpe park and we're running a bit late    so we should probably go now    thorpe park     to ride roller coasters  is it safe    yes  it's incredibly safe   won't you be frightened  you cried when you went on the ghost train   i was five years old  mum  please     i just worry about you  petal  actually  i should get you a jumper   go  just drive before she gets back   simon's dad needn't have worried   there was no danger of him getting up enough speed to kill himself   despite the fact thorpe park would be shutting in a few hours     where's your new car  si    round here   fuck me   do you get a free barbie when you buy one of these     shotgun    after you   i called shotgun   what   shotgun  it means i get the front seat   in what way could it possibly mean that     it just does    look   we drove over here with me in the front seat   we've come to pick you up  we've picked you up   now in you get and i'll return to my previous position   it's not happening  freak  i called shotgun     he's right  he did call it    what     you're backing him    get in the back  will   all right  i'm getting in  get off  i'm hyperreflexic  my bones'll pop out   so we had a car   it was a shit car  but it was still a car   all we needed now was some girls   up ahead  a car full of muff  pull alongside 'em  si   i can't  i'm not turning left     it's against the highway code    well  just beep 'em     don't be such a pussy    no  get off   all right  all right     hello  lovelies  follow 'em    all right  i suppose     shit  i stalled it    oh  you dickhead     they're getting away    jesus   you make it sound like we're about to attack them     you lost the muff wagon    what were we gonna do anyway   follow them until they're forced to drive to a police station   they love it  you tool  it's called flirting   yeah  a terrifying and unsolicited form of flirting   if you didn't drive like an old woman  we might catch up with them   i'm not gonna risk our necks for some random girls   well  i'd give a left bollock for 'em  so get a fucking move on   actually  i think that's them up ahead   we've caught up with them  do a left   what are you doing  pull out     there's a space  you can go now    no  it's not safe   are you winding me up  look  go now   thorpe park's gonna be closing soon  si   look  fuck off  all right   i've just passed my test and i'm not gonna crash    cos you twats can't wait two minutes    just fucking go     there's a gap  quickly    all right  for fuck's sake     oh  shit    now look what you've made me do   oh  god   why are they going so fucking slowly   i mean  it's almost as if they don't want to see  their dearly departed fly out the back onto the a320   oh  god   it wasn't a great start to our first road trip  and knowing our luck  they'd be burying him at thorpe park   it's fair to say overtaking dead bodies wasn't simon's strong point   by the time we finally got to thorpe park   we only had two hours of valuable roller coaster time left   i can't believe you lost the muff  you bell end     they were giving us the come on    by driving away as fast as possible   they wanted us to chase 'em   but it's hard to have a chase when you don't go over 30   it's 30 for a reason   i think we should remember today is about roller coasters   and simon's got us here safely   i thought it was about me passing my test   yes    as well   but mainly it's about nemesis inferno   no  today's about tits     and we are in luck  get 'em    right   park it     quickly  you dickhead    fuck off   i'm not waiting any longer   oh  no     oh  shit    oh  dear   your dad's not gonna be pleased  is he   god  look what you've done  christ  i've only had it a day   you're in the shit     where you going    my dad's gonna go mental     i've gotta get this fixed    but the roller coasters     i don't care  i have to get this fixed   but simon  we've come so far   neil's sister's boyfriend is a mechanic  he'll fix it     is he    well  there you go  then   we'll go and find neil  his sister's boyfriend will fix it  and your dad will be none the wiser  as we've travelled all this way     we might as well enjoy the rides    but my car     simon  look at me  look at me   i guarantee the nemesis inferno will cheer you up   or think about them lovelies   they're in there with their    tits and that   come on  let's go and find neil for you     can't we just phone him    he's at work  si   he can't take personal calls   we're gonna have to go in there if we want to talk to him   but what about my car door  what if someone nicks it   we'll take it with us  they'll definitely have a place to store it   fine  for fuck's sake   we have baby changing and disabled access for limited rides   right     not really what i asked   we don't have anywhere to store car doors   turns out they don't have anywhere to store car doors   knew it  fine  we'll take turns carrying it  then     i'm not carrying it    fuck not carrying it     you're paying for it as well  mate    me  why     cos you ripped it off    you reversed     but you're the one who ripped it off    hey  let's not argue   let's just get in there  have some fun   face it  if you could park properly  this wouldn't have happened   yeah  well  i'm the only one who can drive  so you can fuck off   i can drive  i took an army driving course when i was 10   you still wet the bed when you were 10   i wet your mum's bed  with my spunk   yeah  brilliant   when we got into the park   i realised it had been worth ruining a dignified man's funeral for   it was amazing   we may have lost the    hm    tits   but the roller coaster was still in our sights   we had to find neil   if only to stop simon bitching about his car     i'm not paying for it    yes  you are     good luck with that    let's just find neil   what's that   are you all right  mr monkey     it hurts    does he need help   help  help   not up my nose  not my nose     he's gone mental    poor fucker     a wasp  wasp    neil   wasp  in me costume   oh god  that hurts   stupid bloody wasps   neil  i need to speak to you about your sister's boyfriend     oh  jesus  neil    christ  you're naked under there   i don't think it's a good idea to be naked if you're working with kids   but mr monkey isn't naked  he's got a waistcoat and a hat   no  not mr monkey  neil  you     but i'm in the suit    yes  naked   look  i'm in agony here  put some of that cream on my stings     god  all right  then    the worst ones are on my back     and arse    fuck that   you lot can stay here and finger neil's arse if you wanna   but i'm off to find the clunge   neil  seriously  can you put it away  so we can talk     put some clothes on    all right  all right   oh  not again     what    they're always doing   they're bonkers  they've nicked my clothes     where would they have put 'em    i don't know   last time this happened  they burnt 'em   please hurry up  we can't go on the roller coaster if you're naked   don't worry  i'll get something  with the stench from neil's arse still hot in my nostrils   we headed for nemesis   though technically dressed   the clothes neil had picked   made him look surprisingly like a brazilian male prostitute   i've just seen the clunge head towards nemesis   sounds like they're thrill seekers too   i hope they're cock seekers too     brilliant    see ya   i seriously need to speak to you about my car   your sister's boyfriend works in a garage  doesn't he     yeah    will he be working tonight     probably  he works most evenings    brilliant  perfect  that's sorted   the park's about to close so we'll go on nemesis now  and we can deal with the car later  but we'll go on the nemesis now   i suppose so   hello   yes  i got your text   yes  i'm safe   no  i'm not crying   so far  the only terrifying experience i'd had all day  was seeing neil's cock and balls   but now the nemesis inferno was tantalisingly close   this is your last chance to queue for nemesis inferno   the ride is now closing     shit  still an hour queue    that's nothing   i once waited three hours for the indiana jones ride at disneyland paris     you are mental    mental     why is enjoying things mental    this place is full of muff   but you're only interested in roller coasters   girls are everywhere  jay   the best rides in the country are only here     you sound like you're 40    well  i'm queuing   and i'm getting in a separate queue for the front four seats     the front's the best    the ride is now closing     si  are you coming    are you sure your sister's boyfriend    will be working tonight  neil    i told you he works evenings   well  that's sorted  then  now  can we please get on the ride     shotgun the outside seats    no  you can't shotgun this   well  i just did   oh  yes   you know this is one of the only two versions of this roller coaster  outside of the us   and i promise  athough it's taken a little bit longer       half a fucking hour longer    to queue for the front   it will be worth it  unencumbered thrills   and we can come back all year thanks to neil     come on  we're up    room for one more at the front     sorry    one more at the front   how can there possibly be room for only one more at the front   there's three people on the front so there's a spare seat there   let's just rewind a bit  shall we   why are there now 3 people at the front     if you could just get on    they've pushed in   we spent over an hour queuing for the front and they've pushed in   get them off   get them off and make them move  fucking pushing in   it doesn't matter  we'll sit at the back   are they so dumb  they think it's ok to push in  make them move   shut up  you plum  and get on the ride   sir  it's the last ride of the day  please get on   will  honestly  it doesn't matter  just get on   fine  fucking fine  i'll just get on  i'll just get on  and sit at the front next to these inconsiderate arseholes   i'm the worst human being in the world   when i look back on my life   i'm pretty sure that ride will be a low point   but with a bit of luck  the others wouldn't find out who i'd insulted   they were on the front   oh  no  will   oh  my god     will      oh  my god     don't     arseholes      this is the best    you're going to hell   please don't   so i'd finally got to ride the nemesis   which wasn't as much fun as i'd hoped   it would be a long journey home   made longer by simon carrying the door  and my heavy sense of shame   well  it can't be too hard to find  it's the colour of my nan's piss     why are you watching your nan piss    what am i gonna say to my parents     will the door go back on    stop shitting yourself   neil said his sister's boyfriend will be able to fix it     no  he won't be able to fix that    what   you said he'd be able to fix it no problem and he worked in a garage   he does  bp garage  he mucks about with cars   but he won't be able to fix that in a million years   the door's come off   this is a disaster  my dad's gonna go mad   it'll be fine  we'll find someone else to fix it   i know a bloke who builds formula one cars  he owes me a favour   i don't think your make believe friend will fix this   we'll find a proper mechanic on the way back  it can't be too hard   as long as it's fixed good as new and my parents don't know   that's all i care about   oh look  here it is  car park d   oh  dear   what the fuck has happened     holy shit  what's happened    at least they left the tape deck   i don't believe this  there's no explaining this to my dad   i mean  who and why     yes  that makes sense    fuckers  let's get 'em   jay  i'm not gonna chase after and then fight the happy foundation bus   how are we getting home  then   it's true   girls do like cars   they just don't like shitty little yellow cars  that ruin funerals and don't have all the doors they were made with   girls are also less keen on boys who wear speedos   borderline sex pests  and people who insult the disabled  inconsiderate arseholes   but it's not all bad   what we learned today is there isn't a car on the planet  that can make us cool  whatever state it was in   dad    what you need to know is it wasn't my fault   well  i'm sorry  but it wasn't my fault   transcript  evarin   synchro  tagne
