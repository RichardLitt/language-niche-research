 oh  for god's sake   can you put that down  please  can you  you've picked up a hearse and we're trying to bury somebody   toilet flushes  oh  hello  mrs vicarage   i've  erm  i've made a brew if you fancy   erm  how did you get in  colin   your back door was open  you want to watch that   there's none left  oh  i'll make another pot  oh  ta   also  you're out of milk and bread  and them nice cornflakes with all the nuts and gubbins on   sorry  colin  why are you here   i just wanted to make sure that adam got to prayers on time today   because he was late last week  which was bad of him   well  it's been shitting kittens out there  so i thought i'd pop in for a brew   yes  as i said to 15 of your colleagues yesterday  what sort of council clamps a hearse   no  i don't want to look on your website   colin  hello  yeah  i was just saying that your back door was open  so i thought i'd make alex a cuppa   oh  ok  that's nice of you   colin  if you're coming to morning prayer  we should go soon   yeah  i should get on  now i've had my morning dump   i'll just get your blanket off the couch   did he sleep here   no  i don't think so  did he   i'll ask him  but where's all the bread   it's in colin's tummy with my cornflakes   oh  now i'm going to see faiza at the office today so can i say yes   she can use the church for her koran classes  remind me  i told you   she wants to use your church for her children's koranic classes   they've lost the community centre they were using  so     and she's happy to use a church to teach the koran   yes  faiza's happy  are you happy   yes  i am  obviously   erm  i just worry about other people  like colin  with prejudices   what prejudices have i got   i haven't got any  apart from hating man city   what do you think about muslims  colin   erm  i like the idea of having loads of wives   that's one of theirs  isn't it   they wear all those black sheets  don't they  the women   the burka  yes  some of them do  colin  a minority  i think   they look like  erm     religious ninjas   do you think they're sexy under there   i think the whole point of wearing them  colin  is probably to avoid exactly that question   i think it makes them mysterious  which is sexy   right  well can i suggest you avoid saying that to them  ok  because they might be offended   i'm only a partial fan of explicit nudity   i tell you what the burka is good for  though   armed robbery   scouse tony's got three mates who done the paddy betting shop on park street   they dressed entirely in those sheets  but with shotguns underneath   you've got to question why a bookie thought three fat muslim women  wanted to put some money on the 4 15 at chepstow   maybe you should do a call to prayers  vicarage  like muslims   you could stand outside and go  hi da    be quiet now  please  colin  let's say a christian prayer instead   oh  lord  open our lips   and our mouths shall proclaim your praise   glory be to god and the holy son    i got dripped on   i'm getting dripped on   i'm also experiencing a little dampness   it's china  is it   yes  there's a lead theft epidemic going on because of the demand from china   our insurers had to pay out nine million last year  would you believe   it seems likely this gang were interrupted  we've only lost some of our roof  thankfully   well  if you do decide to make a claim with our insurers  i'm afraid you're going to have to  join the queue  they've even hit the mine shaft in town  what's that   it's a men's day spa on bond street   what's wrong with the world where people are actually prepared to steal from a church   or a good day spa  i know   since you're here  archdeacon  i wanted you to know that i've  decided to let a muslim children's group use the church on saturdays   ooh  how exciting you are  yes  why have you done it   erm  it's something i've been keen to do for a while   there's a flourishing muslim community here  and i've wanted to engage in  erm  an interfaith dialogue   i feel there's a forest of prejudice out there   a forest  are you sure about that  adam   of course i do see a few shrubberies of prejudice here  and there  or perhaps you think i'm hiding in my log cabin of denial   will they pay   yes  fine  good   get as much off them as you can   i'm sure you'll have a lovely time   in my experience  muslims like men in cassocks  they can relate   ooh  i'm all dizzy now  oh   archdeacon robert  if you ever have any spare time i would love to talk to you  about corinthians 7 and whether you think an unbeliever is sanctified by marriage to a believer   i never have any spare time  nigel   colin  what are you doing up there  i'm going to do an armed vigil  in case the thieves return   if those bastards come back  they'll have to get past me     and my shovel of justice   you're going to let muslims use the church  isn't that very incendiary of you  adam   no  it might be a hot bed for radicals   don't be stupid  nigel  that's just ignorant   these are prayer classes for children   i don't think that but i think some other people might think it   some other people like you   my nephew tony  he says that muslims are terrorists who want to bring down western civilisation   he's in the army   well  i'm sure if you're on active service in afghanistan that might well feel true   he's in aldershot   why can't they go somewhere else  eh   this is the lord's church  it's not harrods   with church numbers in crisis  you are welcoming in the very  people whose expansion threatens our church   no  they don't  faiza is british   if people aren't coming to the church  it's because we're not engaging with the community   it's not because they've all suddenly become muslims   i'm ending this discussion now   why  have you got to get to the mosque    adam  there's something i need to show you   colin has been sleeping in the church   oh  let's clear it up  quick as we can   is that a potty  oh  he's filled it   ok  you do that  i'll do these beer tins   i don't think so  i'll do the beer tins  it's your church   thank you  nigel   mind that dog poo   hello  you must be faiza   yes  you must be reverend smallbone  adam  yes  how lovely to meet you   i'm so pleased you feel you can use the church for these classes   is that a potty you're holding  reverend  yes  it is  it's not mine   let me just dump it   erm  nigel  this is faiza   i'm so pleased you feel able to use our church for this  we don't have a problem with it at all   yes  well  we did worry that you might think we'd all turn out to be fundamentalists in niqabs   trying to radicalise our children and teach them to build bombs and destroy the west   they laugh guiltily  no  of course not  we didn't think that   i'm from suffolk   well  anyway     hello  come in  come in   this our teacher today  khadijah   hello  pleased to meet you   well  erm  there's a classroom area which we've assembled over here   if you'd like to go and see  i hope you find it's appropriate to your requirements   ah  now  come away from that  you leave that alone   wait till lunch   girl reads in arabic  perfect  now you try   look how comfortable they are with their religion   it's because islam's so woven into their every day lives  whereas for  our lot it's just something you do on sundays if you can be bothered   christian kids are all in the pub taking drugs cos  that's more fun than listening to one of your sermons   ha ha  nigel   maybe if other people had a grasp of these values  our roof wouldn't be halfway to beijing   thank you for coming  faiza  it was a real privilege to be part of this   it was inspiring   al hamdu lillah   there is a great history of christians helping out muslims  of course   yes  and we'd be very wise not to forget that   i'm not sure that's an appropriate magazine to have in a church  is it  reverend  with little ones around   no  of course not  it's not mine   obviously  it belongs to a man called colin  who's left it   i'm sorry  it must be very offensive to you as a muslim  well to you as  a woman anyway  of course  but obviously additionally also offensive to you as a muslim woman   one of my uncles earns a packet selling magazines like that in his shop   does he  good  i mean  erm     yes  but we are taught to believe that it's wrong for women to use their bodies for personal gain   yes  i quite agree  i think so too   i certainly don't allow things like that in my church   adam  if you want to borrow me jazz mag  just ask   hello  love   now  any questions about the story i was telling you last week   how come's mary was a virgin when she gave birth  sir   well  that's what's so miraculous and marvellous about it   does that mean god did it to her  sir   sir  sir  what's a virgin  are you a virgin  sir   no  no  i'm not  is miss your girlfriend  sir  thank you  ewan  that's enough   is there a competition today to be britain's most obnoxious child   do you fancy miss  sir  no  he does not  ewan and chloe  stay behind after assembly  please   he does  you do  sir  don't you  sir   no  i do not fancy miss pattman and i will not have her disrespected in this way   sex  whether it is between me and miss pattman  or anyone else  is a beautiful thing and should not be mocked like this   we weren't like that when we were 11  were we   i wasn't  i suspect you might have been   they're all inappropriately sexualised for their age   yes  but how you spoke to chloe isn't really acceptable  adam   although i was a tiny bit upset you told the whole school that you don't fancy me   oh  look there's a planning notice  what's going on here   oh  it's some bar and restaurant   didn't i mention it at the parent governor's meeting  no  i don't think so   cheeky's gentlemen's bar and grill  is that what i suspect it is   yes  probably  a gentlemen's club for gentlemen   that's a strip club  isn't it  well  i'm sure it's not going to be open during the day   that's not good enough  ellie  a strip club is not appropriate opposite a school   what sort of example does that set your young girls   they certainly shouldn't be encouraged to use their bodies for personal gain   no  not if you put it like that   and you don't want drunk men hanging around outside the school gates with erections   not if they should be inside teaching geography   we're going to join forces and oppose the planning  application because the club is not appropriate in that location   i'm just worried you're going to look judgemental  when you're not   i want to be judgemental for once   i'm fed up with business and money dominating everyone's lives   that's what i'm opposing with this   people look to me for moral judgement  don't they   ellie's asked me to visit one of these clubs with her   oh  right  vicar in a strip club  whose idea was that   doorbell buzzes  her idea  your friend faiza wouldn't put up with it  would she   oh  it's you again   bye  bye  darling   bye   yeah  right  yeah  vicar  see what  it is  yeah  see what it is  yeah  my mum's in hospital in southend   she's had erm  an incident  no  hysterectomy  yeah   poor thing  man   i thought your mum had died   you came here last week  you needed money to identify her body   do you remember   erm  erm  right  yeah  i've run out of petrol and will you give me some money so i can fill this   what  no   well  will you lend me 25 quid then   no  i won't   you've got to  someone's left a mark saying you will   what   see  that means soft touch for cash  yeah   and that means you can buy crack in them flats   i assume you know this  vicar   what does that mean   some kids lost its glove and someone's picked it up and put it on a gate   colin  do you know what some trainers hung over a street lamp indicates   yeah  that means  erm  you can have sex in the church   no  it means drugs   no  it means gay sex with a drug addict in the church  yeah  that's it   get so confused  there's that many different signs   are you going to disapprove of that too   like the prostitutes opposite the school   they're not prostitutes  colin  it's a lap dancing club  and i'm just opposing a planning notice  that's all   those poor girls  smuggled in from exotic places  to sell their fannies for cash just because they want to become lawyers   disgusting   mind you  i do love it when they bend over and wiggle their beautiful bums in your face   sign up against the filth  stop the filth  will you sign our petition to stop the filth   sign up against the filth  stop the filth   stephen  you've got girls at the school  do you want to sign our petition against the proposed  lap dancing club opposite   don't let them rape our children's minds  yes  absolutely   well done  quite right  yeah   i'm glad somebody's making a stand   have a lovely sunday  where is this petition to sign   i will fight against the paedophiles   adoha  it's a petition opposing a bar that might open opposite the school  a bar for paedophiles   no  just a bar and dance club   owned by a paedophile  no  it's owned by an american company  i think   run by paedophiles   i'm sorry to disappoint you  there are no paedophiles  it's just a nightclub   a nightclub   for gentlemen  with naked women   tell me about your campaign   i'm going to write a stiff letter to the bishop  softly  softly is the best approach   adam  we must fight  fight this evil  fight the paedophiles   phone rings  hello    colin   i see  what have you done   ok  sit tight and don't talk to the police until i get there   what's going on  the good new is that colin caught the lead thief at the church   the bad news is that colin caught the lead thief at the church  and he's been arrested for abh    with a wheelie bin  oh   apparently you told him to call me if anything like this ever happened   did i  yes  thanks for that   we don't want to appear to be too forbidding  adam   always goes down very badly  people hate it   it's ok  i know  heaven forbid we ever mention the idea of hell or sin  at church  because it just sends everybody fleeing   i'm fed up with the church in london being like some affable  club that forgives everything and is terrified to take a moral stand   do you take milk  no   although jesus did used to consort with the prostitutes  didn't he   these aren't prostitutes  this is a lap dancing club   i'm striving to build a kingdom on earth  aren't i  isn't that my role   you're striving  are you   where did this striving idea come from  your muslim friends   do you know what the arabic for strive is  adam   jihad   oh  so are you on some sort of sex jihad  adam   no  because god is not opposed to sex   i know  i'm not saying he is   i'm afraid that there's no way the bishop is going to stick his neck out for cheeky girls   he's in enough trouble as it is due to his having tea  with that lesbian bishop  so  please   will you tell nigel to stop writing to him  and bog off   yes   thanks for the coffee   have you even been to one of these clubs  adam  and do you even know what it is you're opposing   actually  i'm going to one tomorrow to find out   are you indeed   with the headmistress  to help her out   it was her idea   is that the lead thief in the bin   yes  that's the  victim   as we now call him   apparently colin slammed it into the wall 19 times before the police turned up   it'll be a miracle if i get him off tomorrow   the magistrate he's got is a dragon   right  good luck with that   and even if i do get him off tomorrow  he's got more  problems because apparently the victim is a member of quite a nasty gang and they know where he lives   dear lord  i haven't got long but can i ask you to offer some protection to colin   i know he's testing  but i'm worried he may be about to get a kicking  from this lead gang and he was only trying to do good  in his own way   and can i thank you for bringing faiza and the muslims into my church   or is it wrong of me to do that   was their arrival down to you   and why was i holding a jazz mag   is this all heresy   i'm not sure  but i found their clear moral values inspiring  and it's given me some sort of certainty for once and i like that feeling   and please give me strength for my trip to cheeky's  and what i'm about to confront   hello  adam   i'm here for our evening of sex and nudity     ain't gonna be nobody's baby       let's not stay too long  ellie   i just need some ammunition for the planning meeting  so i know what level of outrage i can take it up to   yes

of this lead gang   this is the perfect way to hide   no  it's not right  find another way to hide   well  the gang might get me   no  they won't  this is completely   profoundly  distressingly offensive  colin  do something else   grow a beard  wear a hat  get an eye patch   dress like a pirate   i don't care  you can't do this   very pleased alex got you off  though   alex is a genius  isn't she  no wonder you love her   she told that scary woman judge that it would be wrong to fine me because there's no way i'd ever be able to  pay and it'd just cause more chaos  and if they stuck me in prison it'd turn me into a criminal   next time i do something wrong  i'm going to ring alex up straight away   she'll be delighted to hear that  colin   now that the lead thief's been caught  thanks to you   could you move your bed out of the church because it's actually starting to smell   do i have to   i like sleeping here   i have really nice dreams   come on   got any ciggies  colin
