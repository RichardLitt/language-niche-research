their behalf  i would like to cancel my membership  yeah   gyms are not for people like me  they're for people like her  you stretchy freak   please  don't hassle our members  or i'll have to ask you to leave for unsocial behaviour   do you know  i don't know how you sleep at night when all you do is hand out  a towel once every three hours to a piece of lycra carrying a woman       whilst the majority pay for the upkeep  and we may not be  the majority in numbers  but pound for pound there's more of us   yeah  we could get you   ok  maybe not  but we could have a sit on   and i will personally sit on you  and not in a fun way   sorry  do you mind if i just do that   that is lovely   listen  be warned  because i do get what i want  ok  which is why i'm a successful career bitch
