in a land of myth and a time of magic   the destiny of a great kingdom  rests of the shoulders of a young boy   his name   merlin    i understand you have a shield for me   with your swordcraft and this shield  i guarantee you'll win     show me how it works    certainly   thara ymbsittendra ofer hronradehyran scolde   when you're competing in the tournament   you pin your opponent under the shield  a snake strikes     your opponent will be paralysed   the snakes are now under your command   they will do anything that you tell'em to do     anything    just say the word   kill him   knight valiant of the western isles     i'm here for the tournament    welcome to camelot   merlin  ready   would it make any difference if i said no   not really   arthur  body  shield  body  shield  merlin

please   shield  body  shield  shield   braver than you look  most servants collapse after the first blow     is it over    just a warm up   how's your mace work coming along   so   how was your first day as arthur's servant   do you hear clanging   it was horrible   and i've still got to learn about tournament etiquette by the morning   unheran achtun bregdan   oi  what have i told you about using magic like this   if i could actually feel my arms i'd pick up the books myself      what do i do if you get caught   what would you do   well  you just make sure it doesn't happen  for the both our sakes   i save arthur from being killed and i end up as a servant   how is that fair   not sure if fairness comes into it  you never know  it might be fun   you think mucking out arthur's horses is gonna be fun     should hear my list of duties    we all have duties  even arthur   must be tough for him  with all the girls  the glory   he is a future king  people expect so much of him  he's under a lot of pressure   that makes two of us   so you've got voiders on the arms  the hauberk goes over your chest        i guess you know what to do with the helmet   yeah  that was the only bit i'd figured out   how come you're better at this than me   i'm the blacksmith's daughter   i know pretty much all about armour  which is actually kind of sad   no  it's brilliant   you do know the tournament starts today   yes  sire   you nervous   i don't get nervous     really  i thought everyone did    will you shut up     great  i think you're all set    aren't you forgetting something   my sword   oh  yeah  yeah  sorry   guess  uh  you'll be needing that   that went well   uther  knights of the realm   it's a great honour to welcome you to camelot   over the next three days  you will test your bravery  your skills as warriors  and  of course  challenge the reigning champion   my son  prince arthur   only one can have the honour of being crowned champion   and he will receive a prize of 1 000 gold pieces   it is in combat that we learn a knight's true nature   whether he is indeed a warrior or a coward   the tournament begins   i trust you will make me proud   yeah  come on   yeah   knight valiant looks pretty handy with a sword   may i offer my congratulations on your victories today   likewise   hope to see you at the reception this evening   creep   uh  for tomorrow  you need to repair my shield  wash my tunic   clean my boots  sharpen my sword and polish my chain mail     are you using magic again    no   what's all this  then   just came to tell you supper's ready   knight valiant of the western isles  my lord   i saw you fighting today  very aggressive   as my lord said   to lose is to be disgraced    i couldn't agree more   knight valiant  i present the lady morgana  my ward   my lady     i saw you competing today    i saw you watching   i understand the champion escorts my lady to the feast   that's correct   i will give everything to win   my lady     arthur    father   they all seem rather impressed     not the only ones    not jealous  are you   i don't see there's anything to be jealous of   could arthur be any more annoying   i so hope knight valiant wins the tournament     you don't really mean that    yes  i do   hello   is there someone there   can i help you with something  boy   nope  i'm good   i   i was just    um   gathering my master's armour   then you'd best be on your way   right  yeah  no problem     you did all this on your own    yes  sir   let's see if you can get me into it without forgetting anything   that was much better  not that it could have got any worse   i'm a fast learner   i hope for your sake that's true   good luck   is it my imagination or are you beginning to enjoy yourself   it    it isn't totally horrible all the time   yes   strike him   strike him  snake hisses  i think he's badly hurt     how is he    it's most odd   look at this  these two small wounds  looks like a snakebite   how could he have been bitten by a snake   he was injured in the swordfight   the symptoms are consistent with poisoning     slow pulse  fever  paralysis    can you heal him   if it's a bite  i have to extract venom from the snake that bit'im   to make an antidote   if he doesn't get antidote    there's nothing i can do   he's going to die   he was fighting knight valiant     what's that    nothing   dinner time   come on  on valiant's shield come alive   he's using magic   are you sure   the snake ate a mouse   one swallow  straight down   ewan was fighting valiant when he collapsed   it must've been one of the snakes from the shield   i have to tell arthur   is there any chance you might be mistaken     i know magic    perhaps  have you any proof   don't you believe me   you'll land yourself in trouble     how would you explain why you were in valiant's cabin    what does that matter   he's using magic to cheat in the tournament  you can't accuse a knight without proof    the king would never accept the word of a servant over that of a knight   so what i say doesn't count for anything   it counts for very little as fas as the  king's concern  that's the way it is   you telling me you've got to fight that   yes  and he's strong as a bear   but he's slow     ah  and you're fast    exactly   you're not worried  are you   no     how are you getting on    fine    just doing my job   minding my own business   valiant's going to fight arthur in the final   he'll use the shield to kill him   merlin  about what i said yesterday     look  uther really wouldn't listen to you or me   but you are right   we can't let valiant get away with it   but we don't have proof   if we can cure ewan   he could tell the king valiant was using magic   the king would believe another knight   but how we get the antidote  that's another matter   merlin   all  long live valiant   so  valiant  you think you stand a chance of defeating my son   he is a great warrior  my lord  i do hope to be a worthy opponent   you should stay in camelot after the tournament   i could do with more knights like you   i'd be honoured  my lord   i'll get started preparing the antidote     i'm going to tell arthur    you'll need this   and  merlin  what you did was very brave   you   you chopped its head off   ewan was bitten by a snake when he was fighting valiant       you can see the wounds where he was bitten   ewan was winning   he had to cheat   valiant wouldn't dare use magic in camelot   ewan was pinned under the shield   no one could see it bite him   i don't like him but i don't think he's cheating   gaius is preparing an antidote  when ewan's conscious  he'll tell you   if you fight him  he'll use the shield so he can beat you   look at it  have you seen snakes like this in camelot   i know i'm just a servant  and my word doesn't count for anything   i wouldn't lie to you   i want you to swear to me what you're telling me is true   i swear it's true   then i believe you   welcome back   there was a snake on his shield     it came alive    you're weak    the snake's venom is still in your system   i must warn arthur   arthur knows  he's requested an audience with the king   they'll want to talk to you  rest  you'll need your strength   i need to fetch more herbs  i'll be back   why have you summoned the court   i believe knight valiant is using a magic shield  to cheat in the tournament     what do you have to say to this    my lord this is ridiculous  i've never used magic   does your son have any evidence to support this outrageous accusation     do you have evidence    i do   i'm afraid this potion tastes like toad water  but it'll get you back on your feet   ewan   let me see this shield   don't let him get too close   be careful  my lord     we need ewan  find out what's happening   as you can see my lord it's an ordinary shield   he's not gonna let everyone see this things come alive   how do i know what you say is true   i have a witness   knight ewan was bitten by a snake from the shield   its venom made him grievously ill  however  he's received an antidote   he will confirm that knight valiant is using magic   where is this witness   he should be here   where's ewan   he's dead   i'm waiting   i'm afraid the witness is dead   so you have no proof to support these allegations   have you seen valiant use magic   no   but my servant fought     your servant   you make these outrageous accusations against a knight  on the word of your servant   i believe he tells the truth   am i really to be judged on hearsay from a boy     i've seen those snakes come alive    how dare you interrupt    guards     my lord      wait   i'm sure he was merely mistaken   i wouldn't want him punished on my account   you see  this is how a true knight behaves   with gallantry and honour   my lord  if your son made these accusations  because he's afraid to fight me   then i will graciously accept his withdrawal   is this true   do you wish to withdraw from the tournament   no   what am i to make of these allegations   obviously there has been a misunderstanding   i withdraw the allegation against knight valiant   please accept my apology   accepted   i believed you  i trusted you   and you made me look a complete fool   i know it didn't go to plan      didn't go to plan     my father and the entire royal court think i'm a coward   you humiliated me   we can still expose valiant   i no longer require your services     you're sacking me    i need a servant i can trust   you can trust me   got me nowhere  get out of my sight   where are you    i just came to tell you    whatever you think my destiny is   whatever it is you think i'm supposed to do   you've got the wrong person   that's it   goodbye   dragon  if only it were so easy to escape one's destiny   how can it be my destiny to protect someone who hates me   a half cannot truly hate that which makes it whole   very soon you shall learn that   oh  great just what i needed   another riddle   that your and arthur's path lies together is but the truth   what is that supposed to mean   you know  young warlock  this is not the end   it is the beginning   just give me a straight answer   hello  merlin   all right   is it true about valiant using magic   what are you gonna do   why does everyone think it's down to me   because it is      isn't it   you have to show everyone you were right and they were wrong   and how do i do that   i don't know     where are you going   do you have a wheelbarrow   what are you doing with that   letting everyone see the snakes for themselves    bebay odothay    bebay odothay arisan quickum    bebay odothay arisan quickum   bebay odothay arisan quickum   bebay odothay arisan quickum     bebay odothay arisan quickum   i

 the people expect me to fight   how can i lead men in battle if they think i'm a coward   valiant will kill you  if you fight  you die   then i die   how can you go out there and fight like that   because i have to   it's my duty   bebay odothay       arisan quickum   let me   i used to help my father with his armour   thanks   arthur   be careful   see you at the feast   bebay odothay arisan
