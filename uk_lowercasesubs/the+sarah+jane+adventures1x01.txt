'my name's maria jackson  and this is bannerman road   'i've just moved in with my dad after he and my mum got divorced '  oh  right  on the brush   you've got some on your face  there  just there   then  in this big old house over the road   i met sarah jane smith   she's a journalist     who investigates aliens   that's luke  born yesterday  near enough   sarah jane's adopted him  and together  we saved the world   i discovered that life was so much bigger and stranger and better  than i ever thought possible   oi  thank you  don't do anything i wouldn't do   but when school began  i thought things might go back to normal   i was wrong   they just got weirder       and weirder       and weirder   wahhhh    now  you take care  ok   goodbye  mum  oh  i don't think so   no  sarah jane's just fine   oh  hi  maria   children laugh  why were they laughing   first day  and your mum's kissing you goodbye  is that bad   bit embarrassing  plus  she so wants you to call her mum   she said she didn't  it's not what she said   that's a bit flashy  it's a brand new building   there was an article about it in the paper  wonder what's inside it   not them  scan along   where is he   there  him   he's not that big  how will i fit   he'll do  get yourself ready   i'll go fetch   what can i do for you  stand right there  tim   any particular reason   very particular  he breaks wind oops   happens to us all   and i'll need those  sorry   waaaaahhhhh   i'm feeling anxious  so am i   but you've been to school before   not this one  budge up   you new today  yeah  maria   clyde  new too  probably hang around with you  till i meet some cooler people  how do you do  i'm luke smith   ok  that was a joke  now i mean it   good morning everybody  all  good morning  mr blakeman   he breaks wind  everyone laughs  what's funny  the wife gave me cabbage and bean tartlets last night   yet another reason to despise jamie oliver   welcome back everybody  it's a new year  hope you all do well   don't run in the courtyard  don't even think of wearing make up  and study hard   because i guarantee none of you are gonna be pop stars   what's his problem   so     what else  he breaks wind  oh  yeah   what a bright future you've all got  children of the world   etcetera  right     as you've seen  we have a new technology block   i'll be taking you over in groups to look at our amazing new facilities   starting with   form 10b   there are 16 classrooms with broadband connections   but anything dubious your adolescent minds may be drawn to   i've locked out   i've signed us up for this  first meeting's tomorrow   lunchtime science club  and now i'm backing away   he breaks wind shut up   why is farting funny   it just is  but it's a normal process of the human bowel   are you for real   smells weird in here  farts   dunno   metal  electric   like batteries   can i sit here  only if i'm not gonna shame you   well  i either sit here with you or sit there with that   what  there's someone worse than me  just   so where are you from  hounslow  my parents split up   so i moved here with mum  like me  only i moved with my dad   yeah  how's that  better than them rowing all the time  yeah   ow   what's wrong with that  it's mouldy   what kind of slop are they serving here   is it leftovers from last term or something   sir  sir  what   how am i meant to eat that   just pick the bad bits off   great  that leaves me with a pea   mine's off too  that is disgusting  what's wrong with this place   it stinks  the food's rotten  something weird's going on here   goodbye  repellent pubescents   until tomorrow  this skin    it's killing me round the legs   right  time for a test run   now  what about the caretaker   i've taken care of the caretaker   everything's ready  come on   oh  i see  you've cadged a lift  have you   i offered  i dunno  lady muck  getting the neighbours  to chauffeur her around  shut up  dad  how was the first day  then   ok  a bit weird  though  the headmaster keeps farting   really  what  noisy smelly ones or silent but deadlies  eugh  what   place stinks like batteries  and the food was off   i'll make you a proper tea   you go and get changed  bye  see you  maria   i want a proper tea too   make it yourself  i'm not your cook   whatever  no  forget it  it's all right  we'll phone out for a curry   can't have you straining yourself after your long voyage home  can we   you think you're so funny  yeah   how do you get like that  you and maria   always been like that  don't really think about it   anyway  the school can't be that bad  they've just built this   someone donated the money and this technology block was put up   looks incredible  hold on  i did an it job in a school  in a new block  that looks like that  was it built by coldfire construction   yeah  where  on the other side of town  st sheldon's  in upminster   that place smelt odd  sort of metallic   anyway  better go   stop her ordering the entire menu  bye   systems online   that's it  now  synchronise the mega wattage  synchronizing mega     watty   er     that one   kept making social mistakes today  i think i made one too   driving to school when it's round the corner  kissing you goodbye   oh  we're both new hands at this   i don't know anyone except maria and clyde   maria's in different classes to me most of the time   and clyde thinks i'm uncool  clyde's not the only kid in the school   what if i make more mistakes  never make the same ones again   listen  anyone is nervous starting a new school  a new job   i've never been a mum before  do i have to go   i could take you out  teach you here  i considered it   but you  luke smith  you're going to live a normal life   as normal a life as i can give you   what if i get it wrong again  it makes me feel   stupid   remember  you saved the world the day you were born   not many people can say that   no one else can say that  that's the problem  nobody else is like me   what are you doing  checking up on the firm who built your new block   coldfire construction   they started expanding 18 months ago  contracts all round the world   some odd things cropping up   now they're putting up school buildings all round london   makes a change for me   not aliens  is it   stabilising     there   aaah   only me  come for a gawp   alan  this is really kind of all right   thanks  chrissie  i really value your opinion  don't be sarky   is maria upstairs  i think it went ok for her today   what went ok for her today  her first day at the new school  today   my mind's just been all over the place   stress like you would not believe   so why did you come round  to see my daughter  do i need another reason   oh  while i think about it   you were gonna give me that 13 5 tog double duvet   only you don't need it  you've got the single   maria  love  it's your mum   lights out  london   school can't be that bad   i mean  like i said  it's a much better catchment area   ooh  got to go  love  ivan's taking me to the pub  it's opera night   the waiters sing while you're eating   oh  great  there's a torch   with a flat battery  i'm not saying anything  i'll get the candles   power cut  yes  mr smith's not responding   the computer just went pffft  and guess who forgot to save her work   i'll just see how long it'll be  i can check the local power grid   that's impossible  it never loses power  can't lose power   there we go  goes as far as i can see   happened all the time when i was a kid   it once went off right in the middle of manimal  i was distraught   weird  why's that happening   give them to me  i can do it  no  i'll do it   what was that  it's destabilising hell   turn it off  turn it off  turn it off   what   weird  must be faulty   or the same thing that cut the electric off cut this off   fantastic every station in the loop is working   but the stabiliser cuts out   i'll fix it  you bought those plans off that wallarian   you took his word it worked  i'll sort out the storage problem   then it'll stabilise  ok  until then i'm stuck here  in this   teaching science on the planet thick  where they still haven't worked out string theory  ooh  it chafes   oh  shut up  don't you get it   we're nearly there  one more step     and we destroy this planet   science is my first class today   lab 2a  with mr jeffrey   you'll be fine   see you  then   oh  hi   oh  not interrupting  no  no  no   just making a start  had a bigger garden in the old house   do you miss it  yeah  well  needs must and all that   shame  i had a lot of plans for that old garden   just didn't plan on my wife running off with a judo instructor   you ever been married  no  never found time   wise move  anyway   sorry  oh  i was just wondering   that school you mentioned in upminster  st sheldon's   i'm sure i've still got the plans here somewhere   yeah  there we go   cost a fortune  they had broadband installed  the works   where did the money come from  i dunno  private funding   what sort of journalist are you  oh  local stories  nothing exciting   maria was saying you'd travelled a fair bit  could say that  yeah   what's that bit  it's blank   never went in  coldfire kept that to themselves  it was sealed off   there's no door  you reckon they're hiding something  do you   ooh  something mysterious inside a school   that would be ridiculous  a bit  do you mind if i keep this  no   a transformer is an electrical device  that changes the voltage of the ac supply   such as your     our mains electrical supply   anybody know who invented the first transformer    you   faraday  correct  though he didn't know what to use it for  what   i've thought about it too  you could get rid of the transformers   get a better system and induct power instead   just pointing out  i'm nothing to do with him  quiet   name  clyde langer   troublemaker  noted   ok   you're cool because you make trouble  should i make trouble   i hear talking   run out  i'm getting a new one   let me see that   oh  what is it  cold chip sandwich   made it this morning  not chancing my life in that canteen again   oi  you can't do that   you can wait until lunchtime and use the canteen like everybody else   i'll report you for that  go on  try it   he breaks wind  pupils laugh  bell rings  right  for tomorrow    hopeless  miss smith  even worse this term   i believe you had the wiring in your new block re installed   keep crashing  and look   look at this   fresh this morning  everything goes off   and there's that smell  like batteries   and it started when you got your new technology block   hasn't anyone tried to work out what's wrong   a parent governor raised it at our meeting  and   fell off his bike the next morning  three months in traction   can't you feel it  miss smith   like   a thunderstorm's coming   hello  miss smith  she laughs  incredible knowledge   this child  luke smith  is a freak  you really think he can help us   yes  we'll use him to solve the storage problem   a 14 year old human  something's strange about him  these kids stink   acne and grease and coats and crisps  but he smells   fresh   when can you get to him  very soon   we have a rendezvous   welcome to lunchtime science club   i had hoped for a slightly higher turnout  but never mind   there's only me   and me  carl   luke  pleased to meet you   hi  carl's the science star of the school  supposedly   though i imagine he's probably pretty rubbish compared to you   take a look at this  now  over the summer i've been having tons of fun  working on a new project   what do you make of this   um    it's a model for a giant capacitor system   purely theoretical   nobody could possibly build this for real   you designed this  yes  i'm wasted here   do you like it  it's amazing  let me see   now  i have a problem   my purely theoretical problem is     anyone  don't tell me   oh  yeah  with this  you could store huge amounts of electrical energy   but there's a loophole   here in the storage  it wouldn't stabilise   that's my problem  well done  gold star   no star  you went wrong here   you need to add an equation into the computer control   yeah   i'll take your word for it   the power stabilises  your problems are over  yes  all my problems are     i don't know about yours  though   and that school has exactly the same problem as yours   so i'm off to coldfire construction   do you want me to do anything  yeah   have a look round  see if you can find where that smell's coming from   ok  see you later  good luck   who was that  then  nobody   result   yes  that's it   and he just handed it over   hilarious  humans     even the clever ones are stupid   at last  we will be avenged   we'll finish this planet tonight   someone looks happy  i had double maths this afternoon   science club was brilliant  mr jeffrey's really nice   i think we'll be friends  you don't make friends with a teacher   why not  you just don't  anyway  sarah jane phoned   she wants us to look inside the new block   what are you doing  investigating the new block   i left something in the new block  what is it with you and her   i've seen weird people  i know weird people   but you two  you're beyond weird  go find some normal people then   can i help you   that's not right   i want answers  where are you from   doesn't make any sense   but where've you been all your life  you don't know farting's funny   you let your mum kiss you in public  where was your last school   i've never been to school  your mum taught you at home  no   and she isn't my mum  there are 16 classrooms in this building  hold on   what's sarah jane to you  she adopted me   why don't you call her mum  she doesn't want me to   what about your real mum and dad  i haven't got a mum or dad   everybody's got a mum and dad  i have a dad   somewhere   this block measures about  so double that for both floors     the area of each room doesn't add up to that   so there's an empty space    through there   i think you should go home   so what are you saying about our company then  miss      oh  you can call me janine   janine   i've been reading up  it's not just these school projects in london   you've moved from country to country  hiring cheap local labour   yes  at your building in santiago  workers refuse to go in   food goes off  endless technical problems   valencia  paris  the same story  and another thing   the plans for each building have a large empty area behind a wall   why is that   there's another room  a secret room  behind there   i'll tell you this    but how do you get inside  i'm not getting through   stop   being   strange   who's that   i know you're in here     i can smell you   he sniffs  ah  a little girl   fresh as a daisy   sugar and spice and all things nice   she really shouldn't be hanging around school after home time   not when i've got no reason to hide in this stupid skin any longer   squeaking  because these projects are so far apart  nobody connects them   i strongly advise you to leave right now   if you know what's good for you   is that a threat  yes   what   after all     why should i hide   that was your last chance  miss smith  be fair   i did give you fair warning     i am slitheen   oh  i love it when they run   your luke smith's too clever by half   he's right outside  there's another one  i'm after her now   oh  it feels good  after so long   rejoice in your hunt  brother   i know you're in here  i can smell you   mmm  what lovely perfume you're wearing  miss smith   you're positively fragrant   we're out of here  now  come on   what  where's luke  i know you're out there  girl     that's only mr jeffrey  and another one  a boy  you are sad   hiding from a teacher  what can he do  give you a detention  come on   oh  no   run  it's no fun if you don't run   the smell of human fear     love it   kiddies   kiddywinks   run as fast as you can  i'm coming to find you   raarghh    it's a door  and every door must have a door handle   about here   children  children  come to me   we've gotta get out of here  we can't  we need to fight them   quick  in here   so  luke  how d'you like our little science project   so where's jeffrey  i heard him   that's jeffrey  that thing chasing us  oh  i'll believe it  why not   thanks  is there a way out through here   no  there's no way out  he breaks wind  oh  no   ha ha ha   i am a child of the slitheen and this is my hunt
