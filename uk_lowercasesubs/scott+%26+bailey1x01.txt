          so  what kind of a day have you had   rachel     i think that we should cool things off for a bit   what do you mean   just   i   i   i   think it's been fun  you know  but i just       feel that i need more space at the moment   mental head space   sorry   so i've spent my day trying to think of a erm     a not unpleasant way to say it  but i suspect that there isn't one   you ok    thought you were going to propose to me   i didn't really  i      wow     so  that's it  that just seems a little bit abrupt   but if that's     will you pay for the     yeah  of course   ok  well  i'll       is there somebody else  no  no   what is it  then   are you just   are you bored with me     i know you're all shattered  ladies and gentlemen  but here we go   turkish girl  18 years old   the husband found her at 6 30 last night when he got in from work   rang for an ambulance at 6 37 saying his wife had killed herself   he sounds upset but  you know  it might just be a matter of opinion   the tape's there  have a listen to it   division called us in cos subject to post mortem  they're not happy the injuries are consistent with suicide   but he made that assumption  the husband   she'd been threatening to  according to    him  yes  but both outer doors were locked from the inside   he had to bust through a chain to get access   put his foot through the door  nearly broke his ankle   can't find her  eventually thinks to go upstairs  and he sees what you're seeing in the photos   afternoon crew interviewed him last night but he was in no fit state   he's back in today if you want to push that further for me   kevin  put that coin away before i shove it up your arse   late night  rachel   how did you get inside the building  i'm a detective   wouldn't it be better to do this when we're both sober   yeah  but i'm sat at home  going mad  and i'm thinking to myself   what the hell it is i've done that's pissed you off so much  so i thought   you know what    just go and ask him   you haven't  i don't intrude  i don't pester you at work   and i once  i once  left a toothbrush here  and the next thing i know  your cleaner's binned it   what happened to barcelona  that was only ever an idea   look  i think people just   outgrow each other   oh  is that what it is  i just don't think we're as compatible as it might have seemed   give me an example   ok  so  tonight at the restaurant  the way you ordered the wine  and the way you drank it    you do drink a lot   you knew that two years ago  there are other things   don't hold back  the other day when you were late for work  did you actually get washed before you went to work   yes  where   at work  and you wore the same clothes all day  that you'd worn the day before   are you implying that i'm unhygienic   we shouldn't have got into this   what's those   i won't let your tyres down   i might slash them  though   you ready  mate   yeah   how did it go last night   dandy  anywhere expensive   cinnamon club  ooh  so  has he proposed yet then  or what   no  not yet   mr yilmaz  sorry to be meeting under such difficult circumstances   i'm detective constable janet scott  and this is detective constable rachel bailey   so  not suicide   the post mortem indicates that the wounds weren't self inflicted   you mean burglars  no  the house was locked   i had to bust the chain  the other door was bolted   even the windows have got locks on   were there other reasons you thought she might have harmed herself   she was pregnant and she was terrified of giving birth   you know  being so far away from home   not speaking the language  everything   a couple of times she said she just wished she was dead   but nobody would do that to her     why would they do that   that's what we're going to find out  mr yilmaz   we're treating it as murder   mr yilmaz  who else knew emel was pregnant   my family  her family   everybody at work  everyone at the mosque   doctors  next door neighbours     why  why is that relevant   the nature of some of her injuries might suggest whoever did it  knew she was pregnant   you have to understand  mr yilmaz  we are going to ask you  some difficult questions   but it's for emel so we can fully work out what happened to her   it's the most important thing we can do for her now   and we have to start with you  because you found her   ok  so can you tell us where you were  between 2 00 and 4 00 yesterday afternoon and who you were with   i was at work in an office with  why  where were you  you nasty minded bitch   i realise you're in a very dark place right now  mr yilmaz   i know it's not easy   first one's free  love  after that they get more expensive   he's upset  yeah  with knobs on   question is  what's he upset about   it's an arranged marriage  don't tell me he's in love with her   she was expecting his baby  don't ask him to take it lightly   'hi  this is nick   leave a message and i'll get back to you ' oh  you arse

emel's medical records  thank you   what's this  lee  top up card   in the husband's car   yeah  side pocket  driver's door   can i borrow this five minutes   the husband's on a contract with vodaphone  gokhan yilmaz   what's he want an orange top up card for  nice one   where's jill  video room  kevin's hauled someone in   who  lad next door   what's he got on him  communal loft   nifty little escape route if you want to make it look like  someone's locked themselves in and committed suicide   kevin    i knew you'd be happy   how long have you lived with your grandparents  shaun   since i was five   how come  my mum took an overdose   not on purpose  but     how did you damage your hands   i   i   i   i   i don't   i don't exactly know   those are nasty bruises  you must know how you did it   i got off my face on friday night  i think it might have happened then   does he strike you as the sort of lad  who would think to bring flowers to the party   why would you need to if you're dropping in through the ceiling   do we know where those flowers came from   janet's on it  has he got a motive   he liked her  wanted to look after her   did he   it looks like gokhan yilmaz has got a secret shagging phone   better go and have a word with him  then  ma'am   he's finished with me   what  nick dumped me   when  day before yesterday   why  i'm boring   he didn't say that  and unhygienic   he didn't say that either  but  you know     are you all right   no   it was a couple of weeks ago   or whenever it was   he was on about a long weekend to barcelona  and he deliberately took me past that jewellers   i told you   and he asked me which one i'd choose if i was getting engaged   what does that mean   that is not me inventing stuff or misreading stuff  or making stuff up  why didn't you ask this fat fella  what he was basing it on  saying that about him and his wife   because it was in the middle of the night and i was humiliated   and he looked at me like i was some sort of shag bandit rubber knickers   look  if he is the sort of duplicitous so and so  that he's starting to sound like  perhaps you're well shot of him   it was two years  janet  i know  i know   it's a long time to be had on  but look at sharon in criminal records   that bastard strung her on for ten years  i'm not sharon   where is he  why's he taking time off work   you want answers  right   look  say he is married and say he does have a wife somewhere   presumably he's got another address  so find out where it is  and go round and have a quiet chat with him in front of his missus   i could pnc his vehicle   no   you couldn't  rachel     janet scott  i cannot believe you just suggested that  rachel   it's just one phone call   yeah  and it's just one discipline offence that gets you sacked   it's just one ub40  only if i get found out   hello  dc bailey  major incident team   can you pnc a vehicle for me  please   yeah  pin number 11 23 1   it's for intelligence   registration is tango romeo five eight victor lima delta   it'll be a silver mercedes clk 2 20   possibly registered in the name of nick or nicholas savage   yeah  thanks   you know i'm just as culpable for not reporting a discipline offence  i've witnessed as you are for committing it  ssh   yeah   no  that's fine  thanks  bye   wilmslow  registered july  2008   you really think you know somebody     yeah  don't you just   mr yilmaz  when you're ready   there's just one thing we need to clarify  mr yilmaz  and  you know  we all accept that it's possible to overlook something  or forgot something when you've had a shock  so     your mobile phone that you gave to us     er  do you have another one  one that you forgot to tell us about   perhaps we can jog your memory   the number we're interested in is an 07802 number   does that sound familiar   mr yilmaz  our telecom officer is doing a full analysis  of that number right now and he's going to find out  where it was used  when it was used  what calls have been made from it   what calls have been received   there's another phone   yes   sorry  i should have     where is it   it's   it's got nothing to do with what happened to emel   how do you know that   mr yilmaz   do you know what happened to emel because   we don't   no  no  i meant     can we do this somewhere else   i got involved in this relationship  i shouldn't have  but i did   what's she called  mana sidhu   did you use this phone to ring anyone else   no  just her   does she know that you were married   i wasn't when i met her  she knew i was engaged   did mana know emel was pregnant   she didn't want to stop seeing me  even after she found out me and emel had got married  so    did mana know emel was pregnant  look  some     random nutter has somehow broken into my house  and done this and that's who you need to be after   you may be right  mr yilmaz  but there are certain procedures  we need to follow and now we know that mana's part of the picture    she isn't  we still have to eliminate her  from our enquiries  can you give us her address   she lives with her parents  in leeds   i don't know where  somewhere   somewhere in headingley   and did she know emel was pregnant   yes   last time i saw her   i explained   that i thought it would be best not to  anymore   see each other  and since me and emel were starting a family     i wanted to  you know  do things proper   put it behind me  do the right thing   what did she say when you told her that   a bit of an argument  what did she say   threatening to tell emel  and did she   not that i know of  no  when was this  when you last saw her   four days ago  have you spoken to mana since emel died     yesterday she rang me   and er   again this morning   mr yilmaz  we're gonna take a break   are you all right   yeah  i'm fine  just struggling at every moment  not to rip his spleen out through his nose  yeah  i could tell  and i think he probably could  too   do you fancy driving over to leeds while janet finds out  about this argument they had  ma'am   and take someone who can open doors with their head  take mitch   what's up with her     woman  hello  hello  is that mrs savage   yes   hello  i'm a colleague of your husband's  is he in   er  no  he's just popped out   he's just gone to pick up one of the boys from a rugby match   i could ask him to ring you back   he shouldn't be very long  no   i'll try again later   sorry to bother you  that's all right           and 50's a pound   geoff  it's janet scott  parsons as was   hello  how are you   i'm very well  thank you   thanks for getting back to me   sorry it's taken all day  no  no  you're all right   it was to do with     my mother died  oh  i'm sorry   yeah  so  well erm     anyway  er  i came across this box in amongst all her stuff     and it was full of newspaper cuttings and       cards and letters and bits and pieces to do with our veronica   oh    and i just wondered if i could show it to you   sure   i've brought her in  geoff  can i ring you back  about fixing something up  i'm just in    yeah  yeah  yeah  of course  yeah  yeah  nice to hear from you   yeah  you  too  ok  speak soon  bye     i am not kidding  sammy  i want you take a photograph of your homework  with your telephone  completed   and then i want you to text it to me   how's kevin getting on with the boy next door   they found his knicker and spunk collection under his mattress   hers  the knickers  off the washing line  don't make him a murderer   no  but he hasn't got much of an alibi   he was  down the park   apparently   he's got kids  what   boys  nick  plural    one of the boys  was at rugby   i got a number and called it and she answered   mrs  oh  he's just popped out  happy fu   families   you've been had  haven't you   you've been well and truly had   yeah   we fell in love  i knew he was engaged  but     well  he didn't seem to think it mattered   even when he got married he still wanted to see me  so     but   i think it had run its course   so when he said he wanted to draw a line under it     when she got pregnant  i       yeah  felt that it was probably the right thing to do   have you ever been to his address in oldham   no   god  no   gokhan said that you argued when he told you that emel was pregnant   is that true  did we   this was four days ago   i wouldn't say we argued  i told him a few home truths   he said you were very upset   i think he'd like to think that  but       no   and erm  would you be surprised if i told you  that he said that you threatened to harm yourself   i didn't  well  what would your reaction be  if i told you that he said you cried and became hysterical  and threatened to tell emel about your relationship  and that he'd find out in a few day's time  that you'd thrown yourself under a bus   i'm sorry  but that means absolutely nothing to me   the most angry it got was me telling him  that he was weak willed and that i was well shot of him   can you er  tell us where you were       on tuesday afternoon  this last tuesday   i was at work  in leeds  hsbc  curzon street branch   would you have any objection to giving us your fingerprints  and a sample of your dna   if it helps   you've hurt your wrist     just scraped it   how   on a wall   was there anyone else there when you did that   hello  sorry to bother you so late   it's just that my car's broken down on the main road  and i can't get a signal  so i was wondering if i could use your phone   of course  come in   actually  my husband might be able to help  nick   nick  there's a lady here whose car has broken down on the main road   you don't fancy taking a look at it for her   there's not a lot nick doesn't know about engines  really   that's handy  hiya  sorry to spoil your evening   d   d   did   did   did it just      just stopped at the end of your lane   right  what a beautiful home   oh  thank you  have you lived here long   er   14 years   i live in chadderton  do you   yeah  still  somebody's got to  eh   i'll er  i'll put my coat on   well  well  well  full of surprises you  aren't you   i didn't know you knew everything there is to know about engines   two years in  you'd think that's something  a bright spark like me would pick up on  wouldn't you  i must be slow   gullible  a bit of a pushover   how did you find out where i lived   did you honestly think that i wouldn't   look  rachel  i'm sorry i wasn't more open and honest  at the beginning   i want the flat   what  i think i deserve something  a bit of compensation  for having two years of my life wasted  no   fine  look  rachel   don't touch me   look  i can't afford the mortgage on the flat anymore  really  that's odd  you afforded it for the last two years   the boys are starting a new school and the fees are   not my problem   i think you'll manage  a bit of careful budgeting   sort out the paperwork within two weeks or i tell her everything  and i might just drop a line to your head of chambers as well   you can't mess people around and imagine there aren't consequences   you played silly buggers with the wrong woman  pal   you made a mistake  fair enough  and now you pay for it  so you'd better start answering your phone when it's me ringing   two weeks  i'll be in touch   man  oldham mit  mitch  it's rachel   is she keeping you up  love  i've got small children  i haven't seen for three months  rachel   westbound services  m62  birch  have they got cctv cameras working   soon find out   just came to me out of the blue  i'd been staring at them  on the forecourt but the penny didn't drop   that's her  we've got her   is that time accurate  hang on   that little bitch         so  she gets in with some flowers and pleasantries   gets emel upstairs somehow  strangles her   makes it look like she hanged herself   then escapes through the loft  how does she know about the loft   how does she know there's nobody in next door's   gokhan's told her about the loft cos he's in on it  or he just has and she's remembered it   as for next door  she could have done a recce or he could have  if he's involved  this is planned   the flowers  making it look like suicide     this is so not sean whittle   and who was it put the idea of suicide in everyone's head   gokhan  whose alibi we've verified   right  well  whichever  even if those are her flowers in there  we're still waiting for something concrete  to put either mana or sean inside that house   is the lab checking next door's for her fingerprints and dna   if we think that's how she escaped     no  we thought we'd not bother  right  let's pick her up   what about him  gokhan  not yet     hello  mana sidhu   i've spoken to gill  i want you to lead this interview   why  it'll count towards your portfolio   anyway  i think you'll handle this one better than me   you're wasting your time  scotty  it's sean whittle   quietly  whatever   i was too frightened to tell you the truth   because of what happened to emel       i thought you'd think it was me   i'm sorry  what do you mean   well   she was fine when i left her   smiling  happy   but i was frightened nobody would believe me   just to clarify  what you are saying       yesterday  when we asked you had you ever visited emel's address  and you said you hadn't  that wasn't true   i'm going to ask you that question again  mana   have you ever visited  i wanted to tell her the truth   about me and gok   but i didn't hurt her   so you arrived at the address    i knocked on the door  but   then when i saw her       she looked so little and ordinary   and i don't think she'd have understood  anyway   her english wasn't that good   so i just gave her the flowers and     congratulated her on being pregnant   and then i left  what time was that    she invited me in  but i had to get back to work  so     that's right  you're a complete stranger and she invited you in   she's lying through her teeth   why did you want to tell her about you and gokhan   you know why  can you talk us through that   i thought he deserved it   stringing people on  thinking there'd be no consequences   at first  he's going to break off the engagement   then he doesn't   then  he's not going to get married   then he does   then  they're not going to have a family  then she's pregnant   and always an excuse  always a reason   some get out   and  of course  i fall for it   so   yeah   i thought she needed to know  what kind of   shallow minded   human being       she was living with   forewarned is forearmed   but like i say  when i saw her   i couldn't say it   there was no point  but i certainly didn't hurt her   we know whoever did it made their way out the loft   and that's what i'm struggling with with you   you see  i'm wondering if it was you  how you would know that you could get from one house to the other  through the loft   even if you had been to that address before  i still don't know how you would know that   no  well       i didn't  it's the kind of thing you could only know  if someone told you   what's she doing  she's just given her a fucking defence   what the hell is she doing   yeah  well   maybe   and the only person who could tell you that  is someone who knew the house well  who lived there  would you agree   yeah  i suppose   to sum up  your intention when you set off  was to tell emel about gokhan   and it was only when you got there  saw her on the doorstep  that you felt that you couldn't and so you just decided  to congratulate her on being pregnant instead  yeah   i'm going to go back to when you were buying the flowers   the cctv we've just shown you   at that moment  that was your intention  to tell her about you and gokhan  yeah   about what a  shallow minded   whatever he was    yeah   why do you buy someone flowers to tell them that   i just     i can understand congratulating someone on being pregnant  but you said you didn't decide to do that until you saw her   i   just thought it was a nice thing to do   it is   it just doesn't tie in with intending to tell someone  something challenging  devastating about the husband  does it   results from the lab  mana sidhu's blood confirmed on the banister  of the whittle staircase   and on the doorjamb going into the kitchen   got you  you bitch   i'm wondering if you could talk us through  what you imagine that conversation would go like   give it to rachel   at what point during telling her about her husband  would you offer her the flowers   because this just isn't making sense to me   hang on  andy   taking flowers to me suggests someone turning up with a smile       who's hoping to be invited in for some reason   he did tell me about the loft   i'm sorry  gokhan   he told me about the loft and he said other things as well   about if she was dead   what things   about how we could be together if she didn't exist   stuff like this   look  you can't even begin to imagine  the sacrifices that i have made for that man   i think i probably can   i thought it was what he wanted   what happened  rachel got a confession  just as the lab report came in   well done  thanks   you all right   yeah  i just never  ever charged anyone for murder before  and felt sorry for them  she strangled and hanged  an 18 year old girl and then murdered her unborn baby   what's to feel sorry for   it's him  she did it because of him   now he's going to walk away  cos in the eyes of the law he's an ok guy   she made the decision to kill  whatever hell he put her through     you think and you talk shit sometimes  janet   thank you   boss  are we going to arrest him   what for   implying things  feel free   knock yourself out  he put ideas in her head   do you want to go into the video room  and watch that fantastic interview you just conducted  where you said to her  very directly    did he  at any point  tell you to kill his wife    and she goes   no  but     did he say it would be a good idea  if you killed his wife    no  but      did he tell you to go through the loft and kill someone    no  but     she took an inference  he did not intend   he was trying to get rid of her  mana  not emel   he's got to live with the fact he's lost his wife and his baby  because he got involved with that loony bitch  so if you think i should arrest him  frankly  rachel     i'm tempted to think that says more about you than it does about him   sorry  janet   it upset me when i found it   realising that she probably never had another moment's peace  all her life  after that tea time when they knocked on the door  and told her  parents don't   there's nothing worse   i became a copper because of veronica   did you  i got it into my head that it was my fault that she died   why   well   i have this image in my head        and erm  i'm not sure if it's a memory  or if it's something that i just made up  but   when she disappeared  all i was told was that she'd gone away   and then when i was about 15  out of the blue   my mother said to me something about     erm   you know that girl  the one that was murdered  veronica    and   i had no idea until then that that's what had happened to her   anyway   this image erm  it was the last time i saw her     er  i was with her on a street in oldham   and a car drove up to us and     a man asked us if we wanted to go for a ride   and she seemed to know him  but i didn't so i said   no    but she really wanted to  so she did   but   the odd thing is  aged six   there's no way my mother would have let me  be out and about on my own in a street in oldham  so       i don't know   but   i've always thought that       i saw the man who killed her   and   that's why i joined the police   to find out   to find out why no one was ever caught   and you know  i did look into it  but     when you're on the job  you've enough on  keeping up with the new ones   is that what you wanted to ask me   if we could reopen it  yeah   yeah   cos i thought when i found all this  i thought       it's something i ought to try and find out about   for my mother  and for her  our veronica   leave it with me   you realise that this is blackmail  no  nick  it's compensation   which carries a sentence of up to ten years in prison   i'm not making unwarranted demands with menaces   well  i find it pretty menacing   well  maybe  but i would be happy to go face to face with you in court  about whether it's unwarranted or not   i want an understanding that this is it   you can't make any more demands on me after this   whatever   fancy going for a drink  you can't want a baby   why not  am i not the type   do you think he's still alive  i know he is  love   she said she burnt it  who     she'd been raped every which way from christmas   he's put a petrol bomb through the sitting room window   hands behind your back  move  lady   i'm arresting you on suspicion of murder
