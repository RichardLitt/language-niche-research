didn't want your opinion  i wanted medicine  which i have got   so just go and drive into somebody else   mr fenn  there is a high probability you have a cancer of the larynx   you'll need surgery and you may well lose your voice  which has a certain appeal   you may not care about this  but unfortunately i'm paid to   i'll arrange for a referral    richard edgerton  ent   yeah  it's martin ellingham here  i've got a patient needs an urgent laryngoscopy   yes  that is my opinion  stop it   stop it   hm   well  i'd say it was a carcinoma of the larynx   because i'm a doctor  he's a smoker with a lump in his neck   would you like the tumour to write to you   will you get out of that bin   right  you  dog  dog  dog  dog  dog  dog  here   fetch    cornwall's lovely  isn't it   all this sea breeze makes you feel so alive     i'm carmen    oh   doc  i understand about elaine  hard to be her employer  i should imagine     it wasn't a decision i took lightly    pretty hard to be her father  too   like father  like daughter  isn't that right  lady lancelot  yes  it is   she is bloody minded  no point pretending otherwise   no   well  she's got  um  personality     oh  yeah  by the bucketful    oh  she'll be at that church  she'll come round     elaine and carmen just don't get on    he's exaggerating  she's not used to me yet   well  that's a shame  um     i've gotta look for

go on  make poopie   elaine can't handle me being with anyone     are you married    er  no     why not    see  i thought   what is the point    you know  a life alone   what is it for   i mean  obviously not you  you do something positive  i just mean the rest of us   you contribute  and that must feel    you know  saving lives       what is your dog doing    ah  um     your dog  he has been done  hasn't he     it's not my dog    oh  um       hello  fancy a drink   er  no  thanks  don't want to get tar and feathers on my jacket     the wrath of elaine    yeah   come back to mine  i've got a good single malt on the go   no  thanks   night  doc     hello  mrs winter   just a guess   right   thank you for letting me know  goodbye       ellingham    it's richard edgerton here at ent     yeah    i've got the histology back on roger fenn   uh huh    we set to sea  in a boat made of flowers  drifted for days till our lips tasted land    it was bitter     hello   on the last breath of day  chased the hot metal skies of the ocean    with no emotion   roger   we came by night  to the fortunate islands  laying like fish 'neath the nets of our kisses  that's why this is     don't stop on my account   are you lost  or looking for children to frighten     you used to be in a band    yes  l  er     i gave it up for something more sensible   something that would see me through to a nice  safe retirement   well  that  er     that sounded  um     hoarse   what do you do when you're not working   i'm always working   and there was me thinking this was going to be a social call   well  i went in for my biopsy  when do i get the results back   oh   i can talk you through what happens next   i've booked you in for surgery next friday   the 13th  actually   perfect     got more in the van  where do you want it     i didn't order this    you ellingham   the person who ordered this is no longer here  take it away     oh  i can't do that    yes  you can  you've got a van     i can't take it away until you accept delivery    what     you can't return something until you accept it    i see   it's not rocket science  you accept delivery  then you get a returns number   then you arrange a time to have your packages picked up     i come and collect 'em    you do     yeah    well  why don't you just take it now   mind if i use your loo       you all right    that took a while     what    poor urine flow  any discomfort     you what    have you had your prostate checked     what    it might be enlarged  i should have a look at it     what  up the    won't take a minute   hello  bobby     feeling better    i don't like you   that's all right  because  um  i like you   you were mean to elaine  my sisters say you're the w word   the t word  the p word   and the z word     what's the z word    it's a word   this is your new owner  and this is your new home  which is a farm   which dogs are supposed to enjoy  so bugger off and leave me alone   look  all i'm saying is that it isn't exactly politic to sack a perfectly good receptionist    perfectly good   she made appointments before i'd opened   she printed out prescriptions that were potentially lethal     well  surely you checked them    i had to go to the school to trace a child  because she couldn't take a phone number     it was pure luck      that he had a sore throat  bobby richards     oh  come on  marty    but elaine wasn't to know that   everyone makes mistakes   but she can't admit them  you pick her up on something  she comes back with a complaint   and when you make a mistake  you roll over and let them tickle your tum     elaine  what's happened to you     it's tan    it's orange   i need my wages   don't think you can charm me into taking you back   i don't want to come back   i'm going to majorca  innit     i don't know how much i owe you    i do     how long are you going for    month  two   you'll miss your father's wedding   diddums   you got cash     i think it would mean a lot to him    so   why do i have to make him feel good about his decision   i don't feel good about it   don't know what he sees in her   what is it with men and big baps   it's offensive   elaine     were you very young when your mum died   i mean  i think  you know  people will understand how hard that must have been   and difficult for you to move on and see your father move on   whoever the woman was   i suppose i could have been more understanding   get paid for that in london  do you   look  i don't mind him having a woman   just not one with a bloody dog in her handbag   hasta la vista     oh  louisa  have you seen martin   no  sorry  on my way to see roger in hospital  he's having his main op today  so excuse me   now  maybe that's where martin is  look  if you see him   can you tell him that his dog seems to have decided not to play  spot on the farm    actually  joan  i gather martin hasn't been by or near the hospital   yes  yes  i heard that he and roger didn't hit it off     i'm not very impressed  to be honest    roger is a very difficult man  as you well know   he's got cancer  he needs care  it's not as if martin's got any other patients to worry about   if you're annoyed with martin  i suggest you take it up with him   he's your nephew   weren't you on the committee that appointed him   roger   again   we don't speak in over a year  now it's twice in two days  i must get cancer more often   i can't stay so long this time  i've     of course  you have my job to get back to  don't you   i'll ask the nurse on the way out   well     so       everyone at school sends their love    oh  really   last time they sent their love  it was in an envelope with a p45   so     did the surgeon say exactly what they were going to do today   i don't know   this guy makes ellingham look like florence nightingale   so still no sign of martin   why does that bother you so much     why would i want to see him  anyway    maybe he could tell you what was going on   oh  i'll tell you what's going on   i've been pushed out of my job an inch before i qualify for a pension   and minutes before i am about to lose my voice forever   i find myself having to chat with the woman who replaced me    visiting time's over   roger     i'm so sorry     ent  please    down the glass corridor  second floor   my keys  i'm parked in mr brownlow's spot     and you are    dr martin ellingham  portwenn     you're a gp    that's right  yes  and you're a receptionist   excuse me  come back here     you can't park in the staff car park    i've a patient to see   is it me  or do you not understand plain english   it's you   martin  martin     adrian  adrian pitts    oh  yes   the great martin ellingham  who abused myself and others at st mary's   buggered us senseless  but taught us a lot about medicine   so what brings you here  chief  knifing a bigwig     no  actually  i've given up surgery    you're kidding     i've got a patient to see    of course     i'd heard he couldn't hack it    i'll tell you about that    don't worry  it's just a nosebleed   are you all right   here  let me do that for you  mr ellingham   i read you on blocked carotids   don't suck up   has the surgeon been in yet   yeah   and i thought you were a smug bastard   god  i'm gonna miss swearing   if the cells haven't spread  there's a chance the voice can be saved   yeah  yeah  he said that  same choice of words  too    the voice   it's not  the voice    sorry  your voice   mind if i have a glass of water   are you all right     you're a funny colour    i'm fine   i've got cancer  but you look worse   whatever   l  um     sometimes have a heightened emotional reaction to certain events   which is medical speak for   panic attacks  i sometimes have small panic attacks   what kind of panic attacks   er    nausea  sweating  chest pain     what brings them on    smells   the smell of cauterised flesh   and blood  the smell of that  sometimes just the sight of it   i used to have the midas touch  i couldn't look at a body on the operating table without fixing it   then one day  in the middle of the most mundane procedure   another set of arteries laid out in front of me   it suddenly dawned on me  for the first time  that this was somebody's wife   somebody's mother  and i couldn't do it   i couldn't go on  like i was on a high wire  i made the mistake of looking down   i haven't operated since   so now i'm your gp   you probably want to keep that quiet   yeah  i wouldn't want the village to fall out of love with me   your secret's safe with me   well  it's not like you're gonna be able to tell anyone anyway  is it   had any family in   grown up daughter  decided not to call her   she stopped needing me a long time ago     she has a tv set all of her own    oh
