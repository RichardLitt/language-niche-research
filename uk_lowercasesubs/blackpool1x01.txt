machine's dropping coins down the back  it means it's full and    if it's full  it's more likely to pay out    is that true   no  not really  but that's the market economy  isn't it   if we admitted it were all down to luck  we'd pay bankers the same as binmen   and like  if she had the questions  but you got the answer right  then you got to say what she did next   you've really thought this through  haven't you   the inland revenue aren't gonna wait for last year's tax bill   they're gonna make a claim against     see the skinny guy behind pythagoras  that's the ghost  every arcade has one   they hover on the mug's shoulder  watching how much money he puts in   then they step in for the kill when he wanders off   see him  the priest   he bases his game on prayer and lucky coins   and the lard addict on the multiplay  your nervous wreck   he can't keep still for noticing every other machine seems to be paying out   he never commits  so he never wins     yeah  fascinating as this is      i know my business   you know yours  that's how we make each other rich   you're just gonna have to use some of the investment capital    we've put to one side for the expansion    isn't

 not exactly up to your standards  terry  i know   bloody hell  couldn't you run to a couple of air fresheners   well  why bother when i'm pulling it down anyway     lf it doesn't fall down first    i still don't see what this proves   i think you're forgetting a little word called trust   come on  make yourself useful  now you're here   who are we  the bloody repo men   i can't involve myself in this sort of thing  i'm a pillar of the community   you wanted me to get a move on  didn't you  so come on  let's get started   i just think it's a bit off you paying your private tax bill with company money   i've led you two to a pot of gold and all you can do is piss in it   he's not wrong  we're shareholders     we should have a say in how it's spent    so you want the scheme to go tits up  because i've got a pain in the cash flow  fine     no  obviously  we don't want that    come on  then   i'll go and arrange for the transfer of funds to your personal account   you won't be moaning when you've got  no vacancies  up all the year round   then it will be   thank you  ripley holden   for dragging blackpool out of the dark ages    i'm driving the economic recovery round here  so cut me some slack  would you     what's going on    you've been evicted   what for   drug taking  noise  being ugly without a licence  who knows   the law's supposed to be a mystery  that's why judges wear wigs   you know  vegas gets 30 million visitors a year   the punters piss in paper cups by the machines  because they're terrified of missing the jackpot   that's the type of customer commitment i'm after   what are you doing   could you put some beer in the fridge  he might be a beer man   who might be   shyanne's new boyfriend  she's bringing him over tonight   since when   you said you wanted to meet him and she took you at your word   when are you going to bring a girl home  give me something to look at   going anywhere nice tonight  love   hey  answer your mother's question   i don't know  maybe romeo's   romeo's  weren't you there last night  why does it always have to be clubs   i was in romeo's last night  i didn't see you there   it's a big club   you and the lads were in romeo's  isn't there an age limit   i've got to go  i said i'd be somewhere   what makes that lad tick   he's just going through a sensitive stage   oh  right  and there was me thinking he was a mardy arse   what   your face     if this one's got tattoos  he can keep walking   he won't have tattoos  she said he was more mature than the others   yeah  well  i live in hope     mum  dad   this is steve   hi   so what do you do for a living  steve   i work in the theatre     would we have seen you in anything    i doubt it  i'm the manager     which theatre's that  then    the theatre royal   never been there   now if you'd said legends  there's a bloke down there the absolute image of shakin' stevens   really  and who's he supposed to be     well  the royal  that must be quite a big responsibility   is that where the krankies did panto this year   i've not been there that long  i'm planning big changes   yeah  he's put in for lottery funding   you'd better get in line behind all those lesbian refugees     dad    no  i believe in people paying their way   i organise charity events myself  but i make sure  the money goes to bona fide handicapped   let's face it   these days you have a nosebleed and you get a disabled parking space   so how did you get into something like that  steve   i've always loved the theatre  but i knew i couldn't act  so this is the next best thing   well  my tip to you is  give people what they want and they'll come   that rules out my play about lesbian refugees  then     that's funny  steve   maybe you should have been on the stage after all   actually  we've got to go   yeah  well  already   yeah  well  we've got that thing  haven't we  steve   yes  yes     nice to meet you    and you     goodbye    bye bye   is she doing this to punish us  is that what she's up to   maybe she likes him  has that occurred to you   that's what all child molesters say   look  i don't like it any more than you do  but shyanne is nearly 20   exactly  and he's my age  i can't believe you're taking this so calmly   if this wasn't your daughter  you'd be patting him on the back   so i'm a hypocrite  is there a law against that  too   you keep ranting and raving and you'll make it seem rebellious and sexy   what  so we just do nothing   i don't want a repeat of the motorbike incident   yeah  okay     okay  you're probably right    yeah  well  i usually am   what     nothing    what is it     i think i drank a bit too much last night    do you want to talk about it   do i look like richard madeley   no  come on       her hair is soft and her eyes are oh so blue    she's all the things a girl should be    but she's not you    she knows just how to make me laugh when i feel blue    she's everything a man could want    but she's not you    and when we're dancing    it almost feels the same    i've got to stop myself from whispering your name    she even kisses me like you used to do    and it's just breaking my heart 'cause she's not you    and it's just breaking my heart 'cause she's not you          ripley  hello   what are you doing here  i didn't hear you come in   and you never will   the old kung fu shuffle   i see you've got tony vialli   the world's greatest accordion player coming next month   yeah  we do golden variety for the pensioners mid week   but like i say  it's my intention to shake things up a bit   listen to andrew lloyd webber here   i realise it might sound funny to you   if you weren't going out with my daughter  it might sound funny   but there's something about the thought of you near her  that makes me lose my sense of humour   shyanne's a wonderful woman  she's turned my life around   don't use my daughter to make you feel better about yourself     i don't think that's how shyanne sees it    steve   i'm a man of the world   i know it's nice to feel flesh with a bit of spring in it  but society has taboos for a reason   and that reason is so saggy arsed old burn outs like you  don't get their hands on a wet dream like my daughter   i know this must be hard to accept   what i find hard to accept is you sit pretending you don't know who i am     i don't know you    south shore secondary modern    yeah  you were there  too  we were at the same school   now you're poking my daughter   i'm trying not to break a rib laughing at the coincidence     i don't remember you    i've changed   i think i'd remember a name like ripley holden   i wasn't ripley holden then     who were you    someone else   have you got a pen   yeah     now there's a name you might remember   what you should know is     that ripley holden is a ton more messed up than this boy   where've you been   i've been standing here since 9 30 with a burning ulcer   all right  give me some room  would you  chantelle     ruth  you need a man  a good seeing to will do you more good than liver salts   oh  i thought i set this last night   you can't buy a bastard thing in this country   mr holden   that's right   detective inspector peter carlisle  north lakes constabulary   that boyish looking creature is d c  blythe   i just can't get my head round this  why is this happening to me  why now   it's a full blown mystery  sir  that's why i'm here   do i know you at all  you one of allbright's lot   no  i'm not local  they called me in because they're overstretched   sort of like an emergency plumber  but less well paid   so  you found the body   i open the door  go over to the alarm  start putting in the code  then i notice it's not on   and then  there he is  in all his glory     do you recognise him    never seen him before in my life     do you want to take another look    has anybody got a rennie on them   i have a very nervous tummy and this has set it off   funnily enough  somewhere   i never leave home without antacids   keep them  i'm taking kaolin and morphine on a trial basis   no  i definitely don't know him   why would anybody do this  i just     i locked up last night and i opened up this morning   so how did he get in here   we're filing it as a suspicious death for now  just to keep the paperwork in order   suspicious  it's miraculous   he got through a locked door  tripped the alarm  then killed himself   what makes you think he killed himself   i don't  i was making a joke   freud would say that your jokes revealed a truth buried in your subconscious   oh  what do you know  a copper who's read a book   well  if i'd read two books  maybe i'd run an amusement arcade   well  i wouldn't know about that  i run a family entertainment centre   and i'm a crime citizen interface consultant   political correctness strikes again   you know what   i get chinky lads down here all the time and they tell me kung fu jokes   we'll always find new insults  prejudice is very inventive like that   that's right   you know what he's done  don't you   he's hid behind the dance stage while i'm locking up   tried to rob the slots  got himself electrocuted     thanks for sorting that out for us    he looked the type  didn't he   you know  hair like that   i'll do everything i can to get you open again as soon as possible     what  you're closing me down    just till forensics are happy   no  i know it's a tragic loss and everything  but i've got the biggest deal of my life riding on this arcade   you can read about it in here   thanks   i think i know where you're coming from   scruffy bastard   so  what's the arcade chap like     a prick    a guilty prick   a prick has no conscience  didn't your father tell you anything   his story seems a little unlikely   acquire an id on the body  go through the cctv from the pubs and clubs     talk to witnesses   the gruelling but necessary slog that makes our police force enviable     what are you going to do    i'll start with ripley's wife   i'm good with wives   a dead man  just there on the floor   dead as southport he was  six feet from the kiddies rides  how sick is that   that is awful  who was he   i don't know  neither do the police  some deadbeat or other   it'd be a deadbeat  that's right     i've had to close the arcade    how long for   so what did they think  the coppers  they got any ideas   have they heck   they'll just tit around for a few days and file it away   got to look like they're earning the tax payers' shilling  haven't they   shyanne     love   he's finished with me by text   how cheap is that   so     no explanation or anything   just said it wasn't working for him   he was sorry  that was it   oh  cheap bastard  eh   i don't know what you're getting angry about  i could tell you didn't like him   i'll be straight  you know  i did have a few problems about the age difference  but only because i want what's best for you   well  he is   i love him  dad   and don't you start telling me i'll get over it   look at me   hey  look at me   when i was your age  i was the loneliest bastard on this bastard planet   and the worst thing was people telling me it was going to get better     but for what it's worth  you're a beautiful  intelligent young woman   and the man you're gonna spend the rest of your life with  is out there now  somewhere   you've not even met him yet   isn't that something to get excited about   i suppose   steve's a bigger prick than i thought he was to finish with you     you were doing well till that last bit    come here   you don't think mum warned him off or anything  do you   no   your mum's a bit of a hothead  but she'd never do anything like that   so that's the last we'll be seeing of steve  i suppose   broke the poor girl's heart     quite a coincidence though  isn't it    what's that   you meet him  you don't like him  and the next day he finishes with shyanne   yeah  that's why it's called coincidence  i suppose   i didn't know you believed in coincidence   i run an amusement arcade  of course  i believe in coincidence   how else could i look the punter in the eye   yeah  well  maybe we'll leave that one for another day   are you feeling horny at all   i love it when you whisper sweet nothings   is that a yes or a no   well  a little more effort might be nice   you know  something a bit romantic     do you want to talk about it    piss off  ripley   now who's being romantic        whole lotta shakin'goin' on   oh  boy    ripley holden used to own three arcades off promenade  but he sold them all 6 months ago to bid for this promenade site when it came up     he's got a lot riding on it    he's a great salesman   says who   it's what i've been getting from everybody i've spoken to   he believes in family  money and blackpool  not always in that order   what about the family  what did you get on them   danny  the son  goes to a private school  but the local police think he might be dabbling in soft drugs   well  who didn't at his age   the daughter  shyanne  goes to college locally   and natalie holden is the perfect trophy wife   combines public appearances with dedicated housewife and charity work   and she scrubs up nicely by all accounts     i wouldn't know    i'll report back to you once i've met her   the question is  what's she doing with ripley holden   oh  blythe  one day you'll fall in love  and you'll find out that the heart is a complicated and capricious organ   right  back to the arcade then  is it   yeah  for me  i'm gonna get a list of key holders off ripley holden   what  on your own   ripley and i already have a breathless repartee   i wouldn't want you coming between us   there's your problem   great  romanian   went on holiday there once   cigarettes and coffee  that's the only currency they believe in   it's some sort of foreign coin   yes  thank you  hugh scully   inspector carlisle     have you come to give me my arcade    no  not quite   i was wondering if you could give me a list  of anybody who has access to keys to this place   hang on a minute   you don't think my staff have anything to do with this  do you   have you checked whether he was electrocuted yet   we did  and he wasn't   the early signs are that he'd been dead for a day or so before you found him   so he were dumped here   well  you see  i attract a lot of jealousy   because we don't like success in this country  do we   so i'd start with the anti gambling mob and the other arcade owners   but not my staff  no way  they love working here  they're like family   in a good way or a fred west way   the bar x   a design classic  you know  graphics  fun themes   high low rollers can come and go but this beauty     nothing hidden   that's right  and a simpleton could enjoy it   clearly     do you want a go    i'm busy   go on  have a go  on me   and if i were you  i'd try that machine two along   who knows  you might have a bit of beginner's luck   the list of the key holders   no point  you won't be working on this much longer   why  are you ready to confess already   does the name jim allbright mean anything to you   no  why  should it   see  what you're not getting is i'm somebody around here   which makes me  what  nobody     don't flatter yourself  cock  you're not even that   ruth  we'll be open tomorrow   so get maureen to set the cafe up and you have a bath tonight   see you later   it's not as easy as you think  ripley  it's complicated   what's complicated  you're the big cheese  give him the red card   he's from outside the town  he's been sent across from kendal   it's his case now  so he's not under my jurisdiction   which leaves you as what  deputy chief inspector of donkey shit   what is it he's done to upset you exactly   he thinks me and my staff have got something to do with that lad's death   you might not care about that  but you should care that he's shut the arcade and he's keeping it shut   which means nobody makes any money  not me  not you  not anybody   look  this carlisle bloke is just a shit copper with an ego problem   it's the same with anybody we bring in for the overflow cases   he'll have only ever done small town crime so he'll be excited for a few days   you won't have to put up with him for too long   is that the best you can do   all right  i'll have a word  mark his card   i'm touched our friendship means so much to you   don't be like that   and i want that sunbed back         hi   can i help you   i think i'm beyond help   i'm sorry  i thought you rang the bell   yeah  i did  i did   but i'm not quite sure why  i just saw the door and the sign     just had to ring the bell    exactly   yeah  i played a lot of knock and run as a child  sometimes i regress   i see   okay  well  i've got phones to answer  so     so  do you work here  then   i'm a volunteer  yeah   and you'll just talk to anyone who comes in off the street   yeah  that's the general idea   even me   even you  yeah   listen  do you want to come inside and we can talk about what's troubling you   what makes you think anything's troubling me   well  you don't seem to be able to walk away   if you did want to talk about something  you might at least want to come inside   are you depressed   erm  not yet  but i've only been here a couple of days   i have a question   i can't work out why anyone would do this     why do you say that    so you're not going to answer me  then     we're not here to talk about me    no  but i'd like to   why   there you go again  evasive  you're very good at that  aren't you   why are you trying to trick me into talking about myself all the time   come on  just tell me why you do this and then i'll open up     i'm nosy    you're very fortunate   not everyone can turn their vices into charitable works   i hadn't really seen it like that before   would you like to go out for a drink with me   it's not possible  it's not what i'm here for   but if i was to bump into you in the street and ask you out then     what would you say   i'd say      thank you very much        but i'm married     but not happily     because you're not happy  are you    that's none of your business   and that's why you do this  because if you listen to people who are unhappier than you   it makes the pain seem that bit easier  doesn't it   doesn't it occur to you     that there might be somebody who wants to talk to me    who really does need my time    how do you know that isn't me   well  i hope you got what you came for   what   you're just not what i'd imagined     can i help you   peter carlisle   deputy chief inspector jim allbright   what's this doing up   he's our main suspect   you're coming at this a bit sideways  aren't you  son     i thought he found the body    he did   and it turns out the victim died on the night the arcade had its opening party   so that rules him in  not out   you should have come to me first  i was at the party   ripley was with me all night   of course  you're ripley holden's friend  i thought that name rang a bell   that's right   so what were you doing on the night in question  as the cliche goes   we were just out and about  you know     i'm going to need more than that    it was a lad's night out   am i to understand you were pursuing romantic liaisons  with members of the opposite sex  sir   nothing hardcore  just a bit of fun   you wouldn't find a more devoted father than ripley holden   devoted to what  exactly   i hope you're not trying to make a name for yourself  son   thanks for the alibi  jim   holden seems to have borrowed money from every businessman in town  to do the arcade up   it's funny  he doesn't strike me as the trustworthy type   come on  let's go and play the slots   what for   i trust you aren't questioning my methodology  blythe     i wasn't aware you had a methodology    you stay there  then   would you look at that   nudge  hi lo  take feature  am i supposed to be this confused   if you save your nudges  you can get up one of the trails   then you get into the feature tower   it's like a foreign language   you're that copper  aren't you   that's right  you're danny holden  aren't you   there  nudge now  middle reel   there   that's great  i don't have a clue how i did it but that's great   mate of mine grew up in blackpool   this was years ago now  said he hated being a local     you know why    why   because if it wasn't pissed up geordie week   it was pissed up glasgow week   and if it wasn't mancs  it was the scousers   and they all wanted to do one thing  beat up the locals     nothing changes    yeah  i'll bet   so  did you see this man in any fights the other night   no   are you sure  because we've got you and him on cctv  going into romeo's within ten minutes of each other   i didn't see him there  i never saw him after he left this place   he was here   at the arcade opening night  are you sure   of course i'm sure  you could hardly miss hair like that  could you   okay  braveheart  what do you think you're doing   i'm just trying to ascertain where science ends and luck begins   you're talking to my son  he's a minor   you don't talk to my son without me being there  understand   okay  i'll just collect my winnings   mr holden  just one question and i'll be gone     what do you want to know    what's an awp   amusement with prizes  like that machine you've just been playing   i see  amusement with prizes   sounds a bit like life itself  doesn't it   and you are absolutely sure  you didn't see him here at your opening night party   absolutely  you know why   because he wasn't here that night  now  are you sure of your way out       you keep lyin' when you oughta be truthin'    and you keep losin' when you oughta not bet    you keep samin' when you oughta be a'changin'    now  what's right is right but you ain't been right yet    these boots are made for walking and that's just what they'll do    one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you    you keep playin' where you shouldn't be playin'    and you keep thinkin' that you'll never get burnt    i just found me a brand new box of matches  yeah    and what he knows you ain't had time to learn    these boots are made for walking and that's just what they'll do    one of these days
