man  no young man  no matter how great  can know his destiny   he cannot glimpse his part in the great story that is about to unfold   like everyone  he must live and learn   and so it will be for the young warlock  arriving at the gates of camelot   a boy that will  in time  father a legend   his name       merlin      let this serve as a lesson to all   this man  thomas james collins   is adjudged guilty of conspiring to use enchantments and magic   and pursuant to the laws of camelot   i  uther pendragon  have decreed that such practices are banned  on penalty of death   i pride myself as a fair and just king   but for the crime of sorcery   there is but one sentence i can pass     when i came to this land  this kingdom was mired in chaos   with the people's help  magic was driven from the realm   so i declare a festival  to celebrate 20 years since the great dragon was captured  and camelot freed from the evil of sorcery   let the celebrations begin     there is only one evil in this land and it is not magic   it is you       with your hatred and your ignorance   you took my son   and i promise you  before these celebrations are over   you will share my tears   an eye for an eye  a tooth for a tooth   a son for a son   seize her     where would i find gaius  the court physician       hello     hello   gaius    whoa   arggh    what the    what did you just do   um    tell me   well  uh   i have no idea what happened   if anyone had seen that    no  that was nothing to do with me   i know what it was  i want to know where you learnt it   nowhere   how do you know magic  i don't   where did you study   answer me  i've never studied magic or been taught   are you lying  what do you want me to say   the truth  i was born like this   that's impossible   who are you   oh  uh    i have this letter   i    i don't have my glasses   i'm merlin  hunith's son   yes   you're not meant to be here till wednesday   it is wednesday   ah  right  then   you better put your bag in there   look  you won't say anything about     no   though  merlin     i should say thank you   woman  my dear  gaius  i turn to you for i feel lost and alone  and don't know who to trust   it is every mother's fate to think her child is special   yet i would give my life that merlin were not   ours is a small village and he is so clearly at odds with people here  that if he were to remain  i fear what will become of him   he needs a hand to hold  a voice to guide   someone that might help him find a purpose for his gifts   i beg you   if you understand a mother's love for her son   keep him safe   and may god save you both       morgana yes   what is this  why are you not joining us   i don't think chopping someone's head off  is cause for a celebration   that poor mother   simple justice for what he'd done  to whom   he practised magic  he didn't hurt anyone   you were not around 20 years ago  you have no idea   how long will you punish people   in my kingdom   you will be with me when i greet lady helen   i want no part of this   i am your guardian   i expect you to do as i ask   if you show me no respect  at least respect our finest singer   your brutality will just create more enemies           hello   gregory   lady helen   is all well   yes  with luck  we'll reach camelot tomorrow   that's good  i'm outside if you need me       who's there   who's there            merlin   merlin   i got you water   you didn't wash last night  sorry   help yourself to breakfast   oh  oh   did you incant a spell in your mind   i don't know any spells   so what did you do  there must be something   it just happened   well  we better keep you out of trouble   you can help me until i find some paid work for you   here   hollyhock and feverfew for lady percival  and this is for sir olwen   he's blind as a weevil  so warn him not to take it all at once   and here   off you go   and merlin   i need hardly tell you  that the practice of any form of enchantments will get you killed   um   i brought you your medicine   oh  gaius said don't drink it all     i'm sure it's fine   man  where's the target   there  sir  that's into the sun   it's not that bright  bit like you  then   put the target down the other end  shall i  sir    teach him a lesson   this'll teach him   teach him a lesson    hey  hang on   don't stop   here   i told you to keep moving   come on  run   we want some moving target practice   hey  come on  that's enough   what  you've had your fun  my friend   do i know you   i'm merlin  so i don't know you   no  yet you called me friend   that was my mistake   i think so  yeah   i'd never have a friend who could be such an ass   or i one who could be so stupid   merlin  do you know how to walk on your knees   no  shall i help you   i wouldn't if i were you  what are you gonna do   you have no idea  be my guest  come on  come on   come on   i'll throw you in jail for that   do you think you're the king  no  i'm his son   arthur     lady helen   thank you so much for coming to sing at our celebrations   pleasure's all mine  how was your journey   the time it took  it's worth the wait   it will be    merlin   merlin   merlin   gaius  merlin   g    uh   you never cease to amaze me   the one thing that someone like you should do is keep your head down   what do you do   i'm sorry   you're lucky  i pulled a few strings to get you released   oh  thank you  thank you   i won't forget this   well  there is a small price to pay   oh  god      thanks     i'm guinevere  but most people call me gwen   i'm the lady morgana's maid   right  i'm merlin   although most people just call me  idiot    no  no  i saw what you did   you were so brave   or stupid   i'm glad you walked away  you weren't going to beat him   i could beat him  you think   because you don't look like one of these big muscly fellows   thanks   i'm sure you're stronger than you look   it's just arthur's one of these real rough  tough   save the world kind of men   and   well    what   you don't look like that   i'm in disguise     it's great you stood up to him  you think so   arthur's a bully and everyone thought you were a real hero   really  mm hm   oh  excuse me  guinevere   my fans are waiting   want some vegetables with that    i know you're still angry with me   your mother asked me to look after you   yes   what did your mother say to you about your gifts   that i was special   you are special   the likes of which i have never seen before   what do you mean   well  magic requires incantations  spells   it takes years to study   what i saw you do was    elemental  instinctive   what's the point if it can't be used   that i do not know   you are a question that has never been posed before  merlin   did you ever study magic   uther banned all such work  why   people used magic for the wrong end   it threw the natural order into chaos   uther's mission is to destroy everything from back then   even the dragons  all of them   there was one dragon he chose not to kill   kept it as an example   he imprisoned it in a cave deep beneath the castle  where no one can free it   now eat up   when you finish  you'll take a preparation to lady helen   she needs it for her voice     what are you doing in here   um   i was   i was asked to deliver this   how's your knee walking coming along   oh  don't run away   from you  ah  thank god   thought you were deaf as well as dumb   look  i've told you you're an ass   i just didn't realise you're a royal one   oh  what are you going to do  you got your daddy's men to protect you    i could take you apart with one blow   i could take you apart with less   you sure  come on     here you go  big man     come on  then   i warn you  i've been trained to kill since birth   wow  and how long have you been training to be a prat   you can't address me like that   sorry  how long have you been training to be a prat   my lord   come on  then  merlin   come on   whoa     arggh  ha ha   you're in trouble now  oh  god   o arggh     want to give up  do you   do you  do you want to give up     arggh   wait  let him go   he may be an idiot  but he's a brave one   there's something about you  merlin  i can't quite put my finger on it   how could you be so foolish   he needed a lesson   magic must be studied  mastered and used for good  not for pranks   i could move objects before i could talk   you should control yourself   i don't want to  if i can't use magic  what have i got   i'm just a nobody  and who always will be   if i can't use magic   i might as well die   merlin   sit up  take your shirt off     you don't know why i was born like this  do you   no   i'm not a monster  am i   don't ever think that   then why am i like this  please  i need to know why   maybe there's someone with more knowledge than me   if you can't tell me  no one can   take this   it will help with the pain   will you sing for me tonight  you'll have to wait   you will not deny me  i'm saving myself for tomorrow    will everyone be there   who would dare to miss it   how about your son   it seems a shame not to have met him   that's arthur   poor child   hmm  poor child   it can't have been easy to grow up without a mother   no  hmm   that bond between mother and son    it's so hard to replace   hasn't been easy  i'm sure   perhaps if you found someone   if you remarried    i'm sure you'd have the pick of any maiden in the kingdom   well  perhaps i'll find love again   but i'm afraid it's too late to replace arthur's mother   yes  it's certainly too late for arthur    merlin   merlin            merlin    merlin    merlin    merlin       where are you   i'm here   how small you are for such a great destiny   why  what do you mean   what destiny   your gift  merlin  was given to you for a reason   so there is a reason   arthur is the once and future king  who will unite the land of albion   right     but he faces many threats from friend and foe alike   what's this have to do with me   everything   without you  arthur will never succeed   without you  there will be no albion   no  no  you've got this wrong   there is no right or wrong   only what is and what isn't   if anyone wants to kill him     none of us can choose our destiny  merlin   and none of us can escape it   no  no way  no   there must be another arthur because this one's an idiot   perhaps it's your destiny to change that   wa    wait  wait  stop   i need to know more     hoy   have you seen the state of this room   i      it just happens  by magic   yeah  yes   well  you can clear it up without magic   then get me some herbs   henbane  wormwood and sorrel   and deliver this to morgana   girl's suffering from nightmares     i know the feeling   you know  i've been thinking about arthur   i wouldn't touch him with a lance pole   pass me that dress  will you  gwen   i mean  the man's a total jouster   just because i'm the king's ward   that doesn't mean i have to accompany him to the feast  does it   well  does it  mm mm   if he wants me to go  then he should invite me   he hasn't  know what that means  mm mm   where are you  here   it means i'm going by myself   i need some help with this fastening   gwen  i'm here     so  it's whether i wear this little tease       or give them a night they'll really remember       lady helen  the compliments of the king   come in   so sweet   how will i ever repay him   hearing you sing will be more than enough  won't it   i'm really looking forward to the performance   so am i   i love singing  i sing all the time   my betrothed says i have the voice of a fallen angel         god have mercy   merlin  remember you're here to work   she looks great  doesn't she   some people are born to be queen  no   i hope so  one day   not that i'd want to be her  who'd want to marry arthur   i thought you liked tough  save the world men   no  i like ordinary men like you   gwen  believe me  i'm not ordinary   no  i didn't mean you   obviously  not you   but just   you know  i like much more ordinary men   like you   thanks       we have enjoyed 20 years of peace and prosperity   it has brought the kingdom and myself many pleasures   but few can compare with the honour of introducing  lady helen of mora                     you saved my boy's life   a debt must be repaid  oh     don't be modest  you'll be rewarded   you don't have to   no  absolutely  this merits something quite special   well     you'll get a post in the royal household   you shall be prince arthur's manservant   father       seems you're a hero   hard to believe  isn't it  no   i knew from the moment i met you   you saved my life  remember   but   that was magic   now it seems we've finally found a use for it   what do you mean  you saved arthur   perhaps that's its purpose    my destiny   indeed   this book was given to me when i was your age   but i have a feeling it will be of more use to you  than it was to me   but this is a book of magic   which is why you must keep it hidden   i will study every word     merlin  prince arthur wants you now   your destiny's calling  find out what he wants
