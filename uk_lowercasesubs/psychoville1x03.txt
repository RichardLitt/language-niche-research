become quite faddish of late  amongst trendy young couples  like yourselves   they roll around on space hoppers   listening to dvbs  of dolphin music and burning those candles that smell of germolene   but in my experience   when you feel the stab of that first contraction   you're gonna beg  to be brought onto the ward  flat on your back and numb from the neck down   isn't it more comforting for the baby  to pass from the womb into an environment  which is also warm and wet   less stressful   i see that dr miriam stoppard has snuck back in   hello miriam  how's tom   oh  no  sorry  of course  he left you  didn't he  for felicity kendall   if what you're actually asking is    joy  will a water birth stop it from hurting     well  i'm afraid my answer would have to be no  it won't   because you don't get one of these without a lot of pain   and believe me  mums and dads     i know pain    what's this for  then   do you catch the baby in it   there's one that got away  come in  number three  your time's up   no  that's what we call the stink net   if you're pushing down with all your might   a baby isn't the only thing that'll pop out   so dad   if you allow your partner to choose a water birth   it will be your job to scoop out all the tots   excuse me   joy  your husband's on the phone  he wants you to come home straight away   i can take over here if you like   no  thank you  nicola  i think we're done  thank you   david  stop playing with your food   don't want it   come on  it's good sausage  is that   what's the matter  is it too big   need it mushing up    police want

lucky he went under that bus   or else he'd have gone to the police   did anyone else apart from him see you do that murder   him  him and her   that's three more witnesses we've got to get rid of   plus the two you've already killed  that makes five   can we not do six   why   six makes us proper serial killers  five's just mass murder   you're never satisfied  are you  david   we'll have to see
