   1 almost two million people are brought before england's criminal courts every year   the drugs that were found up in the loft were not yours   your fingerprints won't be on them  will they  absolutely not  no  ok   more than half of them are legally aided   their lawyers paid by the taxpayer   he did spit in my face  so i spat in his face   britain's busiest legal aid practice is tuckers   they handle thousands of these cases every year   we've spent 12 months filming with them   gaining access to the privileged relationship  between lawyer and client   were you  like  interested in him romantically or what   i certainly wasn't interested in him romantically   there's a great difference in age between us  for a start   if you did plead not guilty  i don't think you'd win it   simply because you've got 22 previous convictions for burglary   at a time when the legal system's under increasing scrutiny   this is how justice really works   i just wanted to go out for a beer   the courts  what the judge said    don't  like  speak any more cos it's not a private conversation for you there  because they can hear what you're saying   alex templar  he's one of our clients   he was arrested at seven o'clock last night  it's now two o'clock in the afternoon   it's a burglary   just sit tight  rest assured that i am on the case  ok   and i suspect that you will be interviewed within the next hour   so just sit tight and don't do anything silly  and don't be interviewed without us  right  promise me   shab aslam is the lawyer sent to alex templar   we get told very little before we go out to a job   the basics  really  it's a burglary   i think we are aware it's a non dwelling burglary   which means it's not a house  it's possibly commercial premises   a garage or something like that    unusually  a camera is being allowed in to film the client interview   shab gets the details of the burglary from the police   his client has been arrested in an office block   hi  alex  hi  are you all right  yeah   within your client's rucksack  the police have found two laptops  which are believed to have been stolen from one or both of the premises   in addition  you are believed to have been identified as entering salford university campus  at approximately three o'clock on the same day   a report's been received that a mobile phone has been stolen around that time  from one of the buildings   i'm not getting bail out of here  am i  it's not looking good at the moment   it's not looking good  cos you've got quite an extensive record with the police  for similar type of offences   if you did plead not guilty  i don't think you'd win it   simply because you've got 22 previous convictions for burglary   alex offers shab an explanation for his predicament   ok  yeah  i want to tell you something  between me and you   right  i took nothing  here's what it is   tell me which way do you think we should go  ok   here's what happened  i took a loan out from a loan shark   this is a mistake i made  he's given me a   300 loan   i'm supposed to pay him back on that loan every week   yesterday  now  right  i've called him  right   see  right  the day before i've called him   he says  come on down  let's have a beer  really nicely  i didn't think nothing of it   when i got there  he says 'what do you take me for  a  mug   you think you can take my money and not pay me '  him and his cousin were there  they grab me  push me up against the wall   he says 'listen  you had better pay me my  money or i'll slice your throat '  this is why i'm between a rock and a hard place  i just had to do it  ok   shab knows he's in for a long night in longsight   good morning  tuckers   criminal legal aid costs the taxpayer a billion pounds a year   tuckers handles more of these cases than anyone else   why are you not coming into manchester  now  is that definite   franklin sinclair runs the manchester office   everybody  on the face of it  is against our client   the police are against him  he feels the court's against him  the prosecutor's against him   he thinks the judge is against him  so  we're the only friend   we're there to support them  to explain everything to them  and we're there to help them as best as we can  and so we have to make them feel like we're on their side    just read a file of a client we're going to see   vera kennedy and her daughter joanne hume   both charged with possession of a very large amount of amphetamine  with intent to supply it   she's a regular in that when she gets into trouble she always asks for us   she's normally in court with her husband  and she did appear with him last year and he got sent to prison for supplying drugs   she got a suspended sentence and  of course  now if she's found guilty of this new allegation   she's in breach of her suspended sentence and she's the oldest drug dealer in town   smile  you're on candid camera   oh  dear   nice and slim  you  aren't you  well  i'm not bad   you knew me when i was a lot fatter  didn't you  you weren't fat  i was   i was quite chubby  in the '90s  when i started dealing with you   vera's husband terry has just been released from jail   but now vera's in big trouble   now  this is the most serious position we've ever had you in  i know   eight months prison sentence  wasn't it  yes  suspended   and if you're convicted of this  you're in breach of it   i mean  how's your health at the moment  still the same  it's not good   not good  no   we got a lot of medical reports last time  didn't we  yeah   this time the judge may say  'well  we heard that last time   and we can treat her in jail ' yeah  well     you know  they may do  jail would be tough for you  you're 63  aren't you   yeah  jeez   what you need to know is this  the police came  searched the property  and there's lots of powder in different places  right   all over  literally  there's stuff in the kitchen   they're not bothered about that  i know you're not bothered about that   no  they weren't  no  they're not but the key thing is  in the loft  is three containers of white powder   and that white powder is  first of  and secondly  it's    it's quite high purity   and they're valuing it at   28 000 and we have scales  obviously  as well   with traces of caffeine and a clear tupperware box   that had about a gram's worth in  that was in the freezer   tupperware box in the freezer   we go to the police station  and correct me if i'm wrong  shab advised you to make no comment   but you don't  do you  i don't make no comment   you have  you've made plenty of comment  you said  'first of all  it's both of ours'  and then you said  'no  it's just mine'  you were then asked about the money  and you said it was rebates from council tax and rent that you got   then you were asked about the drugs from the loft   you said it was amphetamine that was yours  for your own personal use   you said it had been up there for six months  to keep it cool   and it says here 'she stated that she was physically able to get into the loft '  it's a typing error  isn't it  i did say i could get up there   did you say you could  yeah  yeah  but you've never tried   i've never been up there  ever  no  you couldn't get up there   i think what we'll do is  after the committal   we'll get you in the office  yeah   and discuss some options  now that you're out  now that you're out   i don't think there's a lot you can do  to me  anyway   there's nothing they can do to you  there's nothing they can do to you   no  you've done your time  you've done your time  and this was discovered whilst you were serving a prison sentence  yeah   don't worry  we'll have you in tunisia as soon as you can breathe   you need a bit of sun  that's what you need   i know  and so do i  i've got that prison tan on me   i know   i'll catch you again  right  all the best  terence  take care  see you   the victims of crime in manchester include two famous faces   wayne rooney and his wife coleen   it all started when coleen went to a concert at the manchester arena   her camera went missing and with it hundreds of private family photos   i'll buy or sell tickets     the crime generated huge publicity   three people are now charged with demanding   5 000  for the return of the pictures   one of them is a tuckers client  steven malcolm   iain johnstone is his lawyer   he's one of the firm's most experienced advocates   his assistant is lisa paton   the situation is  if you take into account  the whole of the circumstances  it does amount to blackmail   iain and lisa are about to meet their client   to advise him whether he should plead guilty or not guilty   what do you think he should do  it's one of those ones which could  literally   boil down to who likes wayne rooney and who doesn't   you in a world of your own  love  hello  lisa  all right  how are you  darling   super  good  good   steven malcolm is a 42 year old handyman  with a history of petty crime   but he's adamant it was his boss who'd got hold of the rooney pictures and dreamt up the blackmail plot   so he borrowed your phone once or twice  yeah   started when you got your phone back and that's the first time  you had any involvement in it and you didn't know what was going on then   this is about thursday    thursday afternoon   so i finished work round about five o'clock thursday   goes to the local pub  have a few drinks   goes home  starts making tea  it was round about eight o'clock  something like that   the next minute  gets a phone call  don't know who it is  hello  and that's how it started   steven says his mobile phone had been used by his boss  lee platt   to start the blackmail negotiations   he went along with it because he was tipsy   so  i phones lee up  'lee  this guy's on the phone   don't know who he is  what's going on here '  'all right  yeah  yeah  tell him we've got these images  and i want five grand for it ' so  next minute  i hangs up   this guy rings me back  oh  hello  yeah   erm    yeah  my boss says he wants five grand  simple as   'right  ok  then  meet you down at the marriott hotel at half past two the next day '  steven  why didn't you  at any stage in those phone calls   say 'listen  mate  got nowt to do with me  speak to my boss  here's his number'  and give him lee's number for him to then ring direct   i never thought about that at the time  i just    don't know   but then why then agree to sort of like be a party to the delivery and set up     yeah  but you've got to understand  right  i work for him  yeah   he assures me that 'you're not going to get arrested   it's a gentleman's agreement  it's all above board '  and so i'm thinking  well  ok  so that particular day i hadn't got a care in the world   it was when steve delivered the images to the marriott hotel the following day  that he was arrested by undercover police   doesn't matter what you say about the negative sort of side of it   i'm pleading not guilty  anyway  we're duty bound and we have to tell you  steven   that if you was to plead guilty you'd get credit for that guilty plea  yeah   i can't say it would mean you definitely staying out as opposed to going to prison   but there is a possibility it could make that difference   we can say to the judge  'without prejudice  judge  our client's pleading not guilty   but he would like to know  with respect   what is the worst you would do if he pleaded guilty '  it would be nice if you ask him  right  and see where we go from there   at longsight police station  shab aslam is still dealing with alex templar  arrested for burglary   alex is desperate to get out of the police station on bail   but he's forgotten the phone numbers of two people who might help him   what happens next is a shock for shab   i'm going to give you the two people's names  yeah  i'm going to do something     i don't know if i should be doing this  go on   right   i've got a phone  but it's my phone  it's not no stolen phone  right   i don't know if you want to show this on the     no  i don't think you should show it  alex  but tell me  go on   right  there's two people i would like you to call  right   i have their numbers on the thing  that's why i have to pull it out   one of them  right  is sarah   listen  listen     i don't know if you should be showing it on camera  you know   i don't really want to go back in there with it   you can't give it to me  alex   alex  you do know that you'd get into a lot of trouble for having that phone   well  that's too bad  that's too bad  you know   did you have it in your pocket and they didn't find it   they just didn't find it  this is my phone   prisoners in custody are forbidden to have a phone   it puts us in a difficult position  we've got to advise him to hand the phone over   otherwise we'd be party to him possibly perverting the course of justice   so we have to be quite straightforward and say  look  alex   you have to hand that over to the police   if you get arrested with that or they find it later and you're making phone calls from your cell   you're going to be in a lot more trouble   alex templar handed in the phone   he eventually pleads guilty to burglary and receives a 12 month prison sentence   from their returning clients   the clientele's very mixed  there's the kind of sad drug addicted ones   there's the alcoholic ones  there's ones with mental problems   and then there are people who  i suppose   you could say have a bit of an attitude   and are easily disturbed  quite volatile   monday morning  the lawyers who cover the police stations  have been summoned to the office   right  guys  thanks for coming  a bit of an impromptu meeting   i let you know on friday that i wanted you to come in   essentially  just to put everybody at ease  nobody's losing their job   thank goodness for that  ok   no one's getting a bollocking   tuckers earned   10 million in legal aid last year   but the government is cutting these fees   so law firms need to bring in even more clients   each police station client brings the firm   180   the fees mount up if the case goes to court   times are really  really hard at the moment   i'm on the marketing team and i go to a lot of the management meetings   we are    we need more quantity  mm   ok  we need shoplifters  we need repeat offenders   the thing is  we can do all the marketing in the world  and we can write to clients and we can have these gizmos and gadgets   when we've got someone at the police station  we need to keep them   that is a fixed fee  that is your client   that is someone that's going to have a mags case and a crown case   and so when we've got 'em we need to be concentrating on the ones we've actually got   they're the ones that are at least asking for us  get loads of clients  loads of co accused   in the rooney blackmail case  it's time for steven malcolm to make his plea   he's been waiting to see if the judge is likely to give a reduced sentence for a guilty plea   but the judge doesn't say   so his lawyer tries to strike a deal with the prosecution   but steven gets angry with this plea bargaining process  and goes off to the pub   iain tracks him down   right  they've decided they will accept our basis of plea  and we've persuaded them to drop the handling charge  as well   to bring it down to one count   erm    on the basis that you were just acting as an employee   but you have been actively involved  to a degree   where you've crossed the line  basically   where are you at the moment   calm down now   i don't think he's got the willpower to control that behaviour   and if he kicked off like that in front of a jury   it wouldn't go down very well   steven finally leaves the pub and returns to court   all i wanted to do was just go for a beer   i went with my mate  yeah  i just went for a beer    the courts  what the judge said   i just wanted to go out  i even bought headache tablets   i was stressed out  do you know what i mean   i've had    i've took four of them at the minute   and i've got to go back in here    and see what my outcome is   his boss  who steven blames for the blackmail plot  pleads guilty   the court then asks steven malcolm how he pleads   his lawyers advice had been to plead guilty and avoid a trial   but it's not what happens   in my mind i just wanted to plead not guilty  all the way   cos i know what happened on the events   and all right  for a lesser sentence and plead guilty   erm    in my eyes  why should i   so steven malcolm will face a full trial for blackmailing coleen rooney   it's christmas in manchester   at strangeways prison  gary cox has spent four days on remand   he's an accountant  he's also a convicted sex offender   and he's now charged with harassing his former victim   tuckers have just managed to get him bail   i wasn't aware that anything was happening   but just very grateful that it's happened and that i've got bail   i don't live in the manchester area and i need to stay away from here   i need to stay at my parents' house as a condition of my bail  every night   three weeks after christmas  trainee lawyer  jonathan enston   is off to see gary cox   two years ago  gary got a community order for sexually assaulting a young man   and was later convicted of harassing him   he now faces a fresh charge of harassing the same man   were you  like  interested in him romantically  no   i certainly wasn't interested in him romantically   there's a great difference in age between us   so  how old is he  cos i know   he's 20 now   yeah  18   so there was clearly quite a difference in age between us  that obviously i was very aware of  and so  you know   even if i was interested it was a non starter because of the age difference   he's very good looking  he's very intelligent  he's very confident   you know  he could basically have a relationship with whoever he wanted   gary is accused of following the young man one night at salford quays   gary says he was actually there to gather evidence  to appeal against his previous conviction for harassment   he says that he then decided to hang around that area to feed the ducks   so  tell me about feeding the ducks   tell me    i know  it sounds     i know it sounds so ridiculous  'quackers'  absolutely   i couldn't put it better myself  when i used to live in manchester   i had occasionally gone to salford quays   i knew there were a load of geese and whatever that winter there   so  you know  i had fed them there before   so  i thought while i was in the area   i'd walk down and there were usually a few ducks and geese around  and there were loads and loads  dozens of them  this night   so i was down there feeding them for quite some time and obviously     you didn't see anyone  i saw one or two people walk past  but  you know  didn't pay any attention to them  mm hm   too busy   i was just feeding the ducks  to be honest   jonathan heads off to salford quays   he's checking out statements made by the prosecution witnesses   'at the footbridge  between the watersports centre and the beefeater   i noticed gary to my left  he was on the left side of a smaller canal bank '  which i presume is just down there   the prosecution's version of events   that comes from the victim and his brother   is that they are walking this way   i'm walking backwards now     but walking forwards having come from the lowry theatre   gary's informed me  and this is why he wants me to come here   that he was actually over there  by the holiday inn  feeding the ducks   it's about undermining the credibility of the witnesses   that's something that's definitely been improved by coming down today and taking photos   there's a week to go before the start of the rooney blackmail trial   lawyer iain johnstone has had a car accident and broken his leg   he's hobbled into the office for a pre trial meeting with his client   but there's no sign of steven malcolm   hiya  chuck  what are we going to do about mr malcolm's no show   still not here  no  i'll give him till three   has he got a current mobile   permanently switched off and he's not updated us   okey dokey   some people don't seem to care at all about their fate   if it was me  i'd be at my solicitor's office every day   going 'what's new  what can we go through  how can we attack this '  but  obviously  that's me  not everybody is as bothered   friday prayers in a rochdale mosque   among the crowd is one of tuckers' busiest lawyers  asim ali   i go there because it's a sense of community   see people that i wouldn't ordinarily see   clearly  if i'm there and if someone's got a problem   i'm quite happy to speak to people in confidence   and i make no secret of the fact that i am a lawyer  who works in criminal defence   today he has a trial in bury and he's meeting the client at tuckers' local office   nice tan  i know  i've just come back from egypt   i know  did you enjoy yourself  yeah  it were all right   nigel walker is charged with racially aggravated assault   he took a cab home one night in rochdale   the police say he attacked the asian taxi driver   nigel says the taxi driver attacked him and nigel had been the one who'd called the police   we'll say to him the reason he's not rang the police is because he was the aggressor   the court's going to say to you  you were drinking from three till about midnight   so  that's quite a few hours  that  to be drinking   we'd only had eight pints through the day  we'd had our dinner   and i take it eight pints isn't a lot for you to drink   not really  not carling   were you probably merry but not on your way   no  i mean  it's impossible to get drunk off carling   is it  it is  yeah   you said that the driver was talking about american foreign policy  and didn't seem to be happy about you being drunk   so  was he going on about the way they interfere with other countries   i was trying to have a conversation with my friend and the taxi driver's interfering  and trying to make conversation with me and my mate what was in the taxi   what were you talking about  me and my friend  mm   er    just day to day things what had gone on in the town and that   now  you say he spat in your face  and did you tell the police that   er    i can't remember  ok   he did spit in my face  so i spat in his face   you denied you were being racist  throughout   cos you don't really have any problems with people   not really  i might have been a bit racist  when he cut my hand in the kitchen when the police officers turned up   if they believe you  then you'll be acquitted  yeah   if they don't believe you  then unfortunately you'll be convicted   that's how it works  it just works on who they believe on the day   with these type of cases   the trial is being held at bury magistrates court   nigel's fate hangs on whether asim can undermine the witness for the prosecution   the taxi driver was a young asian chap   the way he put forward his account was thoroughly unconvincing   he went so far as to deny some of the things he'd admitted in his witness statement   and the key fact is in his witness statement he admitted to having a screwdriver  and waving this at mr walker   but in court he denied he had anything in his hand at all   with the main witness changing his story  asim asks the magistrates to drop the case   well  nigel  cheers  that was a good result  hard earned   the court  obviously  having heard what he had to say  and the police officers   they felt that they couldn't believe what he said   and he obviously tripped up about the knife screwdriver part  yeah   so  a good result  yeah  trust you won't get in trouble again   no  i won't  no  all right  so  take care   you've got my number if you need anything  yep   very happy how the case went  it's been hard in that i've had a few arguments with my girlfriend   because she wasn't sure whether i was telling the truth   yeah  i don't like going to courts  you know what i mean   it can be a bit intimidating  er     because they try discrediting you  making you out to be the liar   which wasn't the case   the gary cox case is jonathan's last as a clerk on the magistrates' team   he's just qualified as a solicitor   i think you're going to have a fantastic career  so all the best to you  congratulations   he's due to hand over his notes on this case to trial lawyer caroline wilbraham   but caroline can't find the notes and she's an exacting colleague   just where are the instructions that he's taken  where is everything   why is it not on the file   on the eve of gary cox's trial  the stress is showing   absolutely    if you had my casebook   i've got to do the fucking trial tomorrow   have we got these instructions   gary cox is charged with harassing a younger man he's already sexually assaulted   and caroline rates the prospects for him as pretty bleak   he says that he didn't follow them and they wouldn't  have been able to see him from where they say they are   so there are questions that i can put to the witnesses  but erm    it all depends on t'magistrates but i think the magistrates will find him guilty   it's the morning of gary cox's trial  caroline's finally got the papers as she wanted them   and makes her way to court   her client is less breezy   just trying to keep it together basically   but gary's trial doesn't happen because there aren't any witnesses   unfortunately  the crown prosecution service hadn't prepared their file properly  and they hadn't warned their witnesses to attend   the prosecution want to adjourn the trial to allow the alleged victim to give evidence   but caroline stops that  using a legal manoeuvre   there's a new initiative at the moment that's been implemented from january   called stop delaying justice which essentially means that all cases  should go ahead at the first available opportunity   the magistrates agreed that there was not a good and compelling reason  to adjourn the case on this occasion   so  unfortunately for the prosecution service   the magistrates ordered that the trial go ahead today  in which case  because the prosecution witnesses weren't here   there's no evidence that the crown can offer in respect of the charge  and so the charge has been dismissed   something at last has gone right in my case   so for it finally to get dismissed was very good news and a huge relief for the family  as well   i can fully understand that  with the case being dropped   the alleged victims may feel a little aggrieved at that   you know  at the end of the day  they've made a complaint about somebody  for something they believe has taken place and it's been dropped   you know  if somebody is guilty  it's not up to me to prove that   it's up to the prosecution to prepare their case  and if the client is guilty  they should be able to prove that through the evidence   the media are out in force on the opening day of the coleen rooney blackmail trial   iain johnstone has heard nothing from his client   he's not even sure steven malcolm will show up   i'm hoping that the court'll open reasonably early  so that i can get in and get changed in court   hello  hiya  are you all right   what have you done  i've bust my knee  oh  aye   so  where have you been hiding  we've written to you and tried ringing you  yeah  i know   to get you in to go through it all  yeah  but i feel it is  up to you   yeah  i feel that there's nothing to discuss   cos on the last visit  you're telling me i virtually had to plead guilty   so why should i come into your office to discuss things   you tell me that  because i can tell you the sort of questions  that the prosecution are going to try and put to you   if i plead not guilty  yeah  right   but you're coming across on the last visit   this is what i'm trying to say to you   to plead guilty   so why should i come in and see you  are you all right   because what i said to you last time  steven  was   you're sitting on a very fine line  yeah  course i am   you're sitting on a very fine line and it all boils down to  really   your knowledge of what the prosecution can show   the prosecution can show  obviously  that you were instrumental in the drop   and that you had telephone contact with the undercover officer the night before   and really that's their case   that you're associated with platt  that you were doing his running for him  and that you knew what it was about  tell you what i'll do  right   hurry up  cos i'm losing my patience with these    so  hurry up and we'll go in court cos these fuckers here   i can see them standing there   so  just waiting for lisa to turn up   the trial gets underway and on day one at least   steven malcolm's feeling confident   i feel good at the minute because i knew from the start  i was pleading not guilty   and at the minute i'm feeling pretty good  yeah   so  i'm just going for a beer  i need a beer   on day two of the trial  steven's opting for a suit   by pleading not guilty  he's hoping to avoid prison altogether   but he's been warned that if he's convicted   he'll pay for it with a longer sentence   he insists his family makes the gamble worthwhile   my oldest daughter  joanne  i only got in contact with her  three    three    three years and a few months     and i've got a bond with joanne   when she turns up  i always make sure that the heating's on   there's food in the cupboard  the duvet's always changed   nice and fresh for her   i get on here  so in the morning  it's hectic  because she's using the shower and i'm  like  knocking on t'door   'are you finished ' 'no ' right  all right   it's just like a dad thing that i've missed for so many years   and    i don't want to lose that   it's day three of the trial   steven's about to give evidence and he's given up on the suit   i'm thinking to myself  hang on a minute  the jury take me as i am   and the circumstances surrounding this case   so  i shouldn't have to come here to make an impression and put a tie on   after today  as soon as i've been questioned   it all gets a little bit easier   up to this point  steven malcolm's line has been  that he didn't realise what he was involved in was wrong or illegal   on the stand  he changes his tune   what he in fact said was  he did realise it was wrong   and he realised it was illegal  at that point the prosecutor said   'in that case  mr malcolm  why are we all here '  i was quite sad  really  watching him  being cross examined in the way that he was   he was clearly struggling with his answers   i think she ran rings round him but i think a lot of it  as well  with him was   not necessarily sure he really understood what was going on   it was though he was lost   his lawyers tell steven he's left with no option but to change his plea to guilty   the judge accepts steven's plea and says he'll sentence him after christmas   feel a bit shit at the minute so i'm going to go home   yeah    what more can i say   so erm    see you in january   i feel completely deflated and if i was going to say anything about it   and i don't pass comment very often  that's why we have pre trial conferences   they are our clients and we do what they instruct us to do   if they don't want to follow advice  that's a matter for them   how are you  not bad  haven't seen you for ages   vera kennedy  the oldest drug dealer in town   turns up at the office for a meeting with franklin   hi  good afternoon  hiya   and how are you  my love  good afternoon  terence   they need to work out how she's going to plead  when she appears in court the following week   lisa's here  as well  because lisa did your last case  and did a very good job  as she always does   she's here  she's brilliant   the situation is complicated because vera admitted to the offence at the police station   when we last discussed the case  you were telling us  that in reality the drugs that were found up in the loft were not yours   although you actually admitted to them at the police station   but in fact you said at the police station that you could get into the loft   can you get into the loft  no   is it impossible for her  impossible  absolutely impossible   and if we have to   never been in it  never  never been in it   she wouldn't fit   he's very flattering  isn't he  he knows how to flatter a woman   it's a small gap  i wouldn't get through it   did you know they were there or not   so  you didn't know they were there and your fingerprints won't be on them  will they   absolutely not  no  ok   can you explain the position with regard to those drugs that were found around the house   the freezer  the living room  etc   it's just what we all have  we all have amphetamine  all of us  all my lot   you take it and to help pay for that and also to help pay for a debt   i'm right in saying that whilst terry's been in prison  have you been selling it  as well  yeah  right  ok   so  because of that  vera's going to have to enter a guilty plea  to possession of drugs with intent to supply  ok   vera is already on a suspended prison sentence   so if she pleads guilty  it means she'll almost certainly go to jail   i'm anxious to avoid a contested   any kind of hearing   i think that vera is such a     well  she's such a nice lady   she'll agree with the nice prosecution barrister  and he'll go 'isn't it this ' and he'll put a lot of pressure on her  and he'll scare her  you know what i mean  yeah   i tell you what  if we keep you out  that will be an amazing  an amazing result   vera kennedy pleads guilty to supplying drugs   her daughter pleads guilty to possession   they are both currently awaiting sentence   it's been suggested that we profit from our clients' bad behaviour   obviously  in very simple terms  we do   but firstly  let me point out that we are a business  and if we don't make any profit  we won't survive   and there won't be any criminal law firms defending anybody   and  as a senior judge recently said  nobody else protects the vulnerable   as well as criminal lawyers do   it's sentencing day in the coleen rooney blackmail trial   steven malcolm's brief is waiting for him at court   steven malcolm  however  is on the other side of town   in the pub with his mates   i just hope the judge  right     has a heart  do you know what i mean  has a heart   you go to jail  all right  you're privileges  your privileges are all gone   you can't  like  open your front door  open the window   you can't go to the shop  you can't have sex with somebody  you can't spend your money   but it's not going to     it's not going to change me  ok   the only person that's going to change me is my mother   when i come out  right  and i go to my mam's   and mam says  'son  don't do this again  cos it'll break my heart'   this  that  and the other   whatever she says  not the judge  whatever my mam says  goes   not the judge   all you've got to do is treat it like a holiday  treat it like a holiday  do you know what i mean   you'll be all right   his daughter joanne has come along to support him   we come back into contact last year   i'm going to miss you  i'm going to miss you   get over there  erm    april  i was going to london   and i know this is his local  so as i was in the taxi   i was getting on the coach  you know  national express  round the corner   i had 45 minutes to get on my coach to go to london cos i had a hen do on the saturday   i'd seen his little ginger bald head and i thought right  get onto you   'what have you been doing  you naughty boy ' he said it's a long story   i said i'm back from london on sunday  tell me what the script is  exactly what you've done   and we'll go from there  and this is why i'm sat here today   so  all you can do  it's family  you know what i mean   no matter what you've done  what you've caused   blood's thicker than water  so    so what more can i do   yeah  yeah   you'll be all right  dad  mm   it'll be ok  yeah  course it will  course it will   mr malcolm     mr malcolm   don't want to know  don't want to know   go   there's no need for that  we've already spoke to the bleeding tv people   there's no need  i'm his daughter  there's no need   the judge describes steve malcolm as a willing accomplice and sentences him to 20 months in jail   that's just four months less than the main blackmailer  malcolm's boss   i think the sentence was too high   the distinction between them of four months was  on the face of it  not enough   perhaps he should have kept his appointments when he had them   for some bizarre reason  some people seem to think they know better  than i do  as to the correct way to proceed with things   and obviously  in mr malcolm's case  he didn't know the correct way to proceed with things
