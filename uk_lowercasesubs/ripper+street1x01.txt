the left carotid   was the stroke left or right   like the others   and these are    these are stars  aren't they   and the eyelids slit apart   catherine eddowes and mary jane kelly had the same   and the writing on the wall   like goulston street the night we found miss eddowes' apron   the same words as was in that letter   what    what is that   some kind of gelatine   what kind   from a meat pie  what   how am i to know yet   don't you have evidence to collect   i know it's tempting  but try not to kill him   mr reid  sir   i'm hearing strange rumours  oh  yes   that there's an unregistered female on the premises   always an abundance of those  sergeant   i'm not here to judge you  sir   just to remind you of our obligations under the law   why  thank you for that  artherton  as always   creighton  open up   this one   he dragged the body through the archway   those   oh  i over exposed them   worth our while to check   do you think me some bone headed flatfoot  they need more time   professional man like yourself  i would have thought you'd know better   that's the same wall   where's the message  creighton   the writing on the wall   down on whores    was it you painted it up there   you know who it was   best   i just record what i see   get that to press  quick sharp   how do you think they felt  those girls   the moment they knew that was it  that breathing this air was up   hmm  the later ones   they would have known what that lunatic intended for their bodies   do you have a pity for them   do you have a pity for the many men you've ruined with your accusations   i have    i have never accused  i have asked questions   i have speculated   speculate  well  i speculate about you  best   the hand that penned that letter   a letter i never credited as bona fide   and now   this   what else did you alter   nothing  yeah  well  i didn't have to  did i   just underlined what's plain to a man who's as intimate with  the ripper's doings as myself   well  myself and chief inspector abberline   you spoke to fred abberline   your boss  as was  i have  yes   and he finds himself in agreement with me   our friend is back   nothing's for certain  i won't have people hiding in their homes again   till i get to certain  if i see this in print  i'll be back here for some ripping of my own   oo ooh   who do you think you are  reid   what  you come here to rattle me when you forget what i know of you   oh  no  do not fear  good citizens  do not shake   for sleepless  tireless detectives reid and abberline   hunt our jack down dockside and rookery   two finer police the world has not yet made   so be of good heart  this maniac will be brought to ground and hard   only  erm     oh  yeah  no  he    he wasn't  was he   the man and his works abide   friday  all right   unless you've got something proves it's another knifeman     this story turns over on friday   ah  inspector  i know  i know  artherton   it's not that  sir  what   our past has come to say how do   chief inspector abberline  what merits such a visit   enough dancing  detective   if there's a diced up girl in this shop  she's mine   out   how could you do this  this is my shop now   this is my case  i know what this looks like   look    look  this graffito   this is best's contrivance  look at her   her eyes  the stars on her face  her guts   her abdomen was opened fresh  right here  as part of the autopsy  conducted by homer jackson   that yankee clap doctor   the man was a us army surgeon and he was a pinkerton  pinkerton   that's right  a chartered mercenary with a badge   and you place his word above mine   i think you would have her ripper above all else   another bite  another chance at him   but you would not   i would have my innards served to me cold  if i thought it would show him to us but  fred  what if     what if this girl was dressed as jack for our eyes   and in our fervour  we fill the streets with uniform hunting for him  and miss the truth of it  now let me bring my mercenary  back in here and have him speak   the fact he didn't open her up strikes as strange   their guts  it's what he always wanted the most   to open them up and see the viscera in his hand   then he was caught short  as he was with elizabeth stride   her throat was cut  the rest of her untouched   but if he was disturbed with this one  he went back to her   or he hid beside her   but whichever  he waited some few hours before bringing her here   so long  in fact  that all the blood had ceased to spill from her body   you see these cuts and gashes in her throat   no blood on the road she was dragged across   i doubt there'd have been much where they opened her  either   when the woman's throat was cut  the throat is a post mortem injury   then what did for her   asphyxia   her hyoid bone is broken   so she was strangled  and all else happened after   these slits in her eyes and her face   with kelly and eddowes  they were a postscript  an afterthought   this girl  they're top billing   this is theory  not proof   get proof  if you cannot  i'll pull rank and claim her   what else   well  despite your friend best's connivery   she had been serviced  recently and vigorously   so she was a tart  no  i don't think so   see  i place her no younger than 28   her skin  nail beds  the essential health of her    apparatus   by that age even the more costly are worn through   so  if she wasn't a professional   my guess     the lady taught fiddle   yeah  she lived to the north  the new suburbs   has the pinkerton been conferring with spirits   enough  sergeant  go on   here  beneath her chin   you see this moon like impression in the clavicle  her fingers     worn and puckered by strings   and her hair  there are heavy deposits in it   soot   from the underground railway   which arrives  drake  i believe  from which direction   finchley  highgate  crouch end  missing persons reports   can't be too many lady violinists   just a warning  sir  it may take some time   the type printing telegraphs you ordered     what of them  they're faster   so it is said    reid   you have a type printer   hobbs  you were instructed  were you not   yes  inspector  well  it's a bit of a handful   come on  boy  this is the future   the lad might come to terms with it sooner  sir   if you weren't stood so close   and that  reid  is the human barrier to progress   i'm home to change  you need to rest  too   captain jackson   the tonic you took from her thighs   have you wondered whether it might not be some kind of silver solution   from a peeper's dry plate   emily   have you been to church   i am home for a shirt   and now you go back   it cannot be helped  of course   there is a particular reason why i must return   has he come  i don't know   i don't know  it might be   please don't go out after nightfall   i'll get word to you if i'm to be gone all night   i don't want you to worry  i know   no   send the runner to mr reid   he'll be taking the metropolitan  finchley's missing a violinist   johnson   it's the call to send them underground that troubles me  sir   seems unnatural   well  they're building more  more trains  digging more tunnels   it means the city can spread out and we can stop living like rats   what  and come live on these streets   would you like that  bennet   i'd like many things  sir   is this it     mr thwaites  sir  it's the police   drake  drake  i cannot hold him   what did reid want   weren't you taught to knock   the day you pay rent  jackson  i'll knock   is that maniac on the strut again   who  reid   relax  darlin'  you need to start frisking men for knives again   i'll let you know  now     any of the girls get their picture taken   is this what brought reid here   jackson  that man could ruin us   he wants my help  what am i supposed to do   you tell him sorry  but you're indisposed   fine  but he'll ask himself why   and me and you  we don't want that   you stop lavishing your care and attention on him   coming here was your idea   when we came here  you said this was the kind of lawless shit swarm  that we could hide ourselves in and you were right   but  darling  in case you haven't noticed  we're not hiding anymore   we live here  now  if that man wants to make a friend of me   he is welcome   cos if he ain't a friend  he's an enemy  and an enemy like that  we do not need   so  please  which of the girls has a leaning to smut   myrtle   get rose up here   you can keep 'em if you like  i may   where'd you get these done  rose   two men boarded a coach with some toff   trimmed whiskers  moustache   mr thwaites  these men  they put you up there   and the man sergeant drake describes  do you know him   were you here to talk about maud  my wife   sir  you should prepare yourself   whatever the outcome  it may be safer for you to remain with us a while   mr thwaites  until we find those men   and i would apologise for where i have been forced to lay her   she will be moved as soon as circumstance allows   oh  maud   this is it   queen of sheba   little bo peep   boadicea  queen of the britons   rose   s'all right  perce  he's with me   thinking of joining up  ain't you   business good   never better  so long as we don't get copped   and find the right distribution   rosie here'll be lighting them up in blackpool   sarah bernhardt and i shall be one of a piece   you already are  rose   you already are   don't you get cold out here   wouldn't know  never been out here before   we have her name   we know how she was killed  and nothing else   what does he want   your lead  inspector  your notion about the dry plates   and this relates how   and we have this  too   it's more  er     evolved   that's disgusting   it's disgustingly remunerative   the act itself  reid  that's the future of smut   maud thwaites was caught up in this   it would fit   no streetwalker  but so recently and energetically squired   the gelatine from a photographer's plate on her thigh   i am in your debt   you tell me which scratch drake has taken his fall in tonight     i'll consider it paid   you've no right to ask me this thing   i fear i have every right  sir   your wife's body bears the signs of recent intimacy and i need to know if  that intimacy was shared with yourself  of course it was   mr thwaites  why do you think those men chose to string you up  like they did   i've told you  i have no idea who they were   no  i mean  there was trouble taken to make it appear  self slaughter  as if driven by guilt or shame   in any event  they wanted your silence   but just what is it they were feared you might speak of   what shame  mr thwaites   this shame  did your wife have pictures taken like this   how far and how openly did your wife share her    intimacy   everything she did     she did for us   for me   so that my pride might not be ruined   when i found her  she lived near here  in whitechapel   she used to play for the children of the orphanage  on criterion street  from where i hoped to deliver her   my church group  we raise supplies for a number  of poor schools in the borough   i loved her immediately   before i married her  however     she confessed to a certain     practicality   but  as you say  you delivered her  i did   i promised her comfort and dignity     pupils to be taken in her own home  and she deceived you   no  sergeant   the deception was mine   my     employment was not as secure as i thought   i had no grounds to promise her those things   her home  even her violin   i mortgaged it all   and so she returned to whitechapel   where did she go  i don't know   who did she go to  i don't know   mr thwaites  it's unwise to rile him   you think you can hurt me   here  when my most profound wish is that those men had  succeeded in their task   can't you see  inspector  that i am the last person  who would ever know about the things that she did because   as far as i was concerned     it wasn't happening  at all   what do you think   she was never ripper  that girl   that killer prospers by this radical smut   you really don't think it could have been the husband  sir   the shame is too much  he follows her  kills her   he'd need lodgings  somewhere to work on her  no   well  sergeant  like it or not   joseph smeaton must draw us away a while   are you fit and able  yes  sir   don't fight it  pull on   this scratch is over  corner   come to  gentlemen  fifth scratch   he ain't got to deal with it for too much longer now  does he   thought you said he could be trusted  hey   do the count  do the count  count it  hurry up   ten  nine  eight  seven  six  five   four  three  two  one   come and get your winnings  here we go   one for you  one for you  sir     leave off  what's going on   joseph smeaton  i am arresting you for the organisation of  and the illicit profiteering from proscribed and rigged fights   put the irons on him   you're blue  buckle me   you need to put the irons on every man jack in east london   they'll be leaving their earnings with someone new by the morning   counterfeit currency  i shall send you down for snide  too  joe   sir   sir  the toff  whiskers  fight     there   best make haste  tucker  yes  sir   if thwaites has anything more to tell us about this man   we are taking it this time  thwaites   oh  no  no  no  no  no  no   find jackson  yes  sir     mr thwaites' particulars  sir  thank you  john   may i   sweet girl   with dark secrets   we've all got secrets  even sergeant drake  here   i would be gentle with sergeant drake  if i were you   he's of a mind to murder someone  and tonight i do not have the strength to     stop him   what do you see   death and corruption  look closer   there's a blemish  a mark on the camera lens  most likely   the same place on each photograph  the same camera   creighton  go on  sergeant   false bottom   you may want to avert your eyes  drake   this is some strong meat   i have her   not much seems to be beyond our maud  does it   hang on  that's him  it's the toff   what is this   look at this  it's all exactly the same  show me   no   creighton   water only inflames it   what kind of fire will not be doused   the door is bolted fast   then all evidence dies here  and all the men who know about it   jackson  sheets  pass me the sheets   clear out the space between the hinges around the door with this   do it  sergeant  cut me some strips   phosphorous  flash powder   what's he doing  the crazy bastard's making guncotton   guncotton    this one in the bottom  of course   come on  back  get back   you're just shanking it  you got to aim right   you just take your time  sir  thank you  sergeant   now what   i see these images all look identical   but by the end of the sequence  the bird sits in a different position   there is a man   a frenchman  le prince  he's an engineer   he has been experimenting with photographic images     that move   like a lantern show  no  real   it's why the pictures appear as a kind  because every  degree of muscular movement has to be captured with precision   so the end effect  therefore  is fluid movement   it is the    it is the precise details of our lives caught  and re presented to us   now what    what if you could make these images move   and be real  you see   you see the leash   enough  perhaps  in a moment of grotesque passion  to break her neck   and what if this entire moment had been captured by this new camera   in the right circles  it would make them a mint   then they'd make more   this man  we must find this man   oh       evening  my ladies  good evening  sir   turkish delight   thank you  sir   mmm   is there someone else in here  sir   no one you need worry about   here  take another

snide  one of yours  i believe   there are mine all over the city   only they're not  arthur donaldson  where is he   what makes you think i know  eh   sincerely  not a great deal  instinct   well  you can take your instinct  and you can shove it up this animal's fundament   curse us   shall we make another     huh   i need light   imagine  a little thing like that come between us and our enrichment   light you shall have     where is donaldson   he lives in mayfair   we know that  he does no longer     i only went there once   well  under our noses  sir   this will calm you     downstairs   donaldson  arthur donaldson   myrtle  myrtle  where is rose   jackson   get the sword  sergeant   drake   argh     does she breathe  sergeant   she does  sir   whatever happens   whatever punishment is seen fit for all this  that is extraordinary     this way   i thought    at last     i thought it was safe again   ssh  now  it is  it is safe now   thank you  drake  i'll tend to her now   hey  rosie  hey     clear the way  lads   the facts   have you lost your mind   why   because it is the truth   and i would have the world know it   she was never ripper  that girl  but you two     you  for profit   you  for guilt  i suspect  wanted it so   now i ask us to undertake this   that we find a little joy in his continued absence   that we cease to look for him  in every act of evil that crosses our path   there is an abundance of that hereabout  and i would have obsession blinker us to the wider world no longer   am i understood   then get out   edmund  this last year  that     lunatic will ever bind me to you   but you ask too much   he lives still  he breathes this air still   these streets demand your vigilance  no   we did everything in our power   used every instrument allowed to us  some that were not   all that we can hope for now is that he is gone and stays gone   he will own my life no more   the men of whitechapel do your job for you  once more  yeah   'he is my prisoner and in my protection '  then at the time of my choosing we will end you all this night
