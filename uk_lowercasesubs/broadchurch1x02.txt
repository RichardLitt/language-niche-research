said you were out at the cliffs   i walked danny's paper round  there's a hut on briar cliff   mile and a half along the coast from where danny's body was found   find out who owns it and the car park below   collect the cctv from the camera there   how're we doing on the house to house   we've got five uniform allocated  two probationers   one who can't drive  and one who'd never taken a statement before   that's all they've given us  it's a summer weekend   you've got three music festivals and two sporting events within 100 miles   so all the officers are attached to them until monday   don't tell the family   uniform are moaning they're having to take calls   we're getting more phone lines put in   clear desk policy end of the day  yeah   soco are at work on the beach  it's gonna be a long one   oh  we're still going through the latimer house   sorry  are you listening   danny's skateboard  danny's mobile  priority   also  main suspects  you know this town  who's the most likely   if the boy was killed before he was left on the beach   where's the murder scene   what are you doing now   we've managed to find a family liaison officer   i'm gonna take him over to the latimers  oh  and jack marshall   owns the paper shop  rang in  he said he'd remembered something   you're welcome   couldn't stop thinking about him    all last night   i help run the sea brigade   danny'd been coming about 18 months  on and off   cheeky lad  but a good heart   it matters  a good heart   you said you remembered something about seeing danny   must have been end of last month   around quarter to eight on a wednesday morning   on the road leading up to the clifftops on the way to linton hill   i saw him  what was he doing   talking to the postman   well      not talking  more like    arguing   he was quite a way away   but the body language was pretty clear   then danny stormed off   the postman was calling after him   you're certain it was the postman   well he had a bag  and one of those high visibility jackets   who else is going to be out that time in the morning   can you describe him for me   he was a long way off   medium height  short brown hair  i think   it was only after you were in yesterday that i remembered   i should've mentioned   erm  they're elimination prints   to rule out your prints from anything we might find here or anywhere else   is this necessary   if she wants us to do it  it's necessary  isn't it   did anyone sleep   no  so  erm  pete will be your family liaison officer   it's his job to keep you up to date with the investigation   answer your questions  or talk about any questions we might have   why can't you do that  no of fence  none taken   it's a very specialised job  pete's just completed his training   yeah  you're my first   but you know us   the best thing i can do is to find who killed danny and i will   when do we start arranging the funeral   that has to wait  i'm afraid   until we have the person responsible in custody  danny's     his body is    oh  god  i'm sorry to talk about it like this    it's the most valuable piece of evidence we have   we can't allow him to be buried until we're sure  we've got the right person and enough evidence to convict them   so we can't have him back  not yet  i'm sorry   he's not evidence  he's my brother  i understand  i really do   give her the piece of paper   we made a list  people who might have done it   oh  right   these are all your friends   we know   ds miller   excuse me     500 in cash  taped to the underside of the bed frame in danny's room   you're kidding   and we found this   cocaine  in the daughter's room   bloody hell   so  tell me about broadchurch   ok  it's the only town for about 20 miles   there's one road in  one road out  market twice weekly     yeah  i've got all that  who lives here   well  a lot have been here all their lives  generations   some of them haven't even been  and then there's the incomers   young families  left cities when they had babies   came here for the schools and the sea   we get tourists in the summer  but we're a working town mainly   much crime  it's mostly theft from lock ups   odd bit of drug use  drink driving  seriously   i do the weekly crime report in the paper with one of the uniforms   about 30 of fences a week  but mostly all are minor   we've never had a murder   and that's the sort of story you do at the echo  yeah   clubs  schools  council meetings   maggie says we celebrate the everyday   and what about you   what do you want   i want to work on a national  i want to be you  basically   well  be careful what you wish for   how come you were here so quick   look  if i'm gonna report on this   i need to understand the town  the people   you help me  and i might be able to help you   what do you think   have you told my mum and dad about the wrap   not yet  please don't  it's not mine   it was in your room  i don't use it  i swear i don't   do you deal it  no   this isn't anything to do with danny  i promise  it was a mistake  a big mistake   if you don't use it or deal it  did someone leave you holding it   and you're protecting that person  it's one tiny wrap   oh  we'll tell your mum that  no  you said you wouldn't   chloe  possession of a class a drug is a criminal of fence   dealing a class a drug is a criminal of fence   i was just passing it on

money   oh  chloe  don't get smart   i don't know anything about any money  i swear   why is becca fisher giving a 15 year old girl cocaine   oh  god  i'm gonna get in such trouble   chloe latimer says you supplied her with a wrap of cocaine   what  you're kidding   why would she say that if it's not true   there was this couple  down from london for a long weekend   in a suite  spending money   they asked me if i could get them some coke   chloe was working for me that weekend   i asked her if she knew where i might find some   she took so bloody long  the couple had gone   i gave it back to her   not now   thanks  emily  sorry   where did chloe get it from   she said a friend   she didn't tell me his name   she said he didn't deal  but he knew where to get stuff   did her brother have anything to do with it   it's    it's nothing to do with that   do i get arrested  we will have to process the of fence   can we keep this quiet  i could lose my license   fix a time to come down the station  make a formal statement   cocaine though  it must be a one off   they're not that type of family  chloe's not that type of girl   nobody ever is  no  i live here   we don't have these problems   a couple of arrests for possession every month on the estate  but no more than that   are you just making one for yourself   ellie  you might want to take this one   what are you doing

inappropriate  tone it down   you want a to do list  laurie  send some flowers to the family   put a picture of danny in your shop  collect for a cause danny liked   get a hold of yourself and grieve respectfully   and then  when the killer is caught   which i'm sure will be soon    the beach will re open in full   and we make sure people still come here and buy things   until then  be a decent person  would you   she's so right  it's embarrassing   what's that   thai was closed  chippie was the only place open   i can't eat that   you don't eat fish and chips  what kind of a scot are you   it's all there is  eat  or be hungry   postman's alibi's confirmed  four times   he was with his mates all night  the night danny was killed   so jack marshall got it wrong then   do we have any reason to disbelieve the postman   how's marshall's eyesight  does he have any reason to lie   and do we think that the money and the drugs  found at the house are connected  is that cash for the supply of cocaine   you know you do this incessant list question thing   bam bam bam bam  so no one's got a chance to reply   it's like you really enjoy it  do i   yeah  can i eat my dinner  please

can't be objective  you're not the right fit   no  i am the right fit   it's you who's not   taking promotions meant for other people   not accepting a coffee or a bag of chips without a great big sigh   sorry    sir   you need to understand  miller  anybody's capable of this murder  given the right circumstances   most people have a moral compass  compasses break   and murder gnaws at the soul   whoever did it will reveal themselves  sooner or later   no killer behaves normally over time  you know the people here   look for the out of the ordinary  follow your instincts   my instinct tells me the latimers did not kill their son   quiet   hello again   what do you want   di alec hardy  wessex police   what's it about  anthony ryan   who owns the hut up on briar cliff  said you had the

allow this to happen   have we been    abandoned   i'm sure we're all asking that question  after the events of the last week   hello   i'm sure it's just a shower  we'll go to the playground later

to know that nothing offends me more     than cranks wasting police time   i receive messages   i don't    i don't ask for them  i don't question them   did the message happen before or after  you were sent to install extra phone lines here   after  amazing  i love this    the phone engineer who hears voices from the dead   i don't want this   it comes to me  look  you don't want to listen  that's fine   oh  you're a reluctant psychic   a child has died  and you come in with this self indulgent horseshit   did you ever meet danny latimer   no  never  d'you know the family   no  i don't think so   do you have any evidence relating to the death of danny latimer   no   interview terminated at 6 17pm   you know what happens around a murder  mr connelly   a whole industry grows up   of groupies  and rubberneckers   and people who want to touch the case  you're just the first   don't let me see you round here again  get him out   she says she forgives you   about the pendant   every big case  these people come crawling out the woodwork   what did he mean about the pendant  do you know   he has the bloody nerve to come in our office   check his details   find out who he is  rule him out  just to be sure   what are you going to do now   mark latimer lied to us about where he was that night   danny's social network profiles from his hard drive   they've just come though  all his posts    3rd may  going to get a lock on my door  keep all this crap out   she's totally having sex with dean   i'm the one you used to play with    see you later   ellie   'well  first and foremost  all of our prayers are with the latimer family   it's obviously a very worrying time   but we all believe the investigation will uncover what happened   we're a very strong community  and i hope the people who live here know  that the church is here for them to offer whatever support they need   throughout the coming days   faith or no faith   i know the latimer family quite well  and we will do everything we can to support them at this time '  'reverend paul coates   '  hey  i was watching that   where are you going   mark   mark  mark   well don't just stand there  get after him   enjoy your moment of glory  did you  what  no   we don't need you  we don't need your support   your god left my son for dead   too slow  mate   you ok  you all right   erm  thursday night   the night danny went missing  where were you   on a call out   call came through    i dunno  early evening  about half six   whole family's system had packed in  you know   how long did that take  most of the night   it was a nightmare boiler  so i was there pretty late   no  there was no call out   we have cctv footage of the car park at the top of briar cliff   you were there at 7 30   er    so you're snooping on me now   well  checking cctv in the area   now  what did you do that night  what am i  a suspect   the first thing we do is eliminate people from the investigation   you tell me where you were  who you were with  how long for   i can eliminate you from suspicion  it's entirely methodical   you don't give me those facts  i can't eliminate you   and if i can't eliminate you  you're a person of interest   in the murder of my own son   i'm sure this is all very straightforward   i er    i met a mate   you know  we drove off together  and then he dropped me back at the car park and er    i came home   what time  three or four in the morning  maybe   what's your mate's name   i can't remember  sorry   you can't remember the name of your friend   where did you go   i think we just had a drive around  bite to eat  bit of a drink   you think  this was three days ago   yeah  and a lot's happened since then   and is there any reason  you wouldn't want to tell me the name of your mate   this is only about who killed danny  nothing else   um     it'll come back to me  i'm just knackered   i haven't been sleeping  you know  all the stuff on the news   head's not straight   when you came in  you went straight to bed  yeah   can your wife confirm what time you came back   no  she was asleep   come and see this   that's blood  and it's a match for danny's fingerprint   danny was killed here  we think so  yeah   killed here  and then moved two miles down the coast to where we found him   why would anyone do that   the boys have been all over this place  it's been ruthlessly cleaned  except for that  and something else in here   mark  who you met   it's a big gap in your recollection   sorry   what  i'm at the hut   soco think it's where danny was killed   we found his prints and some blood  right  anything else   yeah  the whole place has been cleaned   but we've also found another set of prints by the sink   i messaged them through to run a match against elimination prints   'they belong to mark latimer '
