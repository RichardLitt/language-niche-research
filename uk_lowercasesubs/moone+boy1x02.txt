it was election time in ireland and a charismatic young senator was  running for president   bright  passionate  articulate  and most amazingly of all     a lady   not an iron lady  a human woman lady   no  that's not her  you fool  that's her opponent  brian lenihan   there she is  there's mary robinson  vote mary  mary for president   not a tart with a heart  but a heart who makes tarts   the mary robinson campaign had such low hopes of victory in the lenihan  stronghold of boyle that they put very little funding into the region   but call it feminism  call it nationalism  call it boredom   but debra and the girls decided to take up the cause   a woman for president is it   yeah   oh  that'd be a lot for her to take on  all that stress   i wouldn't like to do that to her     she does want to be the president   does she though   i mean  i'm signing up for stuff all the time without thinking it through   maybe i could vote for her to be the president's wife   that's grand   just put a big x beside mary's name   and then she'll be the president's wife  alright   alright  unless there's any strong male candidates of course    in a bitter sweet business coup   liam moone had won the lenihan poster contract for the whole county     which really amused debra moone     hi mum  as she headed off to her mary robinson campaign meeting   you sure you don't need a hand   i'm ok actually pal   what's she doing here   i'm de clawing swans  what does it look like i'm doing  dumb nut   but what about butch and sundance   it's been ages since we last did a job together   martin  i thought you said you'd fill the spray gun up for me   oh  balls   i'm from sweden   yeah    i suppose it has   where's mam   campaign meeting   again  wait  you're not cooking dinner tonight are you   if you want to do the cooking that's fine with me    ok  let's not go crazy here  everyone just calm down   what delights have we got in store   just some rice and veg and potatoes   and sausages   all in the same pot      saves on washing up   oh that's a shame  trish  you know i can't eat cauliflower   that's broccoli   okey doke  i think i'm gonna go and have a little cry   cool  i'll give you a shout when it's ready   just waiting for the plastic to dissolve   every day there is more enthusiasm   people have thought about the presidency   they want something different  they want change     look at her there  with her strong hands and her bouncy hair   she's like the joan of arc of connacht   sorry   where were we   strategy meeting   right  thank you  debra   i was thinking  if it wasn't too much trouble  doorstep canvassing   how do we feel about that   i'd welcome the opportunity   oh not right now   ya know  it's all very well doing the door to doors  but we really need to get more mary posters up   the one we have is great but it's just not enough   there's only one mary poster   it seems like more   that's just cos i keep moving it around every night     and i needn't tell you  ladies  how quickly velcro  loses its velcrosity after a shower   don't talk to me about that   still  we have our mobile campaign unit   yeah  it's just not very presidential though  is it   no  no it's not   is there no chance that liam might give us a few freebies   we can't expect charity  ladies  we simply have to raise some funds   what a lovely man liam is   oh yes  he's a lovely man   ah  he's gas   as i was saying about the funding    let's not have an argument   what  who's arguing   sorry  it just felt a bit like an argument there for a second     no  no one's arguing    i think you're arguing debra   she is  yeah   it was a bit    snidey   no   i am just suggesting we approach the more affluent citizens of boyle  and ask for political donations   excellent  after the meeting  gwen   you're such a clever person  we should do that   war averted   does anyone in boyle have money   there's pat burke   no  no  he's dead  sure   oh that's right  james brogan   dead   the other one  oh yeah  from bridge street  i thought you meant     oh  he's long gone   yeah  the big c got him   hit by a car   the younger one   yeah  he's dead too   francie feeley has money   touchy feeley   he's such a letch   yeah  my roger wouldn't like me going near touchy feeley's house   right  we're in agreement to forget that idea   francie 'touchy' feeley owned the local fish factory   he was a rich  uncomplicated tool whose nickname was earned due  to his over exuberant affection   touchy's physical bonhomie may have been welcomed  had he not always borne the fresh scent of gutted mackerel   there's more than one way to skin a cat and you don't want to be the cat   bye bye now  father   presidential election looms now and brian lenihan seems  surging ahead today in the opinion polls  while labour's mary robinson  says she is still in the race   they'll say quite openly   this time i'm voting for the best person   to be president and i'm going to vote for you    i'll mop the floor with you robinson   this is quite progressive of you  brian   when you lose the election you'll make a good house husband   we are not eating that shit   oh great  i'm in time  thought ye'd have finished eating   i have   did you get a hair cut   just a trim  what do you think   oh my god  you got the 'mary'  i did   what is it  is it a person   i love it  mam  the 'mary' is sooo 'in' at the moment   stop it  it's modern and sophisticated    and articulate   an articulate haircut   you wouldn't understand  it's about feminism   so    is it shorter than it was   sorry  wrong house   great   yeah  i think i'll try another house too   this election is more important for them as women  than any membership of any political party   i was thinking  to help ease your conscience   maybe i'd let you do a few mary posters for free   just so you can sleep better at night   that's your fake snore  your real snore is far more unpleasant   i said i'd give ye a discount  now push over   i suppose there's just no room for a modern woman these days   all right  joni mitchell  park yer horse  i like mary  i do   but i have to get paid though   how do you feel about half

i don't believe we've met   look at this place     he calls it  the pollack palace    although the guards call it  elm street    cos so many women come running out screaming   we have do it  for mary

tuesday   want some jus   you bet i feckin jus   thanks  eclair   as martin filled his neglected belly  the robinson crusaders tried  to fill their campaign chests   and we think she'd be great for women's rights   and breaking down boundaries   there's nothing i like more than breaking down women's boundaries   for too long women have had their hands tied   struggling to breathe beneath mirrored ceilings   em    glass ceilings   indeed  it's like mary said you know    if the rights of women are constrained    no man can be truly free    he may have the power  but he will not have freedom    wow  you're actually quoting her   you seem surprised   did i not tell you i was a big mary man   you do seem like a big mary man all right   well i am  i'm huge     do you have one of those full size mary posters   with the legs and everything   eh  no  i'm afraid we don't   why not  if i had a body like hers  i'd be displaying it everywhere   thing is  we're actually kinda having some funding issues   not any more you're not   what do you mean   i'll give ye money  was that not obvious   cos i was pointing at myself and everything  with me thumb   oh right  yeah  of course   sorry  well  anything you can do to help the cause would be     a thousand pounds   wow  that would be amazing   that's no problem  it's like the old saying  you scratch my back etc    great   sorry

anecdote killed me  as always   well  that is a great story   i can't wait to come back tomorrow night   oh  do you really think i should go back so soon   of course you should   martin  they'd be so disappointed if you weren't here tomorrow night   they wouldn't even eat   you are so right  i'm too hard on myself   i'm always saying it   but would martin's best friend be so welcoming of his new pastry pal   you're a riot  i didn't say anything   well this is a bit sudden   you're all over that new kid like a tramp on chips   chips  are people still eating chips  here  try this   that is a chocolate mouse ingested with homemade creme egg   his mam makes them  p  with her wand hands   ohhhh  i get it  so you're just using him   ah that's grand then   no  it's not like that  trevvy's cool

i've been thinking about what i'd like you to do to return the favour   oh    right   i'd like you to come over and do a spot of cleaning for me   excuse me   remember we were talking about scratching each other   when i said i'd give you the thousand pounds   well  i'm sure we can get someone to go over and     no  it has to be yourself and linda   these foreign cleaners are dropping like flies   i need strong irish backs for the things i need doing   well  i'll have to talk to linda of course   brilliant  i'll see you later on  and debra   wear something nice   oh  hi martin   i wasn't sure what we were eating  so i just brought a bottle of both   cover all bases   i'm gonna open this one  ya might wanna throw that in the fridge   and there's no chance he just wants ye to clean his house   they call him  touchy feeley  not  keeps his hands to himself feeley   look  i'm happy to embarrass myself for the cause  sure look it   if i have to parade around in whatever     do a little polishing for the sake of feminism  then so be it   it's all for the greater good  yeah  and i've got some stuff we can wear   what's your bra size   no   i'm not finished   we're here to better our plight  not muddy it  this is our time   i've rented myself to enough bad men  it's time to own myself   votes or no votes  if we succumb to this endless bs  we lose   and i am here to win  for every irish woman who is sick and tired of  the fish stenched mouth of sexism   and so  our brave ladies of the night planned a subliminal  campaign for the ages   no  they didn't have money for posters and no   they couldn't be bothered going door to door so they did what women do   they used trickery to get what they wanted   hellooo    is this the shannonside fm request line   ok that was smokey robinson   and now again by popular request here's  mary  by the 4 of us   vote for mary   amen   vote for mary   what  vote for mary   nice   meanwhile which our latchkey kid     hey  babs  what's

posters     maybe we should just be happy with her as the president's wife   no   well what else can we do   good question  noreen  what else could you do   with the electorate stuck in the past and liam holding firm on half price   debra was forced to turn to the fresh  fishy friend of feminism   hello  francie  it's me  'i thought i told you to leave me alone '  eh no  no  sorry   it's debra moone   well  debra  it's about time   this back scratching offer was about to expire     so we're still on for the thousand pounds then   so long as you're still on for getting down and dirty     by

grand  slip your shoes off   and your socks   i feel so ashamed  is this really necessary   deb  if we're going to demean ourselves for mary   then we're going to do it properly   the way she'd want it done   absolutely  exploitation for the nation  what the      marys  non velcro marys   thanks to liam and mary men around the country the new  presidential voice of ireland would be a feminine one
