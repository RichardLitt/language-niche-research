arabic saying    i lay my life for your sake    it's a debt of honour   he owes you his life   thank you    this was how the end of an era was heralded     the american marines leaving  after three weeks of war  scenes of jubilation have replaced fighting and bombing     they used to chant for saddam   now they are pledging their loyalty to george w bush     politicians are beginning to ask whether the danger was exaggerated   the intelligence flawed     despite repeated assurances by the prime minister   that wmds will be found in iraq   firm evidence of saddam hussein's supposed arsenal   of chemical and biological weapons has yet to be found    daddy  lexie  sweetheart   missed you so much   careful  i've got metal pins in that shoulder   we've been into rhq every day  they didn't know where you were   then they did  but not how badly hurt   home now  though  aren't i    it may also be an indication that the feared threat   of chemical or biological retaliation   may not be as serious as we'd been led to believe     katie dartmouth in southern iraq    let's get some of this inside you   i'm sorry  you are   i'm his best mate   so  how's he doing  doc   he has bullet fragments lodged in his brain   if we try to remove them we may do more harm than good   come in   sergeant  i've discussed the pertinent points of the operation  with the co   do you have anything to say in defence of your actions   no  sir  no defence  that's to your credit   hat off  sergeant   i'm sorry  mate   the blokes won't work with you   i wouldn't work with me   the boss wants to do this on medical grounds   have you returned to unit   sir  i'd rather resign   'the army can still use you '  as a bean counter   'you beat the clock  john '  'be grateful for that '  how is she  how do you think   she's worried she's going to have to leave all her friends   didn't you tell her i was staying local   she's ten years old   you know this flat's only for a little while  don't you   budge

get straight to the point '  'i'm no longer serving in the army  as a result of injuries sustained in combat '  and for the past six years i've served in various    john  please  you don't need to sell yourself to me   i am hearing about a number of lucrative opportunities in iraq   private security contractors   i was thinking of something closer to home   look  john  i mean no disrespect

said that she'll have me and lexie for a bit   but we've got the flat   just till you get yourself straight   yeah   it's easier that way  isn't it   i will make this better   for all of us   i know you will    major combat operations in iraq have ended     in the battle of iraq   the united states and our allies have prevailed    seven years after the invasion   seven years of bloody occupation   and the battle for iraq is yet to be won   life in the streets appears at least to continue peacefully   but an undercurrent of violence hides just beneath the surface   with the us pull out scheduled for the end of the year   many iraqis i've spoken to are worried   they believe that hard line sectarian groups  are preparing to take advantage of the void created by withdrawal   just last month in this market  a bomb attack     erm    a bomb attack    cut   sorry  what's up   you ok  do it again   ok  bye   this doesn't feel right   what do you mean  i've seen this guy   it's the boy

incidental or directly related to her father   any contact  not yet   all we know is that katie was abducted 17 kilometres from basra  near a town called al harith  it's a sunni district   predominantly   her film crew were killed on sight  there were no witnesses    katie dartmouth has been reported missing      any means of tracking her   no  her mobile was destroyed so we can't use that   but she did have the presence of mind to take a photo with her phone  and sms it to her office   given the time the picture was taken   we're pretty certain it's one of her abductors   her producer wants to know if he can release it to the press   sir   sir   yes  erm    no  hold off   at least until we've sent it to iraqi intelligence and police  ok   see if they can identify him before we open it to the public    we go live to patrick dartmouth  katie's father   and former foreign minister     this is very sudden and shocking news  katie always knew       confirm  final line crossed at 19 17    we are on the start line  good to go at your command    they are in position  sir  it's your call   i've done a terrible thing to you   but consider the blood of ours that has been
