it  when his store closed down and the staff made redundant     he conned the company out of  60 000 and shared it amongst his coworkers   he fled to england in the '70s     but by then he'd got the taste and hasn't looked back since   once stroller's got his mark     it's time to move up to the next level   the insideman   michael stone  also known as  mickey bricks    he's in a class all on his own  a long con player  never been convicted   it is a matter of personal pride     to every fraud investigator in the country  to be the one who nails him   just finished his first spell in prison

spends his cash faster than he'd like   he's generally a sucker for a pretty face   spends money to impress  the shorter the skirt  the looser he gets   sounds like you really warmed to this guy  albert   yes  he's an objectionable little man  with the morals of an alley cat   that's marks for you   this crew isn't about conning little old ladies out of their pension   they're strictly major league   and remember  mickey bricks thinks he's cleverer than us   that there's no way we can catch him   let's prove him wrong   time to get an edge     did i miss something    one phone call in two

for your kindness   it's a strange state of affairs if one chap can't do a favor for another     without money rearing its ugly head   one day you may be in a position to do something similar for us   you know  i just might  i have a suggestion   a business associate has asked me to make an investment for him tomorrow   if you'll allow me  i'll put in  say   500 for you   i'll take the  500 back  you just get to keep the profit   it'll have cost me nothing     but at least i'll feel happier knowing i've done something   that sounds very generous   good   thank you   this investment  can i ask what it is   just stocks and shares  nothing too exciting   fingers crossed   i'm sure that won't be necessary     what do you think    looks like a no iose situation to me   my favorite kind   they

expecting you     right this way    thank you   got it  they've got a positive id   he's a short con artist called danny blue   any history   he played a con three months ago  south of the river   but the mark withdrew his complaint     and cps wouldn't prosecute without evidence   why did he pull out   the mark bet his life savings in a horseracing scam     but his wife didn't know anything about it   i suppose he wanted to keep it that way   hard to explain over breakfast  i guess   it must be true what they say   there's one born every minute    gentlemen  come in  take a seat   thank you   sorry i'm late  guys   ran into an old friend   gentlemen  welcome to the land of plenty   thank you   what i'm about to show you may be foolproof     but it's also illegal   there's no victim  but it's against the law   would you like me to continue   you see  the first rule of the con        is you can't cheat an honest man    it's never been done     can't happen    impossible   it only works if you want something for nothing     what do we do    we give you nothing for something   you're  1 000 up so far   it's a very good time to walk away     but he can't    because he's so greedy     so what do we do    feed the greed   but he's got one last chance   we've told him it's illegal   you could lose everything     career  wife  home    prison   get out while you can   do the smart thing   as i was saying  what i'm about to show you     may be foolproof  but it's against the law   now  would you like me to continue   laws were made to be broken   can you tell peterson i want those breakdowns by lunchtime   thank you   share transactions from tokyo and new york     are relayed to the city of london by computer   or more precisely  our computer   when the multi nationals publish their annual reports  there's a flurry of activity   if a company does well  their shares attract buyers and the price jumps   we've managed to delay those transactions in the system long enough     to assess them and put our own order in to buy before them   so you buy  knowing the share prices are gonna go up     exactly    they must notice the delay   not when it's less than nine tenths of a second   you can do this in less than a second   our mainframe can make three million calculations in that time   what's in it for you   i take 25  of your profit     25     non negotiable   hang on  the profit is guaranteed  right   set in stone  if there's no profit  i don't get paid   in three days  the oil company vestron are releasing their annual report   once it's out  every major broker will be crawling all over those shares   the plan is to buy  500 000 worth of shares   i have two investors already in place at  100 000 each   there are three places left    100  000   great  yeah  i'm in   i don't know if i can raise that kind of money     the boat leaves in three days  either you're on it  or you're not  tony   it's a lot of money  but i'll find it   you don't mind if i call my broker   what i've just said can't leave this room   i'm not in the habit of investing in companies i've never heard of   george  peter williams  what do you know about vestron   no problem  just heard a whisper  that's all   no  i'll call you if anything comes of it   count me in   good  one more thing     i don't want to leave any paper trails  the money has to be in cash     cash    problem     i suppose not    good   i just want to thank you for this opportunity     likewise    thank you   work the spell   how're you doing   save us both a little time  i don't screw people i work with   no   does that go for everyone   or just the troops   do you want a little tip  danny  some friendly advice   yeah  that would be great   watch and learn  stay out of things that don't concern you     your guys seem pretty tight    after a while  you get to be family   i say something funny   no  the whole family thing works for me   you play short cons  danny   emptying people's wage packets on a friday night  you wouldn't understand     can i make a criticism    okay    100 000   we can take this guy for a lot more than that   that's the bit you don't get   it's not just about the money     since when    since always   you don't get that  you don't get anything   my old man was as straight as they come   never wanted much and life didn't disappoint him   he worked  ate  slept   paid his taxes on time  toed the line   the only dream he had was retiring at 60   dropped dead in the post office three days before his 60th birthday   he was paying his phone bill     i'm sorry    yeah  me  too   you want to be regular people  do you   go do that  they're crying out for foot soldiers down there   go and have your life run by bosses  bank managers  and politicians   but if you want to be a grifter     don't have anything in your life you can't walk away from in a second   lovers  friends  even your own mother   what about your wife   i heard what happened   she wanted me to be something i wasn't   and i was desperate not to disappoint her   recipe for disaster   if you were still together     you're telling me you could just walk away from her   first rule  danny   always look after number one   if you don't  no one else will   i'll try and remember that   go home  danny  get some sleep   danny blue   the kid did well today   reminds me of

press charges   you ever been to prison  danny     shouldn't you be taping this    that's plan b     want to hear plan a    surprise me   we've already got enough to send everyone down  no way around that   but bearing in mind who the mark is  the powers that be     would rather not have a lengthy trial   they think the details might be embarrassing   what they need is a watertight case so overwhelming  everyone pleads guilty   we'll rush the sentencing through and the whole thing blows over   sounds like you've got it all worked out   we have   we know you came into the game late  so you get a lifeline     which is    just do what you've been doing   after the arrests  we take you to a safe house  you make a statement   once the team knows we've got your evidence     they'll know they can't do anything but plead guilty   in return  you walk away into the sunset   what if i don't   like i said  you go down with the rest of them     and we'll add the rawlings job for good measure   all you have to do is go back  pretend we never had this conversation   mickey and the others are going to prison whatever you do   the only choice you have to make is whether you go with them or not   be smart  danny   look after number one     where's the kid    he'll be here   opening night nerves   williams is on his way up   gentlemen   you're late     i'm sorry      doesn't
