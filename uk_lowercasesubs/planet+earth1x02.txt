visit   human beings venture into the highest  parts of our planet at their peril   some might think that  by climbing a great mountain  they have somehow conquered it   but we can only be visitors here   this is a frozen alien world   this is the other extreme    one of the lowest hottest places  on earth   it's over a hundred metres  below the level of the sea   but here a mountain is in gestation   pools of sulphuric acid are indications  that deep underground  there are titanic stirrings   this is the danakil depression  in ethiopia   lying within a colossal rent  of the earth's surface  where giant land masses  are pulling away from one another   lava rises to the surface  through this crack in the crust  creating a chain of young volcanoes   this one  erta ale   is today the longest continually  erupting volcano on the planet   a lake of lava that has been  molten for over a hundred years   these same volcanic forces  also created ethiopia's highlands    this land was just as flat and as deep  as the danakil depression   molten lava rising  from the earth's core  forced up a huge dome  of rock 500 miles wide   the roof of africa   over millennia   rain and ice carved the rock  into a landscape  of spires and canyons   these summits  nearly 3 miles up   are home to some very  remarkable mountaineers    gelada baboons   they are unique  to the highlands of ethiopia   the cliffs where they sleep  are for expert climbers only   and gelado certainly have  the right equipment   the strongest fingers  of any primate  and an utterly fearless disposition   but you need more than a head  for heights to survive up here   a day in a gelado's life reveals  how they've risen to the challenge   for all monkeys morning is grooming time   a chance to catch up with friends   but  unlike other monkeys   gelados chatter constantly  while they do it   it's a great way to network  while your hands are busy   but these socials can't go on  for too long   gelados have a busy daily schedule  and there's work to be done   most monkeys couldn't live up here   there's no food  and few insects to feed on   but gelados are unique    they're the only monkeys in the world  that live almost entirely on grass   they live in the largest assemblies  formed by any monkeys   some groups are 800 strong  and they crop the high meadows  like herds of wildebeest   the gelados graze  alongside walia ibex   which are also unique  to these highlands   these rare creatures  are usually very shy  but they drop their guard  when the gelados are around   you might expect that grazers  would avoid each other's patch  but this is a special alliance  from which both partners benefit   it's not so risky  to put your head down  if others are on the lookout   ethiopian wolves    they won't attempt an attack  in broad daylight   but at dusk the plateau becomes  a more dangerous place   with the grazing largely over  there's a last chance to socialise  before returning to the sleeping cliffs   an early warning system  puts everyone on the alert   their day ends as it began   safe on the steep cliffs   the ethiopian volcanoes are dormant   but elsewhere others still rage   volcanoes form the backbone  of the longest mountain chain on our planet    the andes of south america   this vast range stretches 5 000 miles  from the equator down to the antarctic   it formed as the floor of the pacific ocean  slid beneath the south american  continent  buckling its edge   at the southern end  stand the mountains of patagonia   it's high summer   but the andes have the most  unstable mountain weather on the planet  and storms can erupt without warning   temperatures plummet  and guanacos and their newborn young  must suddenly endure a blizzard   truly  all seasons in one day     a puma    the lion of the andes   pumas are usually solitary and secretive   to see a group walking boldly  in the open is extremely rare   it's a family    a mother with four cubs   she has just one brief summer  in which to teach them  their mountain survival techniques   rearing four cubs to this age  is an exceptional feat   but she does have  an excellent territory   rich in food and water   although the cubs are now  as large as their mother   they still rely  on her for their food   it will be another year  before the cubs can hunt for themselves   without their mother's  skill and experience  they would never survive  their first winter   battered by hurricane force winds   these slopes are now lifeless   further north   they hold other dangers   moving at 250 miles an hour   an avalanche destroys  everything in its path   in the american rockies  a 100 000 avalanches devastate  the slopes every winter   this huge mountain chain  continues the great spine  that runs from patagonia to alaska   the slopes of the rockies   bleak though they are   provide a winter refuge  for some animals   a mother grizzly emerges  from her den  after six months'  dozing underground   her two cubs follow her  and take their first steps  in the outside world   these steep slopes provide  a sanctuary for the cubs   a male bear would kill  and eat them given the chance   but big animals find it difficult  to get about here   males may be twice  the size of a female  and even she  can have problems   her cubs  however   make light of the snow  and of life in general   but the mother faces a dilemma   it's six months  since she last fed  and her milk is starting  to run dry   she must soon leave the safety  of these nursery slopes  and lead her cubs away  from the mountain   if she delays   the whole family will risk starvation   summer reveals the true nature  of the rockies   stripped of snow   the peaks bear their sculpted forms   only now can mountaineers  reclaim the upper reaches   two miles up the crumbling precipices  seem devoid of life   but there are animals here    a grizzly bear   it seems to be an odd creature  to find on these high rocky slopes   it's hard to imagine  what could have attracted it here   at this time of the year  bears should be fattening up for the winter   yet they gather in some numbers  on these apparently barren slopes   they're searching  for a rather unusual food    moths   millions have flown up here  to escape the heat of the lowlands  and they're now roosting  among the rocks   moths may seem  a meager meal for a bear   but their bodies are rich in fat  and can make all the difference  in a bear's annual struggle for survival   another battle is being waged here  but on a much longer timescale   these loose boulders are  the mountain's crumbling bones   the rockies are no longer rising  but slowly disintegrating   all mountains everywhere are being  worn down by frost  snow and ice   the alps were raised  some 15 million years ago  as africa  drifting northwards   collided with the southern edge of europe   these spires are the eroded  remains of an ancient seabed  that once stretched  between the two continents   but these are just  the alpine foothills   the range at its centre  rises to 3 miles high  and is crowned  with permanent snows   the matterhorn   its summit too steep  to hold a snow field   mont blanc   the highest peak  in western europe   the distinctive jagged shapes  of the alps  were carved  by those great mountain sculptors    the glaciers   immense rivers of moving ice   laden with rock   grind their way  down the mountains   gouging out deep valleys   they're the most powerful erosive force  on our planet   a moulin   a shaft in the ice  opened by melt water  as it plunges  into the depths of the glacier   like the water running through it   the ice itself is constantly moving   flowing down the valley  with unstoppable force   alpine glaciers may seem immense   but they're dwarfed by those in the great ranges  that divide the indian  subcontinent from tibet   this is the boulder strewn snout  of the giant baltoro glacier  in the karakoram mountains of pakistan   it's the biggest mountain glacier  on earth     this huge ice filled valley  is so large  it's clearly visible from space   this is the greatest concentration  of peaks over 5 miles high  to be found anywhere on earth   they're the most  dangerous mountains of all   k2 and her sister peaks  have claimed more lives than any others   the peaks here rise so precipitously   the glaciers are so steep and crevassed  that few except the most skilled  mountaineers can penetrate these ranges   markhor gather  for their annual rut   males must fight  for the right to breed   but on these sheer cliffs  any slip by either animal could be fatal   a snow leopard    the rarest of himalayan animals   it's a female returning to her lair   these are the first intimate images  of snow leopard ever filmed in the wild   she greets her one year old cub   her den is well chosen   it has exceptional views  of the surrounding cliffs   on these treacherous slopes  no hunter other  than the snow leopard  would have a chance  of catching such fragile prey   a female with young  makes an easier target   her large paws give  an excellent grip  and that long tail  helps her balance   silently she positions herself  above her prey   she returns with nothing   golden eagles patrol these cliffs  in search of the weak or injured   with a 2 metre wing span  this bird could easily  take a young markhor   eagles hunt by sight  and the thickening veil  of snow forces them to give up   for the leopard  the snow provides cover  and creates an opportunity   the worsening weather dampens  the sound of her approach  allowing her to get  within striking distance   it was an act of desperation  to try and catch such a large animal   wolves have made a kill  giving other hunters  a chance to scavenge   the worst of the blizzard brings  success for the snow leopard   but having descended so far  to make the kill  she has a grueling climb  to get back to her lair   the cub must be patient   it'll be a year  before it has the strength and skill  to kill for itself  on these difficult slopes   the snow leopard is  an almost mythical creature   an icon of the wilderness   an animal few humans  have ever glimpsed  for its world is  one we seldom visit   the karakoram lie  at the western end of a range  that stretches  across a tenth of our planet    the himalayas   these  the highest mountains  of the world   like other great ranges   were created by the collision  of continents   some 50 million years ago  india collided with tibet  thrusting up these immense peaks   which are still rising   this vast barrier  of rock and ice  is so colossal  it shapes the world's climate   warm winds from india   full of moisture   are forced upwards  by the himalayas   as the air rises so it cools   causing clouds to form  and the monsoon is born   at high altitudes  the monsoon rains fall as snow   here  at the far eastern end  of the range in china   one inhabitant endures  the bitter winters out in the open   most other bears would be  sleeping underground by now   but the giant panda can't  fatten up enough to hibernate   its food  bamboo  on which it totally relies  has so little nutritional value  that it can't build up  a store of fat like other bears   most of the creatures here move up or down  the slopes with the seasons  but the panda is held  captive by its diet  for the kind of bamboo it eats  only grows at this altitude   but these forests hold  fewer challenges for the more mobile   the golden snap nosed monkey   like the giant panda  lives only in china   their thick fur allows them to survive  at greater altitudes than any other monkey  and when the cold bites  they have these upper slopes to themselves   even if you have a warm coat  it apparently helps to surround yourself  with as many layers as possible   but at least these monkeys  have a choice    if they tire of tree bark  and other survival food  they can always descend  to lower warmer altitudes  and not return there till spring   as the snows retreat  trees come into bloom   cherry blossom   rhododendrons    here in their natural home  they form great forests  and fill the landscape  with the covers of a new season   these forests are a host  to a rich variety of springtime migrants   beneath the blooms   another display   it's the mating season  for oriental pheasants   himalayan monal   tragopan  and blood pheasant   musk deer make the most  of a short flash of spring foods   this male smells a potential mate   the red panda   rarely glimpsed in the wild   it was once considered  a kind of raccoon   but is now believed  to be a small mountain bear   by midsummer its larger  more famous  relative  has retreated into a cave   a giant panda nurses  a tiny week old baby   her tender cleaning  wards off infection   she won't leave this cave  for three weeks   not while her cub  is so utterly helpless   progress is slow  for milk produced on a diet  of bamboo is wretchedly poor   four weeks old  and the cub is still blind   its eyes do not fully open  until three months after birth   but the chances of the cub  reaching adulthood are slim   the struggle of a giant panda  mother to raise her cub  is a touching symbol of the precariousness  of life in the mountains   on the highest summits  of our planet  nothing can live permanently   the highest peak of all   mount everest  five and a half  miles above sea level  and still rising    the roof of our world   of those humans who've tried to climb it  one in ten have lost their lives   those that succeed can stand  for only a few moments on its summit   the nepalese call it 'a mountain  so high no bird can fly above it '  but each year  over 50 000 demoiselle cranes  set out on one of the most  challenging migrations on earth   to reach their overwintering  grounds in india  they must cross the himalayas   by late morning ferocious winds  are roaring past the peaks   the cranes must gain height  to avoid the building storm   they've hit serious turbulence   they must turn back  or risk death   a new day  and a new opportunity   the flock stay in close contact  by calling one another   weak from lack of food and water   they use thermals  rising columns  of warm air  to gain height   for many this is their first journey  across the himalayas   for some  it will be their last   the golden eagles  have been expecting them   the eagles work in pairs  to separate a young crane from the flock   it escapes the touches of one   and is caught by another   but even a young crane  is a heavy prize  and the eagle has  to struggle to control it   the mother can wait no longer    this is a desperate race  against worsening weather   the rest of the flock  battle on   in the ascent every wing beat  becomes an exhausting struggle   at last they are over the highest  barrier that lies in their way   but like all who visit  the world of the high mountains  they dare not linger   visit written   synchr  by m06166
