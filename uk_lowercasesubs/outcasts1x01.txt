 carpathia  this is ct 9   can you hear me  carpathia   captain kellerman from ct 9 calling carpathia   we're approaching your atmosphere   are there any human beings out there   tyger  tyger  burning bright in the forest of the night   mummy   busy   deaf  remember how i tried to teach you the difference   i saw lights in the sky   there's nothing   is it the transporter with the new people  they're too far away for us to see their lights   d'you think they'll know about the tigers  well     will they  mummy  will they know   of course they'll know   and i bet there still were tigers on earth when they left   in zoos at least   now  i want you up and out of here in one minute  starting now   tyger  tyger  burning bright in the forests of the night   mitchell  we were expecting you tomorrow   well  you know about the new rules  no weapons inside forthaven itself   all my pas officers have handed theirs in  even me   we're not pas officers  stella  we're expeditionaries   ok  but you're still not supposed to be soldiers  your job is to resear     don't tell me my job     to research the planet and its resources   look  the main issue here  mitchell   is that i don't have to justify it to you now   it was passed by general council and everybody will respect that   pas and xps alike   it's the comms room   could be the transporter  we might have made contact at last   check the weapon in  mitchell   carpathia  this is ct 9  can you hear me  carpathia   carpathia  this is ct 9   'carpathia  this is captain kellerman from ct 9 '  we hear you  captain  we hear you   is that a human voice   this is richard tate  president of carpathia  as human as you are   'flash up that we have voice contact with carpathia '  we've got visuals now   'captain  i'm switching from antimatter to normal controls '  'i can see you now '  it's been so long  captain   over five years waiting and hoping for more arrivals   we thought there would be no more arrivals   there might not be now   we've lost all signals from the ships in our departure flotilla   well  i can't tell you what it means to have your signal   what's your status  captain   we've got a couple of higher than normal protocols  on the right side of the ship  fatigue damage   it's important you deal with that   heat stress on atmospheric entry has been an issue for some transporters   how much of an issue   catastrophic  in some cases   ok  it's best to know the truth   i appreciate your honesty   and earth  we lost their pulse signal some years ago   we picked up some data   anybody still down there is       not having such a good time of it   well  let's keep the important questions for when you're in   'i do have one question  actually '  fire away   what's the weather like on carpathia   admirable priorities  captain   um    occasional whiteouts caused by our lunar system  but on the whole     nice and warm   i need to patch things up out here  don't go anywhere   keep beating   keep beating   daddy   how's my boy   i'm practising my poem to welcome the transporter   really   pablo zavaleta is going to sing gracias a la vida   well  that will make five years hurtling through space seem worthwhile   where's your mum   karina   hi   pablo's parents came from a place called chile  is there tigers at chile   not that i remember  armadillos  chinchillas  jaguars maybe     but tigers  i'm not sure   you're early  we weren't expecting you till tomorrow   yeah  i came back to show them what i thought of their weapons ban   i bumped into stella  she said pas officers had already given them up   i don't mind  it's not like i've ever used mine   not long now  we're nearly ready   we're nearly ready  karina   what about linus   linus   linus will be fine  won't you   he'll be better   it's good to see you   right     you're not on duty yet  cass   i heard we had visuals with the transporter  came straight here   is it true  it's true   what   oh  yeah  er     number 4  meet dr stella isen  not just the head of protection and security   but the brainiest woman in the whole universe   couple of guys in food and distribution made four of these   what happened to numbers 1 to 3   not in front of 4   i didn't know general council had approved any livestock clones   no  it was done on the sly   renegade carnivores getting their bacon fix   that and some black market action  i'd imagine   and we intervened just before they      stop it  you'll have me crying in a minute   so   thermal shield damage   shit   captain's apparently very competent  they're doing repairs in orbit   they have a good chance   maybe your family are on board   there have been far too many maybes already  cass   get the pig out of my office   come on  pork chop   i need to go to work   do you love me   you know i do  i've never loved anybody else   and trust me  of course   linus will be fine   and the others left behind   it's only been ten years   we were pioneers before  we'll be pioneers again   i'd miss forthaven   it's a hutch  karina  all tate wants is a bunch of satisfied rabbits   well  i like my work and our friends and     you'll like where we're going better   there's a whole planet out there   i need to take linus to school before my shift   you would never betray me   hmm   anyone else in pas finds out what we're planning     i'll always do what i think is right for linus   this is the right thing  trust me   i've spoken at last to the captain of transporter 9   which is now orbiting carpathia   'they are entering the most dangerous part of their journey   'i will be in constant contact with captain kellerman'  and will keep you informed of all developments   'all public screens will now show the transporter's position  'and significant flight data   'let's all unite in hope'  for the safe arrival of our brothers and sisters  nearing the end of their long voyage from earth   mitchell's back  a day earlier than i expected   mmm   bet he's pleased with the weapons ban   when linus was a baby  i used to take him down to the fence when the expeditionaries came home   hold him up high above the fence so mitchell could see him   nobody goes to welcome them back any more   no  and that hurts him  he needs to be adored   oh  nothing more boring and annoying in my book   you just haven't found mr right yet   the day i say i have  feel free to shoot me   i love a girl in uniform   what did he just give you there   nothing  yeah  he did   i know you  you work in medical distribution   slinging a bit of unofficial sp on the side   you should try some  girls   open your minds  expand your horizons   my horizons are just fine   sorry  gentlemen  we're going to have to take you into pas   we're charging you with two code violations   oh  officers  isn't there some other way to sort this out   i'd literally do anything you ask  you're fresh   it's gonna white out   hey  hey   fleur  leave him   everybody get down   'i've lost him  karina  are you ok '  it's back rolling  fleur  we're ok   agh  ugh   stop  karina   karina  karina   cass  it's fleur  karina's down   karina  karina  can you hear me   karina  please   who was it  we were talking to a couple of sp deadbeats   one of them goes by the name of tipper malone   i'll break his scrawny neck  i didn't say it was him   we were questioning  there was a whiteout  it happened so fast   yeah  i'll break his neck anyway   put a detention order on all the screens for tipper malone   you ok   who could hurt her   she can't die  not karina   everything that can be done is being done for her   as soon as they tell us anything  you'll be the first to know   where's mitchell  we're trying to find him   i've also sent a couple of officers to inform linus's teachers   you think he might have discovered something   we do have another suspect  who   tipper malone  some black market loser   and why would he want to hurt her   i don't know  i want to dbv him  you need to get back to the transporter   what if mitchell did find out   look  let's just take things one step at a time   we asked her to spy on her own husband  stella   yeah  who was plotting to break away and destroy everything we're building here   but she did love him  and it was agony for her   she knew her duty and she was doing it   listen  you need to focus on helping the transporter captain  and let me deal with this   so everybody knew that our only hope  was to find a planet in what is called a goldilocks zone   that means just close enough to a star    not too near and not too far   the right size  as well   wait a moment  children   why did you attack a pas officer   i didn't  i just swapped a few bits and bobs for a few other bits and bobs   you were getting controlled medicines that are supposed to help sick people   real sick people  not just sick in the head people   that's not very nice   anyway  i take great offence at your outdated elitism   do you  now   i'm the voice of liberty  yeah  well  i'm the voice of f     this is     i know who it is   deep brain visualisation  you know about that  too   yep  if you have nothing to hide  it may well prove your innocence   i'd like your consent rather than applying for an order   are you doing it personally   well  the human brain is still my main area of interest   then get ready to be fascinated  doc   captain   'there's growing panic among the passengers   'they know there's something wrong and they're just     'desperate to get in now '  well  you can't attempt atmospheric entry until your ship is ready   'yeah   'it's difficult to explain that to people  'who've been living under these conditions for five years   'we also have a lot of children and newborns '  that's very welcome news for us   um    with your permission  captain   have your comms system patch me through to the entire ship   'clear to speak now  carpathia '  passengers of ct 9   this is president richard tate from forthaven  carpathia   many of you won't know why we named our new planet carpathia   it was to honour the rescue ship  that came to pluck survivors out of the freezing seas  after the titanic disaster on earth   the name reflected the hope we had  that our new home would be a similar refuge   providing safety and warmth after a time of great danger   and we've done our best to achieve that in the ten years we've been here   we came to a planet  where we weren't even sure if we'd survive the first days   and now our solar engineers have given us energy   our scientists have provided us with food       and our expeditionary teams keep making exciting discoveries  about our new home   i know you feel as if you're in the deepest darkness now       but my voice will always be beside you   and the light is such a short distance away   you're not on your own   there are thousands of us down here waiting for you   there is warmth and there is safety on carpathia   what is it   'they're clapping  people are clapping '  well  i guess there's a first time for everything   did you know that the part of the brain that deals with the memory  is called the hippocampus   it means  sea horse    do you remember the sea  tipper   sea horses are unusual creatures  because it's the men that carry the eggs and give birth   every day  the male and females have greeting sessions   now  you had a meeting with someone this morning  didn't you  tipper   how is she   dbv's done  wasn't tipper   stella wants us to find mitchell   he's back  then   early  karina told me that this morning   no  mitchell wouldn't hurt her   apart from his ego  karina and linus were all he cared about   she said he got jealous real quick   mitchell's a bit of a crazy gun head now  but he wasn't always like that   did good things for us at the start   he was the first to go into the mountains   found the first water  brought the stuff back for medicine   at a time when we had no idea what was out there   he's brave  people still remember that   let's find out why he's not at her bedside  then   weapons ban's working well   yeah  um    we're here for the ballet lessons   where's mitchell hoban   we're just here to talk  jack   you wait here  you're the boss   women  eh   when mitchell surfaces  tell him we need to speak urgently   i heard his wife got herself hurt    got herself   her name's karina  i think you know that  right   she's a snake  what   ask your bosses  they had her spying on him  then he must've been doing something wrong   i'll tell you this  you come after mitchell and there's going to be a fight   see how much your weapons ban means then   we're going to find the person who hurt karina  and we're going to take them down   whoever they are  whatever their status   reassure mitchell about that when you see him   well   they came low key  two pas officers  unarmed   i wouldn't rule out the cavalry  though   jones  sir   get me some provisions  yes  sir   i've one last thing to take care of  then i'm heading out to the lake   i want you to follow me out there when you've got everybody ready   mitchell     yeah  what is it   i still think it's too early   it's like i've always said   when the time's right   it has to be now  jack   that's why they've brought in the weapons ban  it's to weaken us   if she betrayed me like that  she must have betrayed me in other ways   i don't think so  mitchell  what do you know   he said what   big fight if we try and detain him   i just can't believe it   just because he's a poster boy  doesn't mean     look  i don't need a lecture on domestic violence  fleur   i can still be shocked and sad  you actually liked mitchell   not liked so much  but i respected him   well  it's not just domestic  jack said she was spying on him for our bosses   what  well  karina said nothing to me about it   never thought things had got that bad with the xps   look  go to karina  and make sure she's protected in case whoever it was     i think we know who it was now   go to the medicentre and double up her protection in case he comes back for a second snap   where are you going  get some answers   how's the mood on board  captain   'better  thank you '  you carrying any vips  by the way  i mean  everybody is  of course  but     'margaret baker  poet and nobel laureate   '  good  you can never have too many poets   '  haas  the climatologist  julius berger   '  berger's on board   'yes  did you know him on earth '  he ran the evacuation programme  i knew him well   'he's   quite an authority to the passengers '  i'm sure   captain  i have somebody down here who has missing family   it's a long shot  but i'd like to put her mind at rest   'i understand  what's her name '  stella isen  her family were due to follow her out   her husband  daniel isen  and daughter  lily   'ok '   parigi o cara  from la traviata by verdi  surprised to see me   you ordered my own wife to spy on me and report to you   what you were planning amounted to a coup  she did her duty   well  you could have stayed here     with your regulations and your lapdogs   except part of your plan was to use forthaven as a supply base  for your new home  well  she really did tell you everything  didn't she   and you certainly made her pay for it  you ignorant thug   what did you say   what did you call me   she loved you   but she was far too good for you   did you fall for my wife like everybody else   no  don't tell me  she let you     you are vulgar as well as stupid   you did  though  didn't you   you couldn't protect your own family  so you thought you'd help yourself to mine   is there anything sadder or more pathetic  than a jealous  strutting conquistador nobody needs   they're out there  tate  they're still outside the fence   still brooding about what we did to them   you ordered their execution  remember that   you remember that  huh   i spared them   i let them go   they need me  they respect me   one word from me and they'll destroy this place   i want you to know that before i kill you   mitchell  what have you done  back off  or i'll kill you   cass   i know about you  remember  who you are  what you are   never breathed a word  not to anybody   i still can't just let you go   but can you stop me   just get back  get down   i don't want to shoot you  cass  just give up  it's not too late   look  just stop  williams  just let him go   just stop  mitchell   too late now  though  isn't it   medics and pas officers to corridor seven   we have a shooter in the building and two men down   we need a do  but nobody is to approach him unarmed   the identity of the shooter is mitchell hoban   williams   when is mummy coming home   soon   why don't we practise your poem again    fearful symmetry    that's the line i always forget   use something to remind you   with the same letters but easier to remember and linked   like   foot and shoe   foot and shoe   for  fearful  and  symmetry    when you get to the line you can't remember  just think foot and shoe    what immortal hand or eye dare frame thy      foot and shoe   don't worry  you'll be fine   do you think the tigers came back  when there weren't so many people hunting them   maybe   if we found a tiger here  would we start hunting them again   that's an excellent question  linus   answer that and you might have the key to our future   i'm ok   go find him   how come he's gone this crazy   what's this about karina spying on him   we don't have time for questions right now   just detain him and protect karina   karina's secure  linus is with his teacher  i'm gonna check he's ok   after i've checked my gun out again   help   please  anyone   help me   stand back   somebody call pas   what happened  i tried to stop him  but he hit me   he's taken the boy   you stay here  i'll send someone round to get you  you understand   you stay here   where's mitchell   he's not in the base  there's no point going in   you need to help us  this goes beyond loyalty   unless you give us mitchell  we'll close down your base and detain you all for harbouring a murderer   the people will back us  you know that  you're not stupid   or you give up mitchell and hang on to what you have   choose  your team or mitchell hoban   i'd advise you to back off   he's a leader to these people  to most people  it's not simple   is it worth us searching any more inside the fence   no   you'd better get him to come back   that kid's fate's in your hands now   they're looking for you   tell everybody to come out and meet me by the lake   i warned you   i just don't think that we're ready for this yet   are you turning against me as well   you're crazy   you remember who i am   you're the man i've looked up to since i've been here   i have to tell you    nothing   you tell me nothing   tell everybody else i'm waiting   what shall we do now  daddy   smells of bureaucracy in here   must make a nice change from dry piss and stale sweat   i need some assurances   for a murderer  i don't think so   not for mitchell   they've got a secret place just where the closed zone begins   it'll be where mitchell was planning to build their settlement   ok  give me the directions  you   yeah  i'm going with you   i don't need    ok  big boy   we go together or not at all   how far is it  about a day's hike   men can be a danger to their children when they think they have nothing to lose   we don't stop until we find linus  it'll be dark before we get there  we need to move   there  what did i tell you   isn't it beautiful   so much water   is this the sea  daddy   no  this is a lake   you want to go in   but i don't know how to swim   well then  i'll teach you   we can do whatever we like now   we're free again   how could he do this to you   the doctors need to do some brain stem tests   cass and fleur have gone out to find mitchell   gone out  what  beyond the fence   what is it   mitchell said something   what   he said they were still out there  who's  they    no  it can't be  we'd know   he's lying  he's trying to unsettle you   well  he's succeeded   what if cass and fleur     he's lying   cass and fleur can look after themselves   you need to get some rest   signal on the srd's gone  cass  we are on our own now   not much daylight left  either   we need to keep going  make up his head start  you heard what stella said   she's a feminist academic  not going to say   it'll turn out for the best   is she   at least she doesn't think violence is the answer to everything   and who does   see  that's the kind of stupid generalisation that really annoys me   it wasn't women who designed  built and fired nuclear weapons   nor did the millions of men who got turned into shadows on the pavements of shanghai and chicago   right  you can't just     agh  agh  cass   you ok  cass  i'm all right  i'm all right   what were you saying   funny   i've lost my kit   help me up   that was close   look  we need to stop before it gets dark   all right  as soon as we find some open space  we'll set up camp   we'll have to share my tent now   don't get any ideas   yeah  right  it's the temptation for you i'm worried about   well  that's going to be a struggle  now you're talking   how's tricks   you got me under surveillance now   don't think much of your disguise  doc   we had to question you   you're in the clear  obviously   i always knew that   can i get a beer   d'you want another one   and another one   you look fed up  something else on your mind   you might say that   actually  do you want to get out of here and go somewhere else   somewhere else    with the head of protection and security   don't mess around  i won't ask you again   well   you've been inside my head  after all   funny to think the transporter's out there somewhere   you remember arriving   i was scared  didn't want the journey to end   i was so excited   you know  me and karina were holding hands  when we first stepped off the ship   i remember her giving my hand a big squeeze cos neither of us could speak   hard to imagine now   i kind of wish i could tell them   tell them what  not to worry   how good it is here   that's one thing i've always liked about you   for all your other thousands of faults  you never whinge   i love forthaven   my life   i wish it could stay like this forever   what   you know  my bolivian friend in f and d  said that there's a secret plan to clone little sheep we can eat as snacks   he might be pulling my leg  you think    what's that   what's what  that noise   let's turn in  as soon as it's light  we move again   hope you don't snore   you got family  captain   a confirmed bachelor  i'm afraid  you   i arrived with my wife  we had two boys   what happened   when we were here first   we lost a lot of children to a    terrible illness called c 23   only children   yes   must have been terrifying   the most terrifying thing was  you could see it before it took hold   see it   a sort of glimmering halo around the heads of its victims   i lost both my boys   and your wife   um     melissa never really     she couldn't come to terms with  er     i understand  i'm very sorry   well  it's why we're so pleased there are children arriving   we have lost so many  i am not the only grieving parent   how did you get rid of it  the virus   we had to make some tough decisions   quarantine       that sort of thing   didn't you promise my passengers a place of safety and warmth   well  we've done great things  i'm proud to be made president   but of course things aren't perfect down here  captain   i didn't come here expecting perfection   what did you expect   a society of human beings with    everything that involves   well  one of our accomplishments is we brew a rather decent beer   and i'll look forward to sharing one with you as soon as you arrive   i'm sorry  i'm getting our final status updates on our shield repairs   i    i'll get back to you as soon as they're in   well  i'm not going anywhere   agh   you ok  yeah  you   yeah  just about  what were they  cass   i don't know  ok  this is bad  this is bad   maybe jack's trying some kind of    they weren't expeditionaries   i don't know  you keep saying that   it's true  i don't bloody know   what if it's  i dunno  alien life  oh  don't be stupid   i'm not sleeping now   nor me   first light  we're out of here   we can't go back now   i hope you can understand that  linus   i loved you both   i loved you both so much   karina  the tests   we should know soon   i saw daniel again   you've been using dbv on yourself   we were at the opera  just before the second taiwan crisis   i was pregnant with lily at the time   we went to see la traviata  and dan was crying at the end like he always did  the big softie   and as violetta is singing that they'll leave paris together       dan's big tears are falling into my hand   i could see everything as it was   i could feel the red velour of the seat   his hand squeezing mine   stella  you must be careful   and then i went to the bar and i picked up some kid   the suspect we cleared  actually   went back to his place   and how was that   surprisingly all right  actually  if a little brief   you know   i know you  richard  you would have asked kellerman   lily's on board   daniel isn't with her   why not  i don't know   i didn't want to tell you because    i know why you didn't tell me   you didn't tell me because    they're still in danger  she might not make it   i can't breathe   carpathia  this is kellerman   go ahead  captain   we've done everything we can now  our updates are positive   we're performing final checks now  and our estimated entry interface is plus one hour   i've got that  captain   look   this is captain kellerman  is richard tate there   i'm here  captain   thank you for all your support   whatever happens now  your presence has been invaluable   we're a few minutes away from entry interface   executing standard de orbit burn and roll  our altitude is 50 miles   there's plenty of plasma flare up here to keep us company   keep your fingers crossed for us  carpathia  we're coming in   they're crossing over the new pacific zone  about to enter upper caledonia   we've got unusual stress readings  carpathia   we've got to move protocols  it's starting to     that protocol's not working  we've got a stress burn in our right     status is abnormal  captain   comms check  i'm on uhf 7  can you hear me   well  they're still in one piece   cass   where's linus   congratulations on finding me   it's beautiful here  isn't it   where's your son  mitchell   he's over there   don't disturb him now   is he ok   mitchell  have you hurt him   we were going to build a new place here   karina betrayed me   go and get linus  don't move   you have to come back with us now   that will be a problem    for everybody   karina probably won't recover  by the way   you start all over again  you mess things up again   that's just how it has to be   right  cass   mitchell  i want to see if linus is ok  protection and security   we think they're important  you seem to have lost touch with both   there are things about tate you don't know   i'm sure there are  things you should know   not for you to tell us   nobody else will   certainly not that bitch stella that you answer to  watch your mouth   go back to forthaven  to your little cocoon   we will  with you   don't  mitchell  don't   karina always said the best thing about fleur was her idealism   shut your mouth  but i could tell you some things   shut your mouth now  you'll have to kill me to stop me killing him   put the gun down  i will kill him  you know i will   do you really believe that
