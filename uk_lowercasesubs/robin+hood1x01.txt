all wrongdoers from my estates awaiting trial or punishment   only the sheriff can pardon   it is custom for the sheriff to accede to his nobles' requests on such matters   well  then i suggest you take it up with the sheriff   was it horrible  the war  what was it like   war is for    for men   you would be upset  little one   yeah   i heard that dying men always ask for their mums     that's

promise   where is everybody   funny  wednesday used to be market day   i think wednesday may still be market day   surely some mistake   my lord  i do not think that this is a laughing matter   sorry  remind me  how many men do you have   twenty four     and he has    one  but the point     but you let him take the house     technically it is still his property    la la la di da   i would have appreciated more support in this matter   relax  relax   i'll get it back to you within a month   twenty four    one   it has been a good month  we have collected nearly 300 pounds   shh   would you want to be the king in antioch   clue  no   trying to feed a starving army on 300 pounds   you promised    500 pounds   it's more than we have managed before   oh  yippee   so the king is starving in the holy land and you have failed him  but      it's more than we ever managed before    robin of locksley   good morning  everyone   sheriff   carry on   locksley  welcome back  i trust sir guy of gisborne  has managed your estates to your satisfaction   i believe he may have managed them to your satisfaction   some of your peasants are unruly  by the way  we have two in custody awaiting punishment     three    three   discipline will be a problem  be warned  loughborough   sheriff  thank you  i report     discipline has never been a problem on my estates     times have changed    not for the better  it seems   you of all people should know that the king needs funds to fight our holy war   is it our holy war  or is it pope gregory's   we stand shoulder to shoulder with rome   we fall shoulder to shoulder too  i have seen it   then what is your proposal to raise money   stop all taxes  today     amusing    i do not joke   today is market day and yet there is no market   and your point is   if a man can make more than he needs for his family   he can take what remains to market  he can trade   and the shire can take its share  but until then we must help every man   every peasant  every pieman  every pinner  provide for his family   get him trading again   a man     who can provide for his family is a comfortable man  a lazy man   doesn't want to work   what we need are hungry men   our noble friend seems to forget that hungry men are virtuous   there is a celebration of my return in the great hall   indeed   and i trust none of us virtuous men will be feasting   my father seems to think he should see you   our house is watched  come after midnight tonight   very well   you're looking    striking   and if you still live with your father  that must mean       take care not to be seen    don't worry  i can look after myself   i don't care about you  i care about my father   are you really as naive as you seem   you think you can pick fights with these people and get away with it   you think you can slight them in public   you're a fool   marian  wait   now is not the time  i know   but i must say  you are     more than ever  your eyes  even when you look at me in anger   i feel you   i believe you can still     even after all this time     you can see into my soul   five years and you're still peddling the same old drivel   does it ever work     you'd be surprised    amazed   bring out the locksley lot   hey  jailer   jailer  that's me   jailer  a ren't you listening   i'm from locksley   jailer  i'm from locksley   give your names   will and luke scarlett     what is your crime    living in the wrong place at the wrong time   living under an evil sheriff  our taxes go to nottingham  to the sheriff  to his birds       name    benedict   son of richard giddens  serf of locksley     what is your crime    stealing flour   are you guilty     what is your punishment    don't know   hanging  no  surely not   what     hanging    robin       no    they told me you'd save us   my dad told me you'd save us   do you mind  we don't tell 'em if it's the dangle   they kick up a hell of a stink   for stealing flour  hanging   the sheriff wants an example  we've just had word     i'll be speaking to the sheriff   meanwhile you treat these prisoners well or you'll have me to answer to   you've got one more     you're not from locksley    i know  but you saved me once before   that was a long way from nottingham  here i am known   look  you're saving those others  you'll save me   for my wife  my newborn babe     you said your wife was expecting    no  she had it   your lies today may be your undoing   i cannot save the others and now i fear you will share their fate   what fate   i'm not from locksley   did i say locksley   there's been a mistake here  i'm from rochdale   rochdale  that's why they call me allan a dale   yeah  and i'm from wild wales   throw him in with the locksley lot   ah  huntingdon  you're missing your own feast     rumors abound    what rumors   that you are weak  that you've returned weakened from your exertions in the holy land   my master returns with honors from the king   the greater honor would have been to have stood and fought with him  surely   i have visited my peasants in your dungeons  they have committed grave crimes     master      which would make much more compassionate    your gesture of pardoning them    pardoning them   i will see them hang   in the morning  you yourself said that we risk rebellion  we must have order   it is custom for the sheriff to hear his nobles' requests for clemency   la di da di da   oh  by the way  in your absence we nominated you to oversee tomorrow's entertainment     no    oh   you don't want these rumors of weakness to spread  hm   better scotch them now   otherwise we'll all pay   marian  might i have the pleasure of your company   well  don't just stand there     if the sheriff's men see      what   you might give them the pleasure of your company   grow up   forgive me  i could not welcome you before   how did this monster become sheriff   i did not watch my back   prince john gives out the shires in his brother' s absence   my bid was not accepted     what can be done    i can do nothing   i am watched  and i must think of my daughter   when i do speak out  no one listens   robin  it is down to you  my friend     what can we do    play nottingham's game   speak to the lords  slowly you can turn them   do not make the mistake i and others have made and make your dissent public   consolidate your position quietly   i do not have time   tomorrow i am to order the hanging of four of my own peasants     it will be the long game  i'm afraid    will and luke scarlett cannot wait   benedict giddens  allan a dale   you must let them die  it is a test  fail it and there will be consequences     perhaps    definitely   this is not a game     my daughter speaks when she should not  but she is right   you have no choice  robin  hide your temper  bide your time   until you can act decisively   or kiss your lands  if not your life  goodbye     murderer    murderer   robin   it's not your fault   lords
