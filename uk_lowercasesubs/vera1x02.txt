fletcher's last collar before i showed up   greatly missed  i'm sure   anyone here work the case   last man standing   well  go on  then  blossom  stand up   let's hear it for kenny   that's it  come on  mind over matter   ok   jeannie  pretty lass   living with a rich boyfriend out in tynemouth     keith      mantel   wife passed away  had an only daughter named     abigail  but everybody called her       abby    abby   she's er       two pretty lasses  under the one roof   fighting over the big man   until keith had enough   he throws jeannie out the house   jeannie is so angry  she follows abby out of town   comes back hours later  scratches down her face   abby's fibres all over her clothes   jeannie strangled her near ebdon wood     clothing  wasn't it    aye  some sort of close weave   tie  scarf  shirt sleeve   we reckon she threw it away   if i could haul us back to this morning     the bus driver confirmed that the father counted   jeannie stepped back into the road     it was suicide    basically   plus five more eye witnesses say the same thing   well  that's dad in the clear     he still hit her    self defence   you love your kids  no matter what   oh  bless him  in his own little world   what was she thinking  running off to her dad's   they would have sent her straight back to ebmore   had enough  i suppose   wanted to go home   i don't know   take care  ok  see

recognised his name    who   well  i just got off the phone to him  he saw her   what  who  saw who   dennis firle saw jeannie long   same time as abby's murder   king's cross station   what   mr  firle knew jeannie from home   he said he would have talked to her  but he and his wife were moving to the states and  they were running late for their flight to phoenix  arizona   but why didn't he say so at the time   no he did  he did   he heard jeannie was in trouble and  he called from the states  it's all in the original action list   look   they squared the case off so fast  that nobody called him back   he's willing to fly over to testify   he read about jeannie online last night   he was totally distraught   jeannie had an alibi all along and     she never knew   so  come on  since

you were   face your demons  in the end  if you can   that's the message   one moment of madness  et cetera   i did what i could for her   within my remit   did she ever talk about the day of abigail's murder   mr  winter   if they knew that i played any part in this   they would have my job   in what   jeannie kept begging me to look into a possible appeal on her behalf   in the end i said    make an account of everything that happened    your story  how you remember it    she sent me all this   craziness  so it seemed   anyway   the last time we met  i told her   no appeal   i gave her hope   weak  cruel of me     here's your dad    sorry i'm late  love     sorry    there's quite a turn out  eh   are you surprised   that dead girl   i can't believe he just went ahead with

  time of death     murder weapon    nah  no sign   well  the night is young     car    belonged to his sister   the boot was   was found like this   what   it's warped   twisted   victim leans in to get something out of the back   down comes the boot  strikes him hard   back of the head     the boot    aye  it's possible   no great blood loss but     possible brain haemorrhage  depending on the force of the blow   that would do it  can we go home now     witnesses    well  it's early days   but no one's come forward   the ticket takers had all gone in   so     the front door was closed   so  very likely  the killer came from the road   it's a fair walk   no one heard any cars  besides  look     the lights in the garden are that low   anyone could have got in and out and not been seen   we could be looking at any one of the guests   it's all right  mam  it's ok   is this the mother   how are we doing   we wanted to call but you don't want to make a fuss   i shall have a word with the medic   get something for your wife  help her sleep   mam's on these horse tranquillizers as it is     a light sleeper  aren't you  love    i have been     matthew    it's all right  he's asleep  in

gcses   doing what  drugs   no  travelling  bar work   he hasn't been home since the christmas before last  and he kipped over at his sister's on sunday night     then      murdered in the driveway  while keith mantel's holding a fundraiser  for our brave lads on the boats   taylor  i want details of his every movement  since he set foot back in the country     from where    amsterdam  ferry   so  where he went  who he met  talked to   phone calls   right  now     keith mantel  joe   family were a big noise on the docks   made a fortune out of ship building   with time they sold to a danish company   we can leave the danes out of it   so  keith mantel put all his capital into property   mantel's estate agents   when did you say he sold up family business   twelve years  maybe four months before abby's death   so  first abigail  now chris winter   right   copies of the old abigail mantel file     such as it is    you think same killer   that's a starting point   shall i have a word

the boot   i seem to recall that was your theory     you're the expert  pet    thank you  pet   look   victim's struck once on the back of the head   edge of the boot  this    rivet   it's enough to stun him but then comes blow number two   the death blow  cracked skull  internal haemorrhage   so  what hit him   flat surface  bloody hard  metal  i'm guessing   and look  traces of earth  mud  in his hair   holly  tell the crime scene mob  we're minus a murder weapon  priority   will do     time of death    fifteen  20 minutes  before your witness found him     right    you're welcome   billy

your demons   like i said to jeannie   i meant to ask   you'd have thought abigail's friendship with your daughter     yes  yes  i did point out the conflict   the prison service  they     they felt that the common ground  would actually do her good   the     dvd  was that of any use   sorry   excuse me  joe   csi found     this       in christopher winter's rucksack     very nice    no  inside

small  yet clumsy   me dad used to say   it's a pity  though  with your looks   plus now you're out of the force   what's that got to do with it   you and    keith mantel   the other night at the party in the garden   under the gibbous moon   i tell you  my radar's slow as it comes  but even i thought   hello  history    sorry  lost me   well  rich  good looking man  in bits over his dead lass   enter di fletcher  hormones raging   you kissed it all away  didn't you  all that pain   detective at 34  the darling of the acc   i wondered why you walked away from the job   you broke the golden rule     never get involved with a witness   i never touched him     not during    after   after you charged the wrong woman with murder   you see that lass he was with at the party   what is she  a model or what   why are you making this personal     what did i ever do to you    not me   her   the girlfriend he couldn't quite get rid of   what  i fitted up jeannie long now  did i   you were in too much of a hurry   you and your precious alibi  you would have done the same yourself   i mean  we had time wasters calling up every minute of the day   you can't act on every call  you can't     no  i was thinking more of abigail   sexually active  according to the autopsy   who with   not relevant   so  why didn't you take a statement from chris winter     he was 14 years old    despite the fact  he was only 400 yards from where abigail was murdered     he was in his room    he could have  climbed out the window  the family wouldn't have seen   you don't know that   look     what we found       in chris's wallet   my old business card  so what   he hung on to it all these years   look  direct line   that's    my number now  of course   and you know what else  he left a message   i thought it was for me but it wasn't  it was for you   do you want to hear it   listen  you won't remember me   i want you to know  whatever happens   i'm not here to judge you  i don't care for that   i'm just saying somebody's got to make a stand   cos that woman   jeannie long   her blood is on your hands   on all our hands   time to stop running   set us all free   your brother and abby   were they an item   mrs  bennett   sorry   i keep thinking i know your face     i can't      st joseph's     i was a year above    right   did i    did we know each other   i don't think so   no   still    i can't think there was anything to it   she was probably just flattered   though with abby  you never knew what was coming   it's why i liked her   she was fond of you   i was    starry eyed  captive audience   we'd sit on the beach with a couple of dad's ciggies  and watch the sun go down behind st george's   abby loved an audience   i was    going to the shops to get i don't know what  eggs   and i saw this    bright blue in the corn   i thought   i know that coat anywhere   and     i'm glad   i'm glad you were there   you know what it was like  that summer   yeah  i do   you know  sometimes it's like i'm still there   in that field   like    it was me who died and     all this just       something somebody made up in their head     mrs  bennett      sorry     i don't know where i am today    all right   james will be home any minute and i'll be fine   there he goes  like clockwork   ok   hypotheses   christopher winter murders abigail mantel     why    why  he's nuts about her   she's egging him on and he sees her from his bedroom window   out in the field by the house   and climbs out of the window to meet her  and     he makes a move  she laughs in his face   right   and he    well  he just loses it   kills her   strangles her  no less   and then back up the drainpipe   enter di fletcher   doesn't even interview him   sends jeannie down for murder inside    what  kenny    christopher winter takes off  first chance he gets   travels the world  suitcase full of snow globes   spool on ten years  come on  somebody  help me   erm  he reads about jeannie's death   he feels ashamed   you can't run for ever   nobody can   he comes back home to confess    at the party  maybe     at the party    with the whole community in view   but somebody gets to him first   somebody stops him from speaking out   who     cos once abby got wound up  nothing would have     stopped her   she was       don't you need to get off    no  i'll finish up here first   right  wait

didn't   i  sorry for what  mr  long     for killing abby mantel    hey   well  someone had to pay   me  i paid   the trial   tv  newspapers   neighbours don't want to know you   my wife     buried at 43   this doctor said   she looks like an old woman    she did  an' all   like a withered old woman   jeannie did that  our jeannie   but she didn't   next time     if there's a next time     you sit  you make your little notes  and you keep your mouth shut   ok     look  this is not about you    no  you're right     i just work so hard    i know you do     i just want you to      what   to say   well done    it doesn't matter   well  i'll just       let you     go give her nose a wipe  will you   ma'am  there's a call for you     right    di fletcher     where's joe    no idea   yes  it was a    it was a keepsake   it's mine  chris must have borrowed it  i supose   you didn't know he had it   no  not his style to ask   that's a bit selfish   we never really    got on much  so     but he was close to your wife   oh  yeah   emma romanticised him   the great wanderer   she always wanted to travel herself  so     can i have it back   well  once the trial's over  yeah   all right  right  course   how did he seem  chris  when he was staying here   he was     he did say sorry before he left  that was a first      sorry     yeah   tell her i'm sorry    meaning your wife   i don't know     hello    does your wife know     your little secret   who or what is james bennett  anyway   what if she were to find out   emma   it's just caroline was asking to see the room  weren't you   that's right   well  here we are  then   now  i may have been a lousy cop  but i do know about people   you hear that   wasps' nests   they come back every year  don't they  mary   they love our tiles right under the eaves   ok   well  i was asking  wasn't i  about      the summer we had the business with abigail   christopher was so afraid of them getting in   the wasps  it was like a phobia   and god  forbid anybody should open the window   it was so hot  i could hardly bear to come up here   the windows were rusted shut in the end   christopher was hardly going to climb out the window  was it   no  no  he wasn't   so he couldn't possibly have killed abigail  could he   so  ok  no murder  no guilty secret   no big public confession planned for keith's party   how'd you hear all that   kenny   it's called loyalty  look it up   what was that she said about christopher   nothing  nothing at all  pet   mrs  winter     mrs  winter    i was sound asleep   i'm sorry to barge in again  but your husband said something  about you wanting a change of scenery   now  those leylandii you have in the garden     yes  robert was dead      i was just wondering     against planting them  he said   can't we get new curtains    i said   i can't live in the dark    still  they've shot up   weeds  really  but they block out the view   the view   of where she died   so you had a clear view of the fields  did you   from the house     not from down here  no    but from upstairs   from the bedroom     where's joe    he's out and about  do you want     i was wrong   chris winter didn't kill abigail     sorry  what    he was a witness   there were no trees back then   he was up in his room and he saw what happened   he saw who did it   and would somebody mind telling kenny to go home     why    he's been onto caroline  fletcher about my investigation   transfer or suspension  his choice   tell him   what   i'm on me way   it wasn't that hard in the end   i just looked at the lab report for  the mud on the shoes and the shovel    unusual sandy texture    plus plenty of diverse pollen  pine pollen  especially   so i'm thinking   where was chris digging     pine forest    second one i tried     got lucky  really    no such thing   they're just up here   oh  i see   so     chris winter witnesses abigail's murder       buries something here  down one of these holes   then  11 years later   jeannie's death all over the news  back he comes   attack of conscience  says sorry to everyone he meets   and digs it back up again   there's proof  almost   the murder weapon that strangled abby   they never found it  did they   what if chris took it  buried it before the police arrived  to protect whoever murdered abby   you know  or some sort of     token or souvenir  he fancied her  didn't he     do you think that's possible    yeah  i do   you already worked that out  didn't you   not necessarily   about last night   i'm not meself   i don't know whether it's franny or       the new baby  you know    oh  yeah  i know   on third time round     you'd think we'd have it licked   i don't know why  it just seems so hard this time   it was so easy when we first met   just worn out  the pair of you   what you need is a break   ey  i am interested  pet  honest    it's a job  not a crusade    what's that from  fortune cookie   you  it's from you   it sounds like crap when you say it   is that right   wisdom is all about the execution   holly  yes   i ran james bennett through the pnc  like you said   and get this  he's down as having an alias     an alias

know  the business   till i sold up   and what happened then   he was let go   along with all the other lads   so you think the son's coming after you     broke into the house to hurt you    i didn't see him   ah  but you think so   and last night  you called to make a few choice threats   i hope you don't mind me asking     you've had the house to yourself  have you  since     since jeannie   i'm better off on me own   abigail make life difficult for you  did she   you and jeannie   not worth living   i was everything to that child   no mam   i was all the family she had  god help her   and when she turned 15     all grown up  so she kept telling me    i thought      get my life back now     my turn     jeannie can move in  why not     abby  she'll    take it in her stride     get that bitch out the house    or what   she didn't run to specifics   teenager  surely  amateur dramatics   not abby   she could be quite grown up when she needed to be   she was       hard work   listen

with the abduction   no  james bennett is not the killer   they're fine     and matthew    and matthew   thank you   that's quite a confession   you put this together   out of jeannie's own words   yes   to make her sound guilty   why   i used to do the school run   she and emma   i'd catch her in the mirror   her eyes   colour rising in her neck   one day she called me   one saturday in june    robert   she said  like that  like we were friends    robert  i've no money for the metro    give us a ride home    and how long      you two   the first time     i thought   she's using me for some sort of game    some private agenda  i felt so ashamed   and the second time i thought   no    no  she wants this    her needs   third time i thought      well      you're into the unknown    can you not say her name  even now   abby   abby   and the day of the murder   she called the house   i met her over in the field   it all came out   she said   i'm going to tell my dad     i've got to    you see  i was right   it was all a set up  a ploy   she didn't want me   she wanted to get back at her dad for bedding jeannie long   and so     so i killed her   mr  mantel   how     what    how'd you kill her   oh  with er    with string  you know  garden string     what did you do with it    burned it   yes   bring it over straightaway     mrs  winter    yes   mary  stay in the sitting room

been in a right panic to have left it there   she called the house   abby   mary   she called the house   i said    i've got a scarf     just like that one    she said   this is your scarf     he gave it to me    he took it    mary  why did your son take this scarf and bury it in the woods   what was it he saw     from his bedroom window   i strangled her       with my scarf   he is such a good man   and she was going to tear his good name apart   some silly little girl   my fault   ah  but you made up for it  pet  in your own way   twisting jeannie's words   turning her innocence into some cooked up confession to murder  just so you could bring it home  and play it to the wife   and put that big  bad dream of hers back in its box   but then jeannie died     back comes chris      enough     enough    your son   forced  finally  to saying it out loud     she can't hear this    it's the truth   you saw him at the party  then yes     standing by the garden gate    no   he had the scarf in the boot of his car   he wanted to tell the truth  set us all free   so you killed him   keep that secret buried   our lad   i had to protect you   i had to protect you   sweetheart  my sweetheart
