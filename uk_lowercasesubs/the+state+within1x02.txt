toss him over   luke gardner s death row appeal is before the supreme court this week   no  wait   ibrahim wahid  suspected of having links to the islamist movement of tyrgyztan     suspect bomber was a british national    give me strength   the governor of virginia is rounding up british muslims in his state   if governor norris believes that these suspects are a threat  he has my 100    support   in a statement this morning  governor norris repeated his regret  at the deaths of the two young british muslims  calling the incident a tragic accident   however  he stands by his belief that the enforced detentions  are a necessary and correct response   our reporter  glen laroche  is outside the british embassy in washington   glen  what s happening down there   well  as you can see  a large crowd of frightened british asians has gathered here   demanding their embassy give them sanctuary   the shooting of the young couple across the dc state line in winchester by national guardsmen  has spread terror through the entire british asian community   not just muslims  but hindus  sikhs   anyone who could be mistakenly identified and detained   now  i have been told that some in this community  have demanded their government get them home safely   while others are simply looking for information on loved ones  that have gone missing or that have been detained    could i have your attention  please  could i have your attention  quiet  please   i understand how distressing this situation must be for you all   whatever your request is  we will do our best to try to help you   but i need to ask you to be patient   you will all be seen  i give you my word   in the meantime  to avoid anyone getting hurt   i would ask you to wait calmly   we will try and process you as quickly as possible  thank you   you should be encouraging them to go back to their homes and their hotels     they don t feel safe out there    they are blocking massachusetts avenue     one incident  there will be widespread arrests    well  get the rest of them inside the compound   excuse me  would you   ladies and gentlemen  please  let me just     did you get the gator eats dog story     you could put it like that    it s unbelievable  isn t it     you wanna join me    can t  thanks   i gotta pick up luke s mom from the airport   and on to traffic news  where we ve got no big delays to report   some minor slowing on the i 75 southbound due to construction work     this is the end of the road   not if the supreme court grants his appeal today   and  god forbid they don t  then there s the pardons board   i ll either be taking luke home  or watching him die   when he was in the falklands  then i was worried  then i thought he might die   he won a medal for bravery  saved his mate s life   now these people want to kill him   what was he thinking  coming here   look at the place   first  it s back to tj barnes with the local news  i ll be back here in about a half an hour to keep     has anyone bothered to find out from this administration  whether these detentions are actually legal   the situation is unprecedented  depends on your definition of a terrorist suspect   here s what they re using now    any member of a sub group that intends to commit  or materially support terrorist activity can be detained      what    a british muslim has blown up a flight   therefore in governor norris  eyes  all british muslims are potential terrorist suspects     shall we    where s number 10 on this   i ve told the prime minister to postpone his visit   publicly  he can t appear to be attempting to interfere with the due process of us law   what due process   privately  i ve given the pm my personal assurance that this will be resolved swiftly   so  we don t know who s been detained  how long they ll be held for     even what rights they re allowed    exactly  brad  what s happening on the hill   the house and the senate have decided to form a joint homeland security committee   there s an emergency meeting tomorrow morning   where are the secretary of state and the attorney general on this   mcmanus and ziskin are talking now   but even if they rule governor norris  actions unjustified     that may not be enough    why not   because the security committee are threatening to introduce patriot act two   which would mean automatic denial of bail   and the detainees will have to prove that they are not terrorists     christ  they ll be dunking witches next    right  and then what   ethnic cleansing of all muslims   get me an in to the security committee  i need members who might be amenable     who s up for re election in the mid terms    there s chairperson madeleine cohen for one   madeleine  it s good to see you  difficult times   indeed  madam secretary     under secretary    senator   there s a fundraiser for the victims  families at the white house   i would love to have you and simon as my guests   well  that s very kind  but unfortunately i ve already bought my tickets   oh  well  then i look forward to seeing you there   excuse me   so  which way do you think she s gonna steer the committee     well  it s hard to say  she is a democrat    yes  but she s also a jew   thank you   thank you all     anything new on the bomb    no  i m waiting on the contact   madeleine cohen doesn t just bark  she bites   if you get on the wrong side of her  those british detainees  may not be released for months  in some cases years   it s a catch 22  phil  if i do nothing  the committee may still introduce patriot two     i have to do something    wait     see what they decide  then act    thank you   you wanna go and unpack  mrs gardner   we re not expecting to hear from the supreme court until 2 00     quiet everyone  quiet    sam levinson   i m sorry  i can t talk right now  we need to keep this line clear   levinson   i see  you absolutely sure   okay  thank you   the supreme court has denied the request for a stay  and denied luke s petition for a writ of certiorari   what does that mean   i m so sorry  jackie   vernon  no   no  no   i got him  i got him   ready   senator cohen s office called back   they re sorry  but there s no way they can schedule a meeting before the end of next week   yeah  i ll bet  all right  i ll take care of it   we ve just heard the supreme court has rejected luke gardner s application for appeal   shit     all right  get the consul to call me    right  list of calls   the foreign secretary is on his mobile   and you re supposed to be attending a dinner at caroline

gordon   runways  our base  tyrgyztan  delivery date is in 90 days   one minute over and armitage is in breach of contract   we re having some minor local difficulties     how s the pipeline    stalled   now  when we re talking minor local difficulties  we mean major presidential recalcitrance   president usman wants to renegotiate his deal   as if he hasn t got enough in his cayman accounts   god damn it  i kept that man in power   when i ran armitage  when i told that meathead to jump  he jumped   he s not the same kiss ass he was seven years ago  lynne   he s america s backdoor into

well  i don t need your respect  i need runways   if you and armitage aren t up to the job  then you can forget our past history   now  if you will excuse me  i have a national security crisis to deal

thanks for your time  phil  i appreciate it     coffee    yeah   i ve got a john doe in a creek in fairmont county  pathologist reckons he s british     what makes him think that    amalgam fillings   pretty sharp for fairmont county   yeah  well  the tattoo on his butt reading  made in britain  might have nailed it   and i take it  by your presence  he didn t simply fall in   no  i got it  no  he was shot with a high velocity weapon   stripped and then dumped upstream  we have an exit wound for one bullet   and it looks like a second round originally lodged in his spine     originally    yeah  it was dug out   his finger tips were removed  and then his face was blown off with a 12 gauge   so someone s gone to a lot of trouble to make our job difficult   have you got someone checking our missing person files here     we ve also sent dna to scotland yard    you might want to send it to the mod as well   the last time i saw a  made in britain  tattoo  it was on a soldier   you ll get them back when they re inventoried   the state governor has set the date for your execution for midnight on the 16th   four days from now   you are now in phase two of deathwatch   have you notified the prison authorities as to your choice of execution   yes   you will be taken to x wing   a guard will remain outside your cell  visits from family remain contained   legal visits  however  will now be contact   that s all  mr gardner     excuse the fingers    good health   i feel a bit guilty enjoying a drink when luke s inside   to luke   one of the things i miss   luke always brought me a bottle of duty free from his trips abroad   sounds like he loves his mum   he gives off like he s really hard  but i know it s all a front   did you see much of him after he left the army   not as much as i d like   i got postcards   i ve got cards from indonesia  thailand   cape town  pakistan  dubai     how could he afford to travel so much    he got jobs   construction worker  doorman  stuff like that   he loves meeting new people   well  he did   he always was a restless soul   hi  thanks for coming     how are you doing    okay     something smells great    yeah  come in   mark     glad you could make it    gordon     want some wine    yes  please     there you go    why don t we go through     it s good to see you  mark    was this your idea   it was the only way to get you into the same room together   by what  deliberately misleading me   mark  if you re gonna yell at somebody  yell at me   armitage is one of the companies i advise on central asia     this has nothing to do with      they have been involved in tyrgyztan  for over eight years  they are not a corporation that just take the profit and run   mark  do you have any idea how many local guys we employ down there   i mean  hell  yeah  we re making big bucks for the us   but when usman starts cutting up  it isn t just armitage that suffers   and right now my contacts in karaz are telling me  that usman s in the market for some new best friends   the us administration has to seriously reappraise its allegiance to usman   they should be talking to the democratic opposition movement     god s sake    it s not like this is news to you  mark     what do you want    as you know  eshan borisvitch is in hiding   james has been in regular contact with him   eshan is scared  and there are very  very few people he trusts   and if it can be arranged   he s interested in having secret discussions with the us administration   but only if you broker the talks     me    yes     he s your brother in law    i m an alcoholic ex diplomat with zero rating   you are in a unique position to get eshan out of hiding and into power   i m a servant of the british government     and we support president usman    you re the pm s closest advisor   you know exactly what position you d be putting me in   eshan is prepared to risk his life coming over here  and you re worried about your position   you ll excuse me if i don t stay for dinner     mark  can we please talk about it    mark     how dare you do that to me    do what  tell the truth   you were badly wrong once  you re closing your eyes again   stop making it personal  that s where you went wrong  you made everything personal   who would you rather see as president of tyrgyztan  eshan or usman   it s not about what i want     there are people dying in the streets    and there are brutal regimes across the worid   saida was murdered   and if they d found azzam  they d have shot him  too   you have no evidence usman was involved   saida would have been pleading with you to do this   if you can t show me any respect  at least have some for your dead wife   you owe eshan  you owe me this  put it right   christ alive  mark  i remember when you had a soul   i ve seen you cry for god s sake   sometimes in this job  the best thing to do isn t always the right thing   self serving bullshit  the same bullshit that got usman elected in the first

corporations employing over two million people  have massive contracts to supply middle eastern countries   now  do you seriously think that even jordan will continue to do business with the us  if fellow muslims are being rounded up simply on the grounds of religion   the next time a british muslim detonates himself in an idaho shopping mall   i and members of my committee will be held personally accountable   and you don t think you ll be accountable if major industries in california go bust   if  god forbid  the middle east stops supplying america with oil   you know  the  tough on terror  ticket isn t the re election guarantee it once was     are you questioning my motives  ambassador    i m just trying to protect innocent british citizens   if you push through this act  where does it end   the detention of all muslims in america  sikhs  catholics  jews   i m sure you re well aware of the reichstag fire decree of 1933   are you accusing me of being a nazi   i m just

1981  the son of central asian immigrants     he disappeared in the late  90s    when he became ibrahim wahid the jihadist   looks that way  when he re emerges  he s using both identities   as khan  he s a freelance it consultant  working across europe and the states   isn t he taking a hell of a risk having this kind of incriminating data on his laptop   certainly not usual terrorist behaviour   so    not now   i think you want to hear this  mcmanus and ziskin have ruled the detentions illegal   have we heard how the homeland security committee s responded   any moment now  apparently  it s pretty heated   the homeland security committees of both houses are ever mindful of their duties  to protect the citizens of this country   in our desire to keep the land we love safe   we could find ourselves setting down precedents  that may impact on our freedoms in the future   with that in mind  the committee has agreed not to push for further legislation  that could lead to the detention of persons based solely on nationality  race or religion   that said  the committee has begun a total review of all security measures   we propose checks on all freight cargo entering and leaving the us to be tightened     all screening procedures for visa applications      cowards      to be overhauled   the 30 minute seating rule on all flights to be re instated  thank you   nasreen speaking  are
