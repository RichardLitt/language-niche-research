at each other  so     we didn't miss  i'll sort it   whatever's happened  i'll deal with it  what d'you think has happened   i mean  it was just gas  wasn't it   that can't be too bad  can it   right  because gas never did anyone any harm  on the plus side  we've got good evidence  relatively undamaged   on the downside  there's an alien on the loose   we don't know where it is  why it's here or what it's going to do   give her a break  god  this has been the worst first day ever   we all make mistakes  now we find and recover whatever came out of there   this might help  nightclub death been phoned into 999   circumstances sound    a little unusual   might be connected   torchwood   gwen  hi   bloody hell  look at you  all posh   special ops  we were wondering   i meant to call   it's been a bit of a whirlwind  go on  then  tell us all  coming   yeah  sorry   you can get away now  no point you freezing your arse off out here   boss of me now  are you   say hi to everyone for me   this is all that's left   how's that possible  the question is how did you know this used to be a body   go on  son  with you all the way   bit of a shock  i tell you   we need to see that cctv   wow  oh  my god  he just    came and went   that's the way i'd like to go   i'm sure we could arrange it  how can that be   it doesn't make any sense   it's not possible  do you know the girl's name   did they arrive together or meet in the club   is she a regular  would any of the other staff know her  i dunno   we get hundreds of people here every weekend   i don't keep tabs  thanks for your help   we've got all we need   what are you talking about  we haven't got a clue  we don't even know her name   we need a body from the cryo chamber  close match for the dead guy   disfigure the face  dump it someplace remote  make it look like a suicide attempt   you have a stash of bodies   what about his family   you can't just fake his death  you want to tell his family  he died screwing an alien  we don't know for sure   same elements recorded at the crash site   traces all over the club but strongest in this area   something happened here   it's my fault   if it weren't for me  he'd still be alive   that'll get you nowhere  that thinking   at least now we know a little more   the alien's taken on a host body   we can't let her kill again   i said to them  you're putting yourselves out of work  behaving like this   i can get five polish lads who don't take any breaks   happy as sand boys  all for 56 quid above board   i told niall  i said   why should i bother with your moaning mates when i can get this    carys  dad   hangover from hell  is it   what did you get up to last night   i can't really remember   mullered  i was   gotta go   tony needs the van by nine   you in tonight   what's this supposed to do  i'm using satellite tracking data  to determine the inward trajectory of the meteorite   he means he's trying to find out where it's came from   sometimes techno babble is good for the soul  so this is a route planner   not far off   rhys  my boyfriend  is a transport manager  he does this sort of stuff   on a slightly smaller scale  though  you have a boyfriend   yeah  have you  don't have time with this job   what about you  you seeing anyone  you've gotta be joking   i can get all the grief i need here   none of you have partners   just you  newbie   i'm not being rude or anything    well  maybe i am  but     how do you switch off from all this stuff   what do you do to relax   i torture people in happy relationships   she sobs  gas traces confirmed as vorax and suranium   my two favourite gases  can we do a check  and find out what we know about them   i'm all over it  what's this doing   i've taken an image of the girl from the cctv  this cross checks her face with the uk population   you can't have every face in the uk on there   that would be against civil liberties  data protection     still doing that  you  instead of  we  thing    it's supposed to give us a single match   the cctv was too low res  i've tried magnifying and augmenting but it just breaks up   the software can't function properly  it's narrowed the numbers down   i could check through the rest  the old fashioned way   with my eyes   what about the fingerprints i took off the alley wall   it was a long shot  anyway  just a bit   least i'm trying to do something  you're trying anything   the cctv must have picked up her arrival at the club   tosh  can you reformat the image recognition software  to trace her journey backwards via street cameras   it'll take a while to process   every possible turn means thousands of probabilities   have a go  at least we'll know where she started   we could cross reference that with the remaining face matches   good one  newbie  that's a bit more like it   ah   ah   no   doorbell rings  you're keeping our website in business   well  your  er  dad's not in  then   get your clothes off  steady  carys   all right  that's enough   joke over  barry's put you up to this  has he  shut up   what's going on   put your trousers on and get out  now   it always breaks my heart to say those words  air quality's ok   gwen  look out   what's that  it's a sort of inflatable cell   power runs down after an hour  the battery life's bollocks   who said you could use that  um  i just stopped a prisoner escaping   you know the rules  none of that stuff leaves the building without my permission   fine  don't thank me   come with us   see what you can find out from her  but aren't you going to help me   i don't know what i'm doing   usually better if you don't say that in front of the prisoner   are you mi5   where am i  what do you want   i think you know  carys   how d'you know my name  i've never been in trouble   what do you want from me   i know there's something living inside you  and i know what it made you do  his name was matt stevens   his parents lost their only child at 3 07 this morning   ah  ah   you broke my ship   come on then  where are you from  and why are you trying to invade earth  you can forget about enslaving us   who said anything about enslaving   well  that's what you lot do  aliens  isn't it   no  i just want the energy   the climax   i live off that energy   right  sorry  just to recap   you've travelled here to feed off orgasmic energy   there's nothing else out there like it   you taste so good   you're the best hit there is  ah  ah  no   help me  please  get it out of me   carys   hel lo   happy birthday  me   ok  first contact with an alien   not quite what i expected   oi  you lot   treat   whoa  wow   she said she had a boyfriend   you people and your quaint little categories   we should really get her out of there   yeah  i mean  yeah  come on   just   record a bit first   no  it's no good   it's got to be a man   ah  oh   i'm losing   promise me you'll help me   promise me   mobile phone rings  i promise   hi   you're not still at work  'fraid so   'what time will you be done ' not sure when i'll be finished   is it exciting  though  have you had loads of excitement  erm  some   er sorry  yeah  is now a good time   em  maybe not the best   oh  pity me  i'm a special ops widow   i'll call you later   'bye '  way to go  newbie  that is what i call a methodical investigation   i can't wait to see you take down her particulars   what are you doing   get off me   that girl's body is being overrun by i don't know what  and you think it's a joke   all right  jesus  i'm sorry  we should be helping her   she's not some lab rat  no  she's a murderer   you were the one who wanted her caught   how come suddenly she's your best friend   you know  strictly speaking  throttling the staff is my job   so who's for chinese   and she said      if i'd known that's what he was  i never would have married him    she knew all along  she didn't care   until he started leaving black piles of mucus in the bathtub   always the big giveaway  aliens have no sense of household hygiene   which reminds me  gotta pee   so what's he told you  what about   himself  you've been here longer than i have  we were banking on you   you're a copper  trained to ask questions  you don't know anything   not who he is  not where he's from  nothing  except him being gay   no  he's not  really  do you think   owen does  i don't   and i don't care   period military is not the dress code of a straight man   i think it suits him  sort of classic   exactly  i've watched him in action  he'll shag anything if it's gorgeous enough   we know he's from america  right  we don't know that for sure   no us citizen by the name of jack harkness born in the last 50 years   maybe his identity's classified   used to be something big in the cia  that's what i reckon   he must have his reasons for wanting to keep things secret   sure he has  doesn't stop me wanting to know what they are   woman sobs  what's that sound   woman sobs  what are we doing having chinese while a girl fights for her life   actually  while we've been eating  the computers have been running a full bio scan on carys   profiling her blood  metabolism  organs  skin  the works   so we can see what effect the alien's having on her  they've also been  taking samples of the air in the cell so we can analyse changes in the environment around her   now  is that enough  do you want more   cos it gets kinda boring   you've been hidden down here too long   spending so much time with the alien stuff  you've lost what it means to be human   so remind us   tell me what it means to be human in the 21st century   all right   carys fletcher  born 13th november  1987   school reports  personnel files from her temping agency   swimming badges  reports of her mother's death in a car crash   and emails discussing the merits of orlando bloom and heath ledger   why have you done this  this isn't about meteorites or gases  we have a trapped girl  and we have to save her  when i was with her in the cell  carys told me she was losing   we have to find a way to keep her fighting   remind her to hold on to who she is   have i got something on my face   no   just  it's   brilliant   you are brilliant   thank you   so we should bring in her dad   you're kidding  we've got to find something to connect with her   make her fight back  our priority is to contain the alien threat   not put civilians in a cell with it  we should be helping her   if we don't  who will  jack  are you always this awkward   'you should take a look at this '  this is the normal chemical composition of the air in that cell   and these are the readings from the last hour   the alien's secreting an ultra powerful blend of airborne pheromones   sex pheromones  anything we'd normally experience   she's a walking aphrodisiac   i did wonder why i    actually  i sort of snogged her   both  we know   now  still wanna put her father in the cell   god  no  we can't let any man near    owen   jack  carys is out of her cell   cheeky bitch took my swipe card   'i'll deal with it  and tell owen he needs to work on those abs a bit harder '  i was taking some readings  you know  keeping an eye on her  and bang  you got away lightly   be thankful she was only interested in your swipe card  are you all right now   or are you still feeling a bit of a cock   no exit  sorry   yeah  you want a little rough and tumble   well  let's make it a fair fight   you won't stop me   put it down  that's worthless to anyone but me   down now  or i'll shoot   says he will but the eyes say he won't  i'm going  don't stop me   please help me   need me to do any attacking  sir  appreciate the offer  just open the door   now give me the jar   no   after all i said  a severed hand is more important to you than carys' life   you want to prove yourself   find her  get your old pals in the police to do something useful for once   all right  i'll give them a call   put out an apb    woman possessed by gas knobbing fellas to death   oi  you'd better get in here   so i'm trying to interpret the results of the bio scan   yeah  but it's just a mess  like there's no definitive readings   because everything in her body keeps changing   nothing stays constant  as soon as you think  you've got something clear  the metabolic rate  the blood pressure all goes wild again   she's fighting the alien for control of her body   so anyway  i decided to do a comparative diagnostic   recreate the circumstances   accelerate the process a little  see what's gonna happen to carys  yeah  thanks   i infected the rat with a combination of the vorax and  suranium gas traces we found at the crash site and the nightclub   looks fine so far   once the gases start to flow round the body  the party really starts   the heart rate triples  the brain swells  pressing against the skull   then the lungs began to shrink  making it impossible to breathe   the pressure increases on all the internal organs until     rat jam  that's what's gonna happen to carys    i'm losing   that's what she said to me  right now  it's a struggle  between where carys ends and the alien begins   we have to think like her   put ourselves in her place  it's the only way to find her   except we don't know what her controlling impulse is by now    carys or the alien inside  the last thing i saw was a fight for control   the overriding factor for the parasite is to have sex   it's a survival instinct   that's bound to be the strongest drive   all right  so you're carys  you're desperate for sex cos that's what the thing inside you needs   but you know it will kill  where would you go   i'd come round and shag you   what   it's a joke  can't i have a joke with my team mates  right now  no   so what are we talking about  brothels  lap dance clubs   anywhere there's eager men   i know what i'd do   what the hell are you doing here  you look a bit wired   i had to see you  you should've called  bethan might've been in   i could kill you  i could bloody kill you   what the hell was that message you left on my mobile last night  sounded like you were off your face   if i wanted to  i could kill you   now   look  i've told you   i'm not leaving bethan  you're a lovely girl  but it's just not gonna happen   you were my first  see   i never told you cos i thought you'd laugh   and you're crap   all you want is to come and you don't care what's underneath   go on  have a go  get it out of your system  ah   do you love me  eddie   did you ever love me  no   you could've saved yourself   what   we're too late   tosh was right  though  she went for the ex boyfriend   lucky she's young   work your way through my back catalogue  we'll be here till the sun explodes   where next  and how long before that thing destroys her body   so what's our next move  stop the entire city of cardiff from shagging   put bromide in the water supply  no  too hit and miss   the water company got pissed off last time we did that   it could have used any body in cardiff  why her  i just assumed it was random   it's mining carys' life to get what it needs  what else do we know about her   anything you can think of  what are you all looking at me for   you did all the profiling  i don't know  sorry   she's great under pressure   there's gotta be something  what did you say carys' job was   she's just a temp  receptionist   where's she working at the moment  i can pull her employment files up   conway clinic  you're joking  what's the problem   it's a bloody fertility clinic  sperm donors   an unlimited supply of orgasmic energy without all the build up  perfect hit   ah  carys  you're not on today  are you   it needs more  the energy   it's not lasting   sorry   'mr tunstall  room number one's ready now '  man screams  what's this for  need a diagram  i've never used a gun   you were in the police   i was on the beat  i'll make sure you don't need to use it   i'm asking for you to get out  relax  i can help  i don't think so  love  i'm gay   what do we do if we find her   how are we going to get it out of her  judging by the test results   the gas needed a host because prolonged exposure to our atmosphere is poisonous to it   but our bodies are the perfect environment   if we isolate it from carys' body     it won't survive for long  sounds like we have a plan   force it to die   just like it did those poor blokes   what about carys  better start praying  we get to her in time   come on   out  now  get as far away as you can   god  how many more   in here   nowhere to run   all this sex  all we see  all we think   so much beauty   and so much fear   we want it but we're so afraid of it    ah   the strain on her body's too much   any second now  she's rat jam  one more and i'll be strong   each time  it works less   each time  the feeling's weaker   one more  make me feel alive   make me feel human   i can't   i can   jack  i've got a surplus of alive   i'm giving it away   you really want to feel something   what's he doing   that was just the kiss  imagine the buzz you get from the rest   wasn't exactly the reaction i anticipated  her body won't last much longer   use me   leave carys  take my body as host  just let her live   gwen    i'm stronger than she is   i'll last longer  you might be able to save me  i don't know   ok  jack   you can't let her  like she said   she's responsible for this   come on  then  do it  leave her   how long can it survive in there   it was pretty weak  why   bit worried how long that battery'll last for   look    it's dying   you travel halfway across the universe for the greatest sex   you still end up dying alone   thank you   still here   everybody else is off doing   whatever it is they do when they're not here   how long have you been there   i wanted to finish off   do one thing for me   don't let the job consume you  you have a life  perspective  we need that   who are you  jack   i'm sorry  you can't die  you tell me the 21st century is when it all changes   that we have to be prepared  you do   but how can you know  you think knowing the answers would make you feel better   who are you  what are you doing here   go home  gwen cooper  eat lasagne   kiss your boyfriend   be normal   for me   so i said  those bloody website     i've had years of experience   i know the journeys  i've driven most of them  i know the best way   am i
