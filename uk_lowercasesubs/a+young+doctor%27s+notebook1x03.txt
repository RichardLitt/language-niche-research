all morning   abandoning medicine is the best decision i have ever made   the whole world is sick  what good can a doctor do   but then i did not score fifteen fives in the public examinations as you did   i was never destined to become a great doctor as you are   apologies again for not writing sooner   but i trust this letter finds you well and in good spirits   and i hope that some of this unseasonably warm petrograd weather     makes it to your neck of the woods   happy birthday  jurov   it was my birthday three weeks ago         and it was wretched    right  he sent it four weeks ago  but      you know what the post is like   even letters don't want to be sent here   come on     i'm sure it's only a matter of time before the greetings cards come     flatting in   and you know what mother is like   she's     well  she's got a lot of children     have you seen the cigarettes    in the drawer     i feel nauseous    yeah i don't feel too special myself   i hope it's just

nothing but snow   and that was three weeks ago    what did you do in the revolution  father    revolution     what revolution  nobody asked me about a revolution   i helped stupid peasants in a small hospital outside a         tiny village in the middle of nowhere   are there really  no cigarettes   not now   mmmh    right   i'm    i'm going to the shop     the shop    yes  to buy cigarettes and a newspaper     would you like anything    you do know where the shop is  don't you     no  i don't  where is it    grachevka   it's half a day there  and half a day back   right  ehm     i'd better pack     going to anywhere nice    no   actually  i don't    i don't know  is grachevka nice  i doubt it   oh  yes   the bright light of grachevka    i'm told it hangs outside of the house of the postmaster   you should ask for help to pack   i said you'd not see out the winter   no  no  i'm just off to grachevka   not in this weather   yes  but it's always this weather  isn't it   if i wait to the snow to melt i'll never set the foot out of the hospital  will i   come on  it's not that ridiculous for a man to travel to grachevka   for a man  no  but you will freeze to death   we're out of cigarettes and i need to read a newspaper    you want to go to the shop   yes   but don't tell me that's  ridiculous to go to a shop     yes  the shop is closed    what time does it open   august

the provisions come   and pinch of tobacco   don't forget i've ordered a case of pickles sprats   we've still have a birthday to celebrate  i can't do that  and i barely can turn this up  while this one         it is absolutely right   it's battling  but then    i'm not a doctor  am i   you are   right    oh yes  definitely   i'm just     can't quite decide what's the best course of action to take   gargle or     the drops   would the gargle work on my elbow   you're right   good point  drops it is   is that the stomach pains  again   no  no     i just finished  i see   i'm sure  if you do

dead    her throat is blocked  how long she's been like this   five days   five days   do you realize you almost certainly killed her   what you've been doing for five days   there's nothing to do around here  for one day   do you have a newspaper   i can't read   five days  you stupid witch  now it's my problem   do you have cigarettes   typical  bring her in    god  you just give her drops   drops   what is it with you people and drops  drops do nothing   doctors only give drops when they have no idea know what else to do   is there anything in there   oh  dear     well  she's dying  i

to let the doctor operate   fine   no consent  no operate  fine by me   or  perhaps you'd like another five days     to think about it   what are you doing   nothing  i just though i'd clean up   you ain't got any trousers on   right  no  this yeah     i had a little accident   did you know the mangle is broken     i do now    doctor     doctor    what have i done now   your attempt seems to have worked    this time     they consented    yes    great   that's all i need   inject the camphor   oh god  you know  i really think i might have appendicitis   oh don't be silly   it's probably just gas   i didn't give consent  she did   give her more chloroform   i gave her enough to nockout a horse   there's enough left to knockout an elephant   what are you doing  these are my going out trousers   only clear pair i could find   and going out where  i don't think the bolshoi is coming to grachevka   i don't know if you're right there    ah   you keep doing that   now i am     i don't think i can do this   it's only a tracheotomy     you cut ope the throat      oh no  no  i mean all of this   hours and hours of staring at the snow  only interrupted by bora   i long for a knock at the door that is not a dying patient  but     the dean of faculty   and he regretfully informs me of a clerical error   turns out i don't have 15 fives  in fact i failed all of my public examination   i scored a record low   and then he strips me my medical degree and i'm banished from this place and     as punishment  i'm forced to return to the bright lights and         the happiest sounds of moscow   well  they'll strip you your medical degree  if you'll let too many patients die on the operating table   really   no  i can't do that   how many is too many   nope  that's not what you meant       you can't let her die    i'm not going to kill her      or let her die     come on  come with me    no   all right  all right  there you go   i have a fever        and i'm in so much pain i feel that not even the magnificently bearded         leopold leopoldovic would be able to help me   what are you looking at     are you sure yo're gonna to be able to do this  doctor    no   but there's no one else  is that  there's no other doctor for a hundred verstes   but that's not true  is it   i know three at nikolskaya  so there's no other doctor for 87 verstes   but i take your point   she's beautiful   gauze  gauze     stop  mother    you call yourself a doctor   oh well it's an interesting distinction actually  i'm a field doctor     it's not in here   she doesn't have a windpipe   i can't    i can't find it   it's not in here   it doesn't make any sense  it's not like this in medical textbooks   where is it   you might want to use a bigger knife   he's a murderer   that you did willfully     and with malicious forethought     stab a girl to death     i was trying to help her    you stabbed her three times   but i'm a doctor  and i think i have a stomach tumor   you're not a doctor   you're a murderer   a ripper   i hereby declare  you are no longer fit to practice medicine   thank you   your honour  thank you   there it is   hooks  feldsher  hooks   ah  thank you  mother

 he's not the sprat man   you said you wanted to get out of the hospital   doctor  over here   what are you doing out here   this is no place to give birth   my father wouldn't give me the horse   he said  you're a healthy woman  it's only five verstes   he needs the horse     it's in transverse lie  doctor    right   podalic version   it's all right   he has done this once before   i broke his arm   come on  doctor  you have no reason to feel bad   he was already dead   i'm not a butcher     i am a murderer   i don't take this anymore   what are you doing   what does it look like     you don't want to do that    why not   doesn't it work     no  no  it works    then i'm doing it   it has to be better than dough and drops   you have no idea what you're doing   i am a doctor  i can handle it   no you can't   you only think you can because you've never taken it   it's a medicine  i    i give this to children   only if you want to saw off their legs     i'm in so much pain    then suffer   because this  is far worse   it will take you      to a lush meadow with the high summer where you lie in the soft grass   and bask in the sun   and feel nothing but bliss   and you will never want to return to this frozen pisshole in the snow   i have to get out of here   it will never this good again   ah  it's incredible   i    i have never seen anything like it   i    i have loss of words   it's moments like these i dreamt of in medical school   i can't find absolutely no sign of infection whatsoever   it's undoubted that your husband is in an advanced stage of syphilis  and yet     you're untouched   great  it's so nice to be able to give a patience good news for once   that lying bastard   i hope the dirty pig dies a slow painful death   he will   ehm    pickle sprat
