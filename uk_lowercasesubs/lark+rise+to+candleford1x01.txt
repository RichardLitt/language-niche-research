there were always skylarks  their songs hanging over the fields of dark gold   as a child  it felt as though this quiet old country life had always been so   and would always be so   my father used to say that nobody ever came to lark rise  and nobody ever left   but he was wrong on both counts   come on  not long  not long   take a little breath  take a little breath  so close    there we are boys

transcript  evarin transcript uk  sync  moochie  do you ever wonder why we were born on this spot here  alf   well  because we were   but we might have been born somewhere else   and we wouldn't have

back with them   i was so excited   it was going to be a whole new life   it was all arranged   till the night before i was due to go  they began to talk about snakes that infested their garden  so   i said   i shan't go    and i wouldn't   but the truth of it is  laura   it was more than snakes i was afraid of   and i still find myself wondering   what if    do you see  my flower   i've put a potato cake in a bag for you   a little bit of sugar can always be spared   no child of mine shall go out into this world without a good outfit   for your writing  laura   thank you  edmund   walk on

lay on such a spread every day   it's a feast   we thought it would be a warm welcome for laura   didn't we  zillah   are you a christian  missie   even if that were any of your business  thomas brown   we should not discuss such lofty matters at my table   laura  meet matthew  who runs the forge for me   perhaps tomorrow morning mrs macey and thomas brown here   can show you how we sort the mail

you hear me  thomas  telegram for mrs arless over in lark rise   so it began   one little telegram bearing a few words of good news  was about to set hamlet against town   rich against poor   lark rise against candleford   wouldn't it be splendid to have your very own nine gallon cask  of good ale in your pantry   turn on the tap and fetch a glass for your husband   or better still  he can fetch one for me   and you'll have plenty of time to pay for it   just put your instalment by each week for me to come and collect   now  who's gonna to be the very first in lark rise  to own their own cask of best foaming beer   what are you upto   ma  ma  wake up   the little 'uns are after their dinner   argh  i'm burning     who sleeps here    you do     who else    no one else  'tis your room   my own room   this is a home  not a farmyard   you're in candleford now  gal   go on  over to emma s   put your best hungry faces on  just stand by the door   don t say i sent you   i know what you're thinking  i shouldn't have spent your wages on the beer   i was feeling in need of cheering up  that's all   i miss your pa more than you realise   i've learnt my lesson   see it in my face if l haven't   ain't you the beautiful one   don't you fret    little laura won't forget you   we might fret about feeding the little 'uns before anything else   you got any more work in the field tomorrow   some more ditches to be dug out  another week or more   good lad   dorcas   timothy    oh  how sweet of you     are they from the manor gardens    ah  this is  er   this is rather difficult you see  i  i've promised these to zillah   she dropped the most enormous hint the other day   yes  there's no missing zillah's intimations   i saw thomas setting off just now with a scowl from ear to ear   he has a telegram to deliver to lark rise  you know how he loves to suffer   i take it from your dress that you are not riding out with me today   a new girl has arrived  laura  emma timmin's eldest child   she's very spirited and rather lovely with it   i'd like to see her properly settled in   i've left her to get acquainted with zillah's brand of welcome   well  tomorrow then   yes  i'd love to   telegram for mrs arless   telegram  who from   three and six for the hire of man and horse carriage   well  i can see the horse carriage  but i can't see no man     i see you've not found christ yet    no   and i've not found three and six neither   in which case  in accordance with post office regulations     i cannot deliver this telegram    oh   don't be so heartless  man   it might be from my daughter  who's pregnant   when the young 'uns begin  it's about time the old 'uns stopped   well  it's a bit late for that now  isn't it  thomas   or that might be about my walter       that might be news of his ship    that might indeed   and if you hadn't wittered away the earnings he sent you  on vices such as ale   you might have the means to find out   you stay here a while  i'll get your money for you   ma  what are you doing   well  we have to know what's in that telegram  don't we   that's well enough me lending it you  how you going to find it to pay me back   please  mr paxton  they wouldn't be sending me no telegram  unless it was terrible bad news  would they   go on  please   this is the last time and i mean it   they're charging hamlet folk what amounts to a day and a half's wages  for a few words on a piece of paper   they're charging for the distance   candleford post office say we're outside their eight mile limit   that's them getting paid twice   they're taking the food off our tables and the clothes off our backs   they want to take us for no more than country fools   right's right and wrong ain't right   we're not outside of no limit   milestones might say we are  maps might say we are   but we all walk to and from and we know what eight mile is   we ought to do something about it   all i want is my money back and a fair share of what's right   you know  somebody ought to ruffle their feathers  and let them know they've been ruffled 'n' all   we should write a letter  to the post master general hi'self   what do you think  robert   that's something about our lucy   won't cost me another three and six for you to read it  will it    your daughter did give birth today to a fine baby girl     mother and child are both in good health    thomas brown  we should raise a drop of ale in the blessedness of it   if you ask me  the blessed thing to do would be to abstain   well  the beer's here and this is certainly something worth celebrating   it may take a little while  but she'll settle   we'll settle too   we're not the first family to send their daughter out into the world   it's done  robert   it is done  isn't it  robert   i suppose it is  if you say it is   i wrote it all down  everything i saw and heard   my mother always said even small things never passed unnoticed by me   are you all settled in  laura     yes  i am  thank you    good  then you need your sleep   you have a big day tomorrow   was that lady adelaide we saw today  ma'am   it was  yes   and impossibly beautiful  don't you think   yes     i heard she was from london    yes   but now she is married to sir timothy   whose family have given us our squire for hundreds of years   that means we must love lady adelaide and cherish her   she is one of us now   and tomorrow you may meet her     does she come into the post office    no   i don't suppose her ladyship has much need of a penny stamp   she won't come to you  laura  but you will go along to the manor   you must go to see sir timothy and be sworn in   no one can work for the post office until they have signed the declaration   it wasn't so much the words she spoke about lady adelaide   as the look in miss lane's eyes as she said them   i'm joining you today  miss lane   i'm curious what it is you two gossip about   if only it was so diverting   timothy has engaged me in the same conversation  since we were ten years old   well  i am no rider but  erm   i promised timothy that i would make an effort after all this time   the poor horse knows when there's a city girl in the saddle   timothy  you talk such back wood nonsense   you ride so well  dorcas   i have watched you  many times   walk on       how about a juicy little kiss then    i will not   all we did was trot around saying  hello  to your tenants  and yet you came back from those jaunts so much sunnier   at least now you know you're not    missing anything   and what have you been up to  young lady  poaching   rick burning  or is it petty larceny  i look gravely upon petty larceny   forgive me  laura  i couldn't resist   you looked so full of dread standing there  come in   dorcas has  um     miss lane has told me all about you  please     ah  there we are   the declaration   which even the most humble of candidates for her majesty's service must sign  before a magistrate     i am the magistrate    yes  sir   i know who you are   wait     you must never put your name to anything before you read it  laura   you might sign away your fortune  now  what does it say    i do solemnly promise and declare that i will not open  or delay     or cause or suffer to be opened or delayed     any letter or anything sent by post    and do you   solemnly promise to be a servant of her majesty's post office   bound by its many codes and statutes     i do  sir    then now you may sign it   very well read it was  too   you should do well with miss lane  she is an excellent woman   erm  efficient  i mean     and respected     and kind to those of whom she approves   your eyes are young  laura   let's hope they will never be dimmed     by crying   you tell him  that letter's from all of lark rise   mr paxton  i'm afraid there are regulations  that govern even what the post master general can do   you ask him  how are folks supposed to afford it  eh   on ten shillings farm wages   right's right and wrong ain't right   how can you be so sure lark rise is inside of the eight mile limit   there's folk in the hamlet understands these things   it's in their feet you might say   and that's for certain that ain't no eight mile   i well  i will certainly forward this to the post master general for you   we're being treated as poor relations to candlef0rd's jumped up ways   and that ain't right   no one can ever say that lark rise is against her majesty   god bless her  can they  laura   it ain't candleford's fault that those country savages send each other  telegrams about every silly something or nothing   without a thought about how it's going to be paid for   do you suppose you could spare a crust of loaf  emma   i ain't got a morsel of bread and the young 'uns is half starved   you can't bring your children up on borrowed bread  caroline   oh  listen to you  duchess of lark rise   well  i wouldn't be much of a neighbour if i said nothing  and your borrowing landed you in the debtors' prison   i shall feather the foam   the time to stop living is when you're dead  thank you     thank you    thank you  miss lane   laura  is there a letter for miss midwinter     thank you    there you are   'tis churning day on the farm today  miss lane   thank you  zillah  then i should like to take a bath tonight   like i said  you're in candleford now  girl   that young lady who came in to collect the letter       miss midwinter        she's a cousin of sir timothy's   and the letter is from a handsome farmer's boy   intoxicatingly handsome   it will never do  of course   the poor boy doesn't have so much as a penny to bless himself   love rarely crosses the great divide of social class   so  you see  laura   that declaration you signed before sir timothy   it means that you and i are the guardians of secrets  that even he may not know of     it's certainly less      maybe under some lace   i do think that  this would suit your ladyship   the style is the new favourite of princess louise   i don't think so   perhaps the green satin does so suit your ladyship's comely complexion   could i have a reel of blue cotton for miss lane   ruby  would you   yes  now i know green is not always your colour   but this one is a very special blue    it absolutely pinpoints your eyes       aren't you the child from lark rise    yes  ma'am   well  make sure you don't touch anything in my shop  will you   you wonder that miss lane could not find someone more genteel  than a little country girl to assist her in her office   i can read  and i can count  and i was brought up with proper manners   which is more than can be said for some people in candleford   well    well   i can't see her lasting long under miss lane's standards   mrs arless     mrs arless  are you at home   sir  i'm looking for mrs arless   i've travelled over special from oxford to collect her payment for the beer   do you know where i might find mrs arless   alfie  has old monday paid you your wages   yes  sir  he has   have a thought before you hand it over to your ma   well  she'll be expecting something   there's a fair chance she'll spend it before the day's out   it won't be easy to refuse her but it might be the right thing     yes  sir    good lad   i am your ma   you give your wages to me     but you will buy food with it    i'll buy food   course i'll buy food   you see if i don't   so how's your new girl  laura  settling in   she's bright  spirited  more afraid than she likes to show   knows her own mind   i hear she made quite an impression with pearl and ruby pratt   yes  and for that you should give her a medal and i should raise her allowance   timothy  you are looking at me in that disconcerting way of yours   am i   she just reminds me of you at that age   you are no good for me  timothy   you bring out the sentimental in me  and sentiment is as unattractive as self pity   i fear there's trouble brewing with lark rise   the letter to the post master general   oh  word is out i see   i have a suspicion robert timmins is behind it   i wish i could wave the charge but  he's in the wrong  they're in the wrong   they're outside of the limit and that's the end of it   if only life were so simple   my father would never back down   not when he felt there was an injustice against poor people   but i felt torn   i couldn't help falling in love with the luxuries of candleford   your bath is prepared  miss lane   then i shall take my canary dip  thank you  zillah   baths are my one weakness   a quart of buttermilk  i say   a quart of buttermilk she has to wash her face on churning day   and warm rainwater for the bath   poor queenie  her brother's ill   you'd better fetch thomas   mrs turill   telegram   thomas brown says he ain't giving me the telegram  till he's got the three and six pence in his hand   no  i told them  i told that dorcas lane herself    i ain't paying  and that's a fact   i'm sorry  queenie  but wrong is wrong   if that's got our name on it  then it's our telegram   ain't no candleford muster going to keep it from us   come on  lads   gentlemen there he is     thomas brown  that's our telegram      thomas brown     give us our telegram     come back  come here    i'm not standing for it   there'll be trouble about this telegrams   won't have to be no trouble if them up the road do what's fair and right   it's the post office regulations  robert  it's not candleford's doing     even if that's what you want it to be   robert     it was you who wrote the letter to the post master  about the telegrams  wasn't it   i give them a few tips on the wording of it     oh  robert    it ain't my name on it     i made sure of that    it'll stir trouble  and you know it   you couldn't leave it alone  could you   it's the same man  the same horse  the same cart  delivers telegrams to candleford  do they have to pay for it   if you get yourself involved in this   you'll not make it easy for laura at the post office   if anyone's petty minded enough to use it     oh  listen to yourself  you think this is about your principles  and the rights and wrongs of the telegrams  and the distance  but it's not   you just need something to throw your sadness at   is that right  you know that  do you  you know my emotions  my    motives i better than do myself    yes  i do     when it's about your daughter    well  you're wrong   you think i haven't turned my guts inside out asking myself that   it's unfair  i just want poor people to get a bit of justice   i'm asking you  please leave it alone   will you promise me that   thomas was unable to deliver it  i'm afraid     but it's for queenie    yes   well  her brother's ill  she should be told   why didn't he tell her   oh  because  laura  it isn't as simple as that   the post office is built on rules and regulations   can rules and regulations be wrong sometimes   and it is founded on these principles for very good and honourable reasons   you'll appreciate that when you're older  and more experienced in the proportion of things   i don't believe i will  miss lane   i don't think i'll ever appreciate what's cruel and heartless   laura  that is enough   your place is to work and not to question what you don't  properly understand  and that's exactly what you will do now   suppose i don't get the three and six   does that mean we never find out what's in the telegram   well  that don't seem right   suppose it is something pressing   perhaps we could ask miss lane  if the post office will tell us who it's from at least   that might only add to the mystery of it   suppose it's from someone you don't like   or someone who don't like you   or someone you don't even know   well  i don't like the things   edmund  ethel     now  go on    where are you   steak and onions   oh  caroline    how can you afford steak and onions   alf has his wages  and i ain't going to squander it paying my debts   but it's all gone on one meal   oh  i shall feather the foam   i have before and i shall again   come and sit down  emma  have yourself a bite   whoever said no to red meat   you haven't paid your rent  haven't you  caroline   life's for enjoying   what's the use of worrying  i say   timothy  i thought we might ride out ingleston way  what do you think   well  to be quite frank  dorcas  we always ride out  in whichever direction you to take a fancy for   how can you say such a thing  it's as much as i can do to keep up with you   what is it   mrs turrill's brother   we had a telegram yesterday to say he was ill   thomas was unable to deliver it because  queenie couldn't afford to pay the three and six pence   now it seems he has passed away   poor woman must have lain awake all night   wondering what it was we were keeping from her   dorcas you were only the messenger  don't punish yourself too much   my father always impressed upon me to put aside my feelings  and do everything according to post office regulations   but it doesn't come easily when it means  i have to stand by something i don't believe in   well  perhaps you and i could i ride over to lark rise now  you could  deliver the news to mrs turrill yourself  offer her your apologies   i'm sure she would appreciate that   and i hear she was unmannerly  to miss pearl and miss ruby on her first visit to the stores   you have to wonder what miss lane was thinking of  bringing such a girl  under her roof   rain in the sky again     i'd better have just one more tart to see me through the second delivery   i felt i did not have a friend in candleford   and don't you make the mistake of thinking  i'm here at the beck and call of just anyone  my girl   cos i ain't having it   and after the troubles with the telegram about queenie's brother   i felt i didn't want one   we're all sorry at the post office     sorry that you didn't receive the message   if i have added to you suffering     he was such a beautiful boy   my mother always said    harry will even look handsome in his coffin    mrs turrill  if there is anything i can do   such a beautiful boy   dorcas  is something the matter   i just called on mrs turrill  because we had a telegram to say that her brother had been taken ill  but  unfortunately  thomas wasn't able to deliver it   and now the poor man has died   i thought perhaps i should tell her myself   that's very considerate of you   but if queenie had known he was ill  she might've gone to be with him   thomas should have told mrs turrill that she could come in to the post office    to collect her message    yes   if she'd walked the distance she'd know it wasn't eight miles     i would hope that you know me      it shouldn't be at candleford's favour  that queenie finds out if her brother's living or not   folk in candleford don't pay three and six  do they     but they don't live outside      it isn't eight mile   ladies  if i might suggest there does seem to be  a fair and simple way to resolve the dispute about the distance   erm  we'll measure it   and i'll oversee the operation to guarantee impartiality   that might be a fitting way to put this thing to rest   how does next sunday sound   measuring    yes  to settle a dispute  i had to do something  it was my idea   you're measuring the distance between candleford and lark rise   and that is why we will miss the most stunning ball of the summer    adelaide  i am the squire   i'm sorry  but i must attend to this  this as what i do   but so far as i can see  this is a post office dispute   which doesn't really call for  the squire  to resolve it   yes  i suppose it is a post office matter  but these are my tenants   so it is my duty to see justice done  you can see that  can't you   adelaide  the more i give myself to my obligation  the more i enjoy it   you could join me   we could do this together   thomas  i think that perhaps on this one sunday you might show a little pliancy   you may call it pliancy  ma'am  the lord calls it dereliction   and the dereliction leads to degradation   keep holy the sabbath day   we will have two penny stamps   we just wanted you to let you know  miss lane   that we will be there to stand behind you come sunday   i'm not sure that will be necessary  ladies   but it's our duty to defend the town's good name   it's a wonder you allowed such a challenge  to your authority and integrity   to the integrity of all of us   it is a slight on the standards of the whole of candleford     we mustn't let this blow up into      we will be there     we have encouraged our friends and customers to come to the cause   we will ensure that the whole of candleford stands behind you  miss lane   pa     what are you doing here    enjoying the sights   my  don't you look the part   how is it for you here  laura   i like having my own room  and the meals and the baths  and there's books everywhere   you would tell me if you couldn't settle here  wouldn't you     of course  i would    well  it's all for the best     here's to you in your new home    what is it  pa   i've walked that road i a thousand times  why is it today it seems further than eight miles   i feel as if i'm making a fool of myself  laura   i said i knew things i didn't know   made others believe me  and now just don't know   we'll all be fools  all of lark rise   now  don't you worry though   if i'm wrong it might dent my pride  but that's not what matters   there's a chance we're right  and we must take it   so that what happened to queenie never happens again   hopefully they'll be there next week   laura   i have some clothes from when i was your age   i thought you might like to have them to wear in the post office   i don't think i'll be needing them  ma'am   do you feel that candleford is not right for you   i feel as though i am not right for candleford  i know it can be difficult to settle into a new home  a new town   but i must admit i thought you were doing rather well   and there must be some things about candleford that you quite like   so what is it that's really troubling you   i saw my pa today   he walked back from lark rise   and he is convinced that the hamlet is outside the eight mile limit     that the measuring will certainly prove lark rise to be wrong   perhaps that is just his fear talking   or perhaps your father is right  laura     i know i had no right to be so cross with you  ma'am   but i just wanted to explain that the cost of a telegram    is such a great burden to poor people    do you imagine i don't know that   if respect the post office rules   it doesn't always mean that i like them   don't be despondent   my father used to say that we should work with the regulations   but i have always rather enjoyed looking for ways to work around them     are we ready  matthew    sir   then lead on   william   so as the church bells rang that sunday morning   we set off to walk to lark rise   i was heading homewards but somehow  i found myself on the wrong side of this little war   thomas  did the lord give you the day off after all    it's not like this is work though  is it  ma'am   no one can say that thomas brown did labour upon the sabbath day   timothy     i'd like to thank you for doing this whatever the outcome   i'm just doing what's right by my tenants   yes  but you have been a constant friend to me  and i cannot let that go unmentioned today   sir timothy   perhaps we could stop for something to eat now   food is my one weakness   matthew  a luncheon break  i think   luncheon break   adelaide  what a wonderful surprise  come and have some lunch   your ladyship  you've joined us just in time for the conclusion of our odyssey   forgive me for arriving so late   i imagined that you could get along just fine without a  city  girl   matthew  can you predict the result   i'd say by the time we get to lark rise     we'll be outside the eight mile limit   what's dorcas saying to matthew   right  time to bend the rules   laura  i need you to take a message to your father   what have they been feeding you in candleford   i have so much to tell you  i don't know where to begin   you might begin by sitting down beside me   i can't  i have to talk to miss lane  i'll find you later   excuse me  sir  if i might ask   which way are you proposing to travel   only that isn't the most direct way  sir   the road i always travel is the main route   i think you'll find post office regulations  say nothing about the main route   or the safest  or most convenient   just the distance from the post office must be no more than eight miles     you can't do this    what are you proposing  mr timmins   we go round the rise that way and into the hamlet there   matthew  lead on  mr timmins will show you the way   william   ma'am   it's still gonna be close   well     there are only a few yards in it  but a result is a result   ladies and gentleman  i believe that we have established today   that according to post office statutes   the village of lark rise lies within   i repeat  within    the eight mile limit and   therefore is not subject to charge for the delivery of telegrams   but i won't be delivering across no field   how can they say that's right   i think the lord would want us to be magnanimous in defeat  thomas   well  i think the squire could stand a beer for those with a thirst    after our seven mile walk    what did i tell you   ain't no use in worrying  you see  things always turn out somehow   you keep your brother close  young laura   brothers can get lost if you don't keep a careful eye on them   be warned   one for the fiddler   miss lane   erm  i hope you'llagree  ma'am   that what's been paid out  should be returned   right is right  mr paxton   which is why i have already returned the three and sixpence to mrs arless   mrs arless    mrs    no  no  hold hard there  mrs arless   mrs     and anyone else who has paid  if you will give your telegram to thomas   i'll make sure that you're reimbursed   that still ain't right  candleford still come out on top   don't you dare start anything more   they've got our laura and i just want to tell them how lucky they are   but perhaps not today  eh     twister turrill is my name     england is my nation      lark rise is my dwelling place     and christ is my salvation      when i am dead and in my grave     and all my bones are rotten      sing you this song and think of me     and mind i'm not forgotten       miss lane  i was wanting to say      i know  laura   post office regulations have their advantages  too  hm   miss lane was certainly right about that   life was infinitely more complicated than i'd thought   the little war of the telegram had given me a glimpse of her love of mischief   sir timothy had called her  an i excellent woman   and i was about to find out  just what he meant   i felt so proud of my friends in lark rise  poor beyond imagining   yet they had never lost the secret of being happy on little
