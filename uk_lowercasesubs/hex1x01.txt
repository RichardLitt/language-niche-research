help us to understand the future   it teaches you that whatever you do with your life        in a hundred years time no one will give a toss   this whole state was built in this matron        and now three hundred years later        everyone has forgotten   who was she   rachel mcbean  se was the first mistress of the state   and not a very nice lady  by all accounts  what happened to her   she became fascinated with the religion of the african servants   now a days we call it woo do  right  nothing evident   all religion is dangerous cassie  if taken too far   about presuming rachel death   locals thought se was a witch   then a young maid went visiting the house and her body was found in the lake   she murdered her   i don t know if murder is the right word   sacrificed   story goes that she was trying to summon someone or something   but we mustn t be too quick to judge   the heart of our own religion is a sacrifice  a very brutal sacrifice   and what happened to rachel   the lovely rachel went insane   her husband expend most of his fortune trying to cure her   he stayed with her   to the bitter end   knight   some times love is a sacrifice too     hi   hi  i can face me

spontaneous human combustion   can't think of anyone more suitable   are you happy here  cassie   boyfriend   not really   what  what am i teaching these boys   maybe is me  maybe i'm not that interested   still too busy talking about themselves  are they   well  if you didn't see anything     do you mind if i ask you something   no at all   who is azezeal   it's just something that i read and i didn't know want it meant   he was the leader of the nephelin     the what    the nephelin   t brood for the followed ones   right   if memory serves    they were angels who fell in love with mortal women     according to the ancient text  there were two hundred of them      and they taught women the power of witchcraft   that explains a few things   now  listen to this      and the whole earth has been corrupted through the works that were taught by azazeal   to him ascribe all sin   so  what happened to them   god  not at his most merciful  held them into the abyss        where they remain ever since   what if they haven't   i think there's something in here about them    feasting on the soiled men     but i wouldn't bid anything over it   do you think the nephelin really exist   absolutely   most of them were near eleven   so  ah    we can watch a movie        play scramble        find a man with an extra large hose        just in case somebody else decides to expontaneously burns into flames     the one who's toxic is leon     you really don't like him much  do you   what's that supposed to mean   it was you  wasn't it   you said you couldn t control it    whatever you

me     thelma  well  it's true   you think you can do what you like with me   because you know how i feel about you   and i feel the same about you   i know you do   well    maybe not quite in the same way   i don't believe that   all those things that you said  why did you said it if you don't mean it     what things    about giving up blocks   we were having a laugh   you were   please  don't get like this   you flirt with me   you know that   you    play with me because you enjoy feeling you got some sort of power of me   because you think i'm some sort of looser   more of a looser than you are  that makes you feel better by yourself     no    but the real truth        it's you can't admit your feelings for me   we both know what i'm talking about   the difference is you can't deal with it   we're best friends   we always will be   you don't get it  do you   thelma   thelma  listen  wait     so    you left the party with thelma    yes   and you returned to the school together   no  we split up   and when you get back was she there   no  i waited up for her   so  you were worried about her   no  well  yeah  a bit   where did you last see her   in the high street   and do you remember at what time you left the party   but you were the last one to see her   probably    i don't know   did something happen between you cassie   it was stupid   you had a brawl   not a brawl   what was it about   nothing   was it about your friendship   yeah   it's ok  cassie   what's ok   i    i know you are very good friends   yeah   and    well    you're very close   oh  please  this is the lesbian bit   well  i've never really asked you about your relationship   we're best mates  that's all   did thelma want something more   yeah   it's not your fault cassie  and        i'm sure this will sort itself out   is there anything else you can remember about last night cassie   anything at all   do you think someone else might have seen her   it's important cassie   no  we don t care if she is away with the fairies        just as long as we know she is safe   she left by herself  i'm sure of it   cassie     cassie     where is thelma   are you always going to be this difficult     look i    i don't know who you are    please cassie   don't insult my intelligence   azazeal   thank you   what do you want from me   i thought we could get to know each other   i kind of formed an opinion and let's say is not favourable   that's a shame   why have you been following me   i'm weak cassie   i need to regain my strength   and you are going to help me     i don't think so    do we have to pretend that you have a choice   yes   fine   what's that supposed to mean   it wasn't an accident that you found the cannery  nothing is   you must admit    is living things up for you a bit   you enjoy your new powers   they make you feel better about yourself   they're just a taste for things to come   i know what happened to rachel     nothing she didn't want    really   she gave me bodily form  i gave her bodily bliss   you drove her mad   rachel was her own undoing   i want to see thelma   don't piss me about   you want something from me  then do something for me   i need to see thelma   ok   thelma   cassie   what do you want from us   i told you  rachel sacrifice was a long time ago   and   i'm loosing strength every day   it's the only way   you don't understand yet   sacrifice must be willing   must be sacrifice in the true sense of the word   and it will be willing in one way or the other   because you know the alternative   she's done nothing   so   leave her   you like her that much   yes   i thought so   stop this   you don't get it  do you   what   love is a sacrifice too  remember   not her   i know   you'll give yourself for her   yes   so it must be love   cassie  noooo   i told you i needed a willing sacrifice   excuse me   nooo   nooooo      invite us to be your servants        so that one day we may rule with him        and share at his heaven   show your mercy lord        and through your love allow this dearly departed soul        to join the angelic rows   in the name of the father  and of the son  and of the holy ghost  amen   if i could say a few words     thelma was everything        the students of madisen school should aspire to   you cannot help but        admire her utter determination to be herself   and yet perhaps  it was this        her resulting sorrow        for which we must all bear some responsibility   it was the real cause of her death   whatever led her down to the lake that night we shall never know     but let us join together to pray that her soul rest in peace   that bloody loving this   don't be a dyke or will end topping yourself   let us all bow our heads for a moments  and remember the thelma we knew   she may looks dumb but she's a pussycat in bed
