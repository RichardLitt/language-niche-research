his car there   that's why we were at the hospital  they changed the meeting   it's six o'clock  a different address  i've got it in my pocket   take it out   the other    pocket   why should i believe you  it's the truth  it's like i said to the guy in the hospital   who i thought was you before he turned out not to be you   if there was any way i could save your wife  i would   suppose i believe you       and that this meeting is for real   i'm not gonna go there without any money   no  i wouldn't do that  makes sense   only a total idiot would go there without any money   yeah  we were actually saying that at the hospital before   which is why i'm sending you   what  you're joking  right   those winks mean you're joking  right   that was a joke  that was a funny joke   when you do a wink  it means it's a joke  right   i think we established quite clearly that we just work for the council     nibblin' on my sponge cake    watching the sun bake    all of those tourists covered in oil       i think that's long enough   i don't understand  this was definitely the meeting place   i swear  please believe me   we've been waiting here for an hour and no one's here   you've got to understand how this looks   i track you leaving the home of one of russia's most wanted   with close to a million pounds   and     when i politely ask you to stop       you run  and keep running   i mean  at best it's rude   and then  when we do finally get to have a little chat   you tell me that you've been talking to a man on a phone   a phone which doesn't seem to exist   so     how about we stop with the fairy tales and start with the truth   ok   right   you  take this   combination is on there   you  get out   what  why   get out   ah  don't    please don't hurt him  oh  my god   just
