 ever wanted to be the imaginary friend of an idiot boy  in the west of ireland   me neither  but there you go   allow me to introduce  martin paul kenny dalglish moone   martin moone was a simple child   the sort of tender boy who'd care for a poor injured chaffinch   or indeed a deceased chaffinch  thinking it was injured   you'll be back on your feet  in no time  missus magpie   her breathing is becoming faint   right  you know what to do  buddy  don't be shy   but according to school bullies  the bonner brothers     martin was just a simpleton who kissed dead birds   moone's shifting a dead bird  you're such a gay   no  lads  that's not shifting  there was no tongue there   it's medical shifting   ow   stop hitting yourself  stop hitting yourself   i'm just a boy  game

door   it just    came out of nowhere  it's wrecked  martin   how many times did you cycle in to the door   there were two doors  which doors  where   what really happened  martin   this isn't the first time you've banged into things   do you remember you said you fell into a tree   that's not even possible is it   well  to be honest the bike fell apart pretty easily   there were no structural problems with that bike  martin moone   was it those bonner boys again  they've been giving him  a hard time at school   right  where you going   nobody bullies my boy   except maybe sinead   you

don't know what to do with them anymore   i mean  you probably came over here  expecting me to be some horrible angry brute  who bullies his kids who in turn go out and bully other kids   am i right   well  kinda  yeah  but i'm not   i'm a good person   you seem like a good person  thank you   you seem like a good person too   thank you   god  i hate my kids   i'm not too crazy about my own

didn't kill them   not a chance   no  i think you're out on your own with this one  buddy   you know what you need   a bully protector  a rabid dog    or a bully protector   there was only one man for the job   declan mannion  feared and respected in equal measure   he was a bully's bully  and brought a degree of class and innovation  to the whole bullying game   he invented the cambodian burn   similar to the chinese burn  ow   but with his own unique twist   that's my john hancock  sucker   wait  he added an element of witchcraft to the wet willy   why is my other ear wet  you've been hydronated  hombre   sure  he'd take your lunch money every monday   but he'd use that cash to bet on greyhounds   come on  you one eared bitch   and if he won  he'd return the funds without interest every friday   here you go  padraic  have a nice weekend   authoritative but respectful tone   mr mannion  could i have a word   what's troubling you  moon face   well  i'm having a little bother with the bonner brothers   protection's a service i provide   it's gonna cost you though   cost me what  roughly   a feel of your sister's boobs   i'm sorry  what was that   a feel of your sister's boobs   should have gone with rabid dog   take it or leave it  marty   seems fair   we have ourselves a deal  sir   leave me now  hounds won't pick 'emselves   one more thing  which sister   whichever one has boobs  you tit   martin had never paid much attention to his sisters' boobs before   but on weighing up their assets he cluelessly deciphered that  trisha  his most violent sister  was best suited to declan's needs   with the dirty declan deal in place  martin approached his sister  with his favourite bribing beverage  hey trish  made you a cuppa  tea   wow  that's a cool     whatever it is   anyhoo  i was wondering if you might do me a wee favour     probably not  what do you want   well  silly thing  you know the way you have boobs      put padraic's lunch money on patooties to win   codology in second  and nickelback third  oh  that does not look good   oh  is that your banjo  what  it's such a fun instrument   i've always wanted to have a go  not now  sean   i want to hear what trisha says  who do you think you are   perv  asking to feel   guess what    the only part of you'll ever feel  is my foot kicking you up the   got that  you little   alright  go on  sort that shit out   sorry about that  take two   so  let's talk about my sister sinead instead   what are your general feelings about back acne   i think i'm in l     oh  sorry  my mistake  he loves her   sinead  please   what  liam  you sound tense   oh  gerry  sorry  no  it's just     kids  yeah   listen  i was just thinking that you might like to pop along to our poker group   you free tonight  tonight  it's a bit short notice   wasn't me   i'll be there in an hour   would she like that  no  i don't think she's into teddies   that  i think she's ok on staplers  that   soup  everyone likes soup   yeah  i suppose     great  give me your money  i don't have any money   but martin knew that a little more romance might be required  to win trisha over     your fire burns bright  like the sun   which is incredibly hot  like a fire  which burns bright like the sun   mmm  that's beautiful   that's beautiful martin   maybe you could ruminate on her appearance a little more   read back what you've got   i love your mousy hair   like a beautiful mouse   and your pale blemished skin  and your scent   you smell even nicer than     crisps  crisps   i smell like crisps  nicer than crisps   is declan in the special class   and he got you this as well   soup  the thinking man's tea   oh wait  is this     a piss take of love letters and stuff   is he trying to be ironic or something   yeah  obviously   huh  that's kinda funny   i suppose     i mean  don't get me wrong  i love being a father but  i've given so much of myself   that i don't even recognise the parts that are left  you know   like what liam was saying about the window in his workshop   you can fix it  but who fixes you  right  exactly   and they're so fecking dirty   my declan washes his feet in the toilet   just because he can  little bastard   well  lads  i've got to say  that this little gathering has been very     cathartic  but i have to admit something here   i don't know how to say this  but     go on  liam  be dad  not sad   i don't actually know how to play poker   worry not  liam   none of us do   but i thought this was     i think you know what this is   i don't even own a deck of cards   oh  jeez   well
