in britain the grain harvest has been gathered over recent weeks   and once again  it is our good fortune  to make thanksgiving for a bountiful crop   helpers have come forward to assist in bringing the harvest home   in addition  there's been the work of italian prisoners   or perhaps i should say   collaborators    but there will be need of other volunteer hands to make a 100  job of it   what about you    bea  are you ok     i'm fine    no  you're not  look at you  you're shaking   i think it was the rabbit stew   well  no one else got sick   maybe you should rest today  i could ask lady hoxley   no  she's already looking for an excuse to send us home   anyway  there's no need  i can work     don't be silly    i just needed to be sick   really  i feel much better now  come on   no one else was there  i couldn't resist     oh  and which room was this    the ballroom   right  so i can see myself in the big  long mirror opposite   and i've got the drapes wrapped around me like an exotic velvet ball gown   i start imagining that i'm scarlett o'hara   is that from john   you know  remember the dance scene   i'm swishing about to the music in my head   then suddenly  i hear a voice next to me      what on earth do you think you're doing     lady hoxley   how long had she been standing there   long enough     how is he    homesick   have you heard from harry yet   i would've died on the spot   what did you say to her   well  what could i say    well   i appear to have wandered into a fantasy of my own creation    late last night  the condover airfield was hit in a bombing raid   that's less than 20 miles away   this was a properly camouflaged airfield   how did the germans know to target it   they got my telegram  then   someone is tipping off the enemy   make no mistake  these are dangerous times   if you think you see anyone suspicious  i want you to report it directly to me   and who do we report him to   be vigilant   the enemy could be closer than you think     dismissed   where are you going   egg duty     jammy    have fun  girls   esther      a word  please   you're not going to work in that  are you  you'll die of heatstroke   i'm just a

you well   that  my lad  is carrot whiskey     carrot whiskey    lesson number one   if you find yourself with too many carrots  and not enough gobs to chew 'em  don't waste 'em  ferment 'em   not just a hat stand  i think you'll find   i've been waiting two weeks for this   it could probably do with a bit longer but  er     i'm not a patient man   the moment of truth     that'll put hairs on your chest    yeah   you've got to grow 'em first   now  i've got two full buckets in the barn   i think i can flog 'em  but we're gonna need some bottles   flog it   who's gonna buy carrot whiskey   bea    bea  there's easier work you can do  you know   are you gonna help me  or what   bea  slow down   no     what's got in to you today    nothing   can you just leave me alone   what's going on  bea   has something happened   look  talk to me     i can't  you'll hate me    i could never hate you   i'm pregnant   what    how can you be   did somebody force you     it was that gi from the dance    him    but when  you can't possibly have seen him after      you're starting to show already  it happened that night  didn't it   you'd only known him five minutes  and you let him sweet talk you into going off alone   what did you think was gonna happen  you stupid girl   i'm sorry  annie  i'm so sorry   please  you have to help me   well  of course i'll help you   i mean  i've tried lifting heavy things but nothing works   you have to help me get rid of it  annie   i heard you took a fall   that's not like you   are you all right   it was nothing   haven't you called benedict     no    why on earth not   because i know what i'm doing   don't be ridiculous  you need a vet   please  don't call him   ellen  the man's a butcher   how can you even think of doing such a thing     i've got no choice    no  i won't let you   when they find out  they'll send me home  dad'll kill me   that is an innocent child  you've no right to end its life   what about my life   don't take it out on me just cos you can't have a baby     bea     bea  i'm sorry      i'm afraid it's not good news   there's a severe fracture to the cannon bone  worst place   there's nothing we can do   it's a shame  he was a handsome horse     wait a minute    thank you  benedict     would you mind dealing with it    of course   wait a minute  don't i get a say in this   if we can take the weight off his leg   surely there's a chance it'll heal   and how  pray tell  do you propose to do that   by suspending him  in a sling   i've seen it done  in the great war  a general's horse broke its leg in the same place  and they suspended it to few weeks  and then it made a full recovery   no doubt the general's horse was young and fighting fit   i admit  caeser is a year or two older  but he's in peak condition   to keep such a horse inactive and in pain would be inhumane   and impractical   where were you thinking of dangling him from  lawrence   a tree  a bridge perhaps   no  i'm sorry  it's very unfortunate  but caesar simply has to go     you should shoot me along with it    what   i said  perhaps you should shoot me along with it   i've got a bad leg  i'm getting on   i'm sorry  but i'd like you to go   now  please   you can't be serious about this   nancy     watch yourself   you haven't seen bea  have you   not since earlier   have you had a row or something   well  yes  but it's nothing serious   it's just bea being impossible  you know   not just a hat stand  i think you'll find   good lad  you're learning fast   sort through them  see if any of 'em fit   lesson number two   you never know when you might need a cork   hello  there   what's happened to you  then   you need a hand  sir     lawrence  please    yes  sir   thank you   just  er    that's it  just in here   what's it for     you wouldn't believe me if i told you    try me   bea   that's   it   how    how big is the horse   yes  you're right   it needs to be a little higher  doesn't it   well  maybe if we    no     sir  could we just use       just a second  i need to concentrate   if    if we built a scaffold     then maybe    no  see  that'll just take too much time   no  but if we use     what we need to do     is find something on the farm that we can use     somehow   we've got the scaffold with the winch in it for cleaning the well   so if we could extend the legs   then maybe we could make a  sort of  hammock and suspend him     what do you do in peacetime  joyce    oh  i'm a hairdresser   she's up there   billy  i'd rather you didn't     i just want to see her    please  i'd like to talk to her alone   and we have     fish paste  anyone for fish paste   and this one is    what do you know  fish paste   you  no talking   esther   what are you doing out here   i    i i i just wanted to bring this   it's such a hot day  i don't want no one getting dehydrated     thanks  yeah    i'll see to it   there you are    that's it     do you think i've hurt the baby   i hope not   annie  what have i done   bea   bea  look at me  look at me   i've been so stupid  i'm sorry   no     what i said about you      it doesn't matter any more   what's important is what we do now   this gi of yours  what's his name   why  what are you gonna do   i just want to talk to him     it's no use  i've tried    what   i've been to the barracks  he won't see me   the cheek   right  well  i'll make him see me  even if i have to chain myself to them gates   stand up  stand up  yes  you   i'm talking to you   you like laughing   what were you laughing about before   with the english woman   answer me   what's he saying     speak english    he speak no english  only italian   niente     damn    do you want me to take a look  sir   no  no  it's all right  thank you  i think i've got it   do you mind my asking     well  why you're going to all this trouble   don't you think he's worth it   no  of course i do  it's just  well  people like you don't normally     don't normally get their hands splintered     yeah  no offence    none taken   my father kept horses   when i was 15  i helped him birth a colt   as a reward  it was given to me   he was so handsome   headstrong   but more than anything  he was special because he was mine  my first horse   you never forget the freedom of riding your first horse  never   you know  we are going to have to do more to support this   what happened to him   your first horse   the great war   in those days  the army could seize civilian horses to use in the cavalry   when they came for him  i tried to hide him   i foolishly thought that if they took the others  they'd spare this one   they found us  of course   i had to watch them lead him away   knowing that he was destined to charge into a hail of bullets   pointless   anyway  caesar rather reminds me of him   and i'll be damned if i'm going to let him go so easily   nancy speaks italian   you've heard her   she's too clever for that   but not clever enough because her secret's out   just a question of proving it   you tell     you'd better look at this then   were you planning on showing me   of course i was  look  she's a good girl   when is it a crime to speak italian   since they declared war on us   i knew it   i knew there was something about that girl that couldn't be trusted   thank you  esther   so  joyce  tell me  where are you from   i'm from coventry   really   i say  you weren't there when the      no  i was in birmingham visiting my husband   goodness   but my parents  they were both in the house when the     well  it's gone now

well  he's all i've got   perhaps god will take that into account   i don't know how you cope   work hard  you laugh when you can and     don't dwell on things you can't change   annie     where you

 up   he's off the ground  he's off the ground   we've done it   we've done it   do you even know what you're looking for   please  just stay out of my way   but this isn't right  it isn't right   be quiet   will you just promise me you won't accuse her of anything   not yet  you get that letter translated at least   of course i'll get it translated   in the meantime    i want you to watch her every move   and don't let her go to town   i don't want her talking to outsiders   how am i supposed to keep her here  she's not a prisoner   just do it  esther   if she's a sympathiser  she's a risk to us all   excuse me   excuse me   i'm looking for a gi by the name of carl gillespie   are you here on official business   well  no  but it's important i speak with him   i can handle a broad bein'

tell me what's going on with bea i'll find out for myself   i've told you  this isn't any of your concern   you're not the only one who cares about her   i know that  but i'd rather handle this on my own   handle what   it's the yank from the dance  isn't it   he's the reason bea's so upset   they won't tell me where he is   it's a rare english delicacy  takes years to ferment   better than warm beer   of course it is   in the savoy  they charge five shillings a glass   but for you gents  i'm willing to part with the whole bottle for four   you won't get a better price than that anywhere else

that's it  break it up  everybody out  that's enough   outside   he's using this grotesque contraption without the slightest thought for our concerns   but what can i do   lord hoxley doesn't want me anywhere near the beast   am i the only one who cares for this animal's welfare  something must be done   but if it's lord hoxley's horse     he doesn't own this property or anything on it   the decision is mine   now  are you going to do what you're paid for  or am i going to have to shoot the horse myself   is this how you represent your country   brawling with american servicemen in pubs   have you no self respect   the americans came here to help defend us   is this how you repay them   it won't happen again  can i go now   you will stand here until i've finished what i have to say   tucker   i respect what you do with the war effort and that   but i don't answer to you and i never will   now  if you'll excuse me   i see you've learnt your attitude from your father   he doesn't seem to think he has to answer to anyone either   not even the law   perhaps i should have him investigated   black market trading is a serious offence     what are you doing    that's not your concern   wait  wait  does lord hoxley know you're here   i received instructions from lady hoxley  stand aside   no  i won't let you shoot that horse   i'm afraid you have no choice   no  please   lord hoxley  come quickly   i'd keep running if i was you   i think sergeant tucker's on to us   how do you mean   he suspects us for definite   well  suspecting ain't knowing   that's lesson number 4 by the way   rattling you hear that   that is the sound of the little man winning   remember that  you see   there's always a big man there ready to tell the little man what to do   you couldn't tidy around  could you  you made a right mess with that whisky     where'd you get hold of that    i found it in the barn   you used that for the whisky   i use that for me liquid fertiliser   you don't think    well  it wouldn't kill anybody   would it   no  course it wouldn't   would it  no  no  no   well  it might just make people a bit sick  but   there's no harm in that  is there   bea   what happened to you   i met cal   he hit you   well  it was an accident really  he was trying to get to billy   what was billy doing there   look  it's a long story   the important thing is that     cal knows   and      i'm sorry  bea   look  if it's any consolation you're better off without him   does that mean billy knows too   i hope you're proud of yourself   you scared the living daylights out of that poor man  he'll never set foot on this land again   good   oh  don't be absurd  lawrence   what about the farm   who's going to take care of the animals  you   well  why not   i know a lot more than you give me credit for   then you should know there's no room for sentimentality   but then that's you in a nutshell  isn't it   you'd rather prolong a poor animal's suffering than do the decent thing   you're a coward  lawrence   but we both know that  don't we   i should have known you weren't man enough for the job   he defended your honour   hello   billy   bea  where are those potatoes  they need boiling   i'll take them   nancy   can i talk to you a sec   me  sure   can we go for a walk  please   he wants you to spy on me     why    wouldn't say   look  i'm sure it's nothing to worry about   tucker's not been right in the head since the last war   he don't trust anyone   but i just thought you should know   yeah  thanks  billy   lord hoxley said that you helped him save his horse today   oh  i didn't do much  it was mostly him  really   that's not what he said   what did he say   he said he couldn't have done it without you   lawrence  lawrence   how could you   what are you doing here   you have no right to be here   either of you   sergeant tucker   hurry up   that's all of them  every last one     is he following us    no   liquorice   enjoy your walk     where've were you been    just in the fields  why   when i ask you to peel potatoes i don't expect you to run off   i didn't run off  i just went for a walk   well  in future i would appreciate being told   fine   i'll do the potatoes now if you want   it's too late  i've done them myself   i'm sorry   i know you were fond of that horse   it would have worked   keeping the weight off his leg  i'm sure     it would have worked   then why on earth did you shoot him  dear   seems you're an even worse coward than i thought   he had billy pummelling from the front  me kicking up the backside  and martin choking him from behind   he's only nine years old and fighting in pubs already  i suppose i should scold him   come on  who was it  who's been going through my things   what are you talking about   my books  my clothes  they've all been tampered with   well  is there anything missing   that's not the point  i want to know who's responsible   it was you  wasn't it   i'm
