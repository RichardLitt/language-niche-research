you   i miss you looking after me   you miss someone making your decisions for you   i miss you making my decisions for me   argh   i can't do this   um  if i don't get that research pack on my desk today   i'm the one who has to explain to mr reid tomorrow   it's me that's going to look bad   please don't let me down   i won't   you have received one new message   message received today at 11 09am   you want to play games with us   you want to play games   this is what happens when we play games   you show some respect   if you're talking to the police  she is dead   there's a change of plan  new address   so if you want to know where we're holding your wife   you pick up the phone   to hear the message again  press     all right   oh  my god   oh   oh  my god   oh  my god   dear god   that's not helping   they don't know who they're messing with   they don't have a clue who they're messing with   they want to mess with us   what are you talking about  they're not messing with us   they're not even messing with me  i'm the wrong man   they're trying to mess with the guy from the car crash   well  he's out of the game     this isn't a game    so why have i got my game face on   because that's what you're looking at  my game face   we need a plan of action  cos we sure as shit can't call the police   oh  they said they were gonna kill her if you call the police     it was before that    well  what did you say   nothing  i just left a message to call me back   good  from now on we just ignore them   this is ridiculous   you're looking at this the wrong way  this is our moment   we've been chosen   i'm a town planning and noise guidance advisor for berkshire county council   you're a 31 year old mail distribution assistant who lives with his mum   exactly  stuff like this never happens   i don't want it to happen  i haven't slept all night   i've got a load of work to do  lizzie will kill me    if i don't      oh  for god's sake   it's actually nothing to do with me   if this phone had rung three seconds later  i wouldn't even have heard it   you know what  i should just     no  no  no  no  no   stop  stop  stop   no  lock it up  lock it up  lock it up   lock it up   lock it up   and you know what  you're right   if that phone had rung three seconds later    but it didn't   it rung three seconds earlier  and there's a reason for that   someone out there needs us   a woman  a beautiful woman   now we have to save her   or there'll be blood on your hands   what do you think lizzie will make of that   there you are   what are you doing     nothing    just hanging out   trying to stay warm   right  there's a sergeant ince on the phone for you     returning your call   tell him i'm busy   he'll be in the hospital   we just need to find him  give him his phone back  end of story   right  but what if they call again  you can't ignore it   he was pretty clear about that     all right  well  we'll answer it  then    whoa   not  we   not  we   they must not know of my involvement   i don't want to know of your involvement   the greatest asset we have right now is they don't know that i'm involved   if they find out that i'm involved  they will shit themselves   i'm so glad you're the person i'm sharing this with  what are you doing down here   just popping over the road     going to get some sweets    do you want some haribo   you're not going anywhere until you've finished that research pack     i have    you've finished   yeah     well  it's not on my desk    i just need to print it out   great  come and do it now   ok   you know where i am     don't go without me    i won't     please    ok     promise    all right     there it is    oh   don't bother reading it now  just whenever     thank you  sam   um  sam     i'm sorry if i was    a bit harsh earlier   i still find those kinds of conversations a bit weird     me being your      my boss   that   it's fine  i just need to remember not to talk about us at work   so     well  hang on  i mean     maybe this is exactly what we should be doing  is talking about it   definitely  at some point     i see    what   you say you want to talk  but you always find a way of wriggling out   ok   let's talk now   good   well  first of all   i think you should know that i'm having a little get together   it's very casual  it's not a big     i'm sorry     you're not answering that    i have to   you are not    you are answering that  oh  my god   hello   picking up the phone  i see   i suppose you got the message   yes  i got the message   so  what can i do for you   you seem calm all of a sudden   i hope you're not planning something   no  no  not planning anything   i wouldn't be so calm if a knife was being held to my wife s throat   right  that makes sense   oh  you don't believe me  she'll tell you   no  no  i believe you   there's no need to     please  don't do    don't do that   stop it   silly billy     is it really so important      ssh

 he's my patient   i'm sam and my legs are fine   how did this happen  phil   i'll tell you how it happened   it happened because this country's going to hell in a handcart   and it's mistakes like this that give us a bad name   mrsa   i know  we're all tired   working too long for too little and we're fed up   but we cannot allow things like this to happen   this is making me very nervous   now  i know you're a good surgeon   i've seen your work  and i won't let you hang for this   the first rule of being in this room        is you don't talk about being in this room   agreed     yes    agreed   this is fight club   come on  sam  let's get out of here   coming   argh   i understand what you're saying  phil   i just don't see what i've got to thank you for     they were going to cut your leg off    yeah  because you left me unattended     and you fell asleep    you told me to close my eyes     we could go round like this for ever    wait   what   back up   that's him     are you sure    yeah  definitely   it says his name's mr smith  i thought you said he was called mr stevens   yeah  that's probably what they put when they can't    identify someone    like a john dory     you mean john doe    do i     yeah  because john dory's a fish dish    fish dish  sure   i think he might be in a coma   who are you   my name's sam pinkett   you don't know me  but i was there when you crashed your car this morning   it was me who called the ambulance   after you'd been taken to the hospital   your phone started ringing  and i picked it up   i know everything     i know that your wife is in danger    wh     i haven't involved the police   the kidnappers called again  and i agreed to meet them   i thought if i could just get your phone back to you   you could take it from here  but    i can see that's not     look  i don't know what to do   but if there's any way i can save your wife  i promise i will   i don't know what you're talking about   you had a car accident this morning   yeah   in a grey bmw     yeah    and this        is your phone   that's not my phone   that's my phone   i'm not even married   do you mind feeding me a couple of grapes   so whose phone was it  then   i guess we'll find out in 45 minutes   we can't just turn up empty handed  you said yourself  they're psycho   we've got no choice  we have to do something   but they're going to want hard cash  unmarked bills   sequential serial numbers  all that jazz   it doesn't matter  we're all she's got now   and whatever happened to  rolling deep    ok   i'm in   but you have got to stay focused at all times   because danger is everywhere   you know what danger doesn't do  call ahead   unless it's the ira   so are we gonna get the bus  or     where's my money   i don't know   don't fucking lie to me   your employer is a foolish man   well  i'm not gonna go there without any money     no  i wouldn't do that    that makes sense   foolish  cowardly man   only a total idiot
