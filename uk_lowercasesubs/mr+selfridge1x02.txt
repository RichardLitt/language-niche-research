we are in this together   the reckless way that you conduct your business frightens me   no love affairs if they want to keep their jobs   mr selfridge telephoned to say he wouldn't be in this evening   that's three nights this week   i'm ellen love  i'm the spirit of selfridges   i think you are a bit special  agnes towler   musker and i are so pleased with what you've done with our store   why thank you  lady mae  i think it's just wonderful  harry   ain't it just    all set  miss blenkinsop   yes  mr selfridge   all set  mr grove   all set  chief   all set  mr crabb   good morning   yes  mr selfridge   good morning  good morning  mr selfridge   ground floor  please   yes  sir   they're coming     good morning  morning    good morning  mr selfridge   something's missing   erm     customers   it is only five minutes past nine  mr selfridge   they should be battering down the doors   they should be swarming all over us   let's have some spot reductions on special lines for early birds only   nine am to midday  work something up for me  will you  yes  of course   good man  we need more sales  mr selfridge   one begets the other  we need to put on a show    mr grove  could i come and speak to you for five minutes later on   about   er    private matters  mr grove   you can come up at 11 00 if miss mardle will release you   of course   thank you  mr grove   back to work  miss towler   good morning  mr selfridge  good morning   morning  sir  good morning   i was hoping we could go over the figures this morning   not now  crabb  my staff expect to see me   people  not figures  are the difference  between success and failure   i thought profit had more to do with it   we're still not breaking even   we have a little problem  mr selfridge   hold your nerve  crabb   miss love  harry   look at these pictures they've taken of me   they're just terrible   i can't allow my public to see me like this   they're positively victorian   miss love  i see no problem with these photographs   they convey exactly the message i was asking for   then you must have got the message wrong   look at them  harry  they're dreary  really  aren't they   this can't be the spirit of selfridges   this is first class work  mr selfridge   but nothing we offer seems to strike her right   it's your decision   do them again and do them better  if miss love isn't satisfied   we're not satisfied   thank you  harry   you will come back and take me to lunch  won't you  of course i will   a bientot  a bientot   miss towler  follow me   thank you for seeing me  mr grove   so  i think you should tell me what this is all about   erm    well  it's about my brother  mr grove  my brother george   i was hoping you might be able to find a position for him   i see  and what has your brother to recommend him   well  he wouldn't want anything skilled  mr grove   but he's ever such a hard worker and eager to please   i just thought with mr selfridge hiring a lot of new staff   there might be something here for him   and what if i said i have nothing to offer him   well  i should be very disappointed  mr grove   and that's all   i don't understand  yes  i think you do   discretion is something we value at selfridges   i like to think that i can count on your discretion  miss towler   well  yes  of    of course   we all like to keep some things private   well  i think i might be able to offer your brother a porter's job  in the loading bay  subject to a satisfactory trial period   oh  mr grove  thank you  thank you so much   sorry  it's all right  miss towler   time to return to your post   let discretion be your watchword  yes  mr grove   oh  miss towler  yes  mr grove   i hope you haven't any more brothers at home wanting jobs   no  mr grove  thank you mr grove   hello  hello  fancy meeting you   what are you looking so happy about   mr grove's going to give george a job   huh  how did you persuade him to do that  then   did you have to give him a kiss  course not   if it was me  i'd have insisted on a kiss at least   good job you're not him  then   fraser  there you are  oh  apologies  ma'am   i didn't realise you were going out   lady loxley was rather insistent   lady loxley   call me lady mae  everyone else does   i've called at a bad time  i think  are you on your way out   i was  but it's nothing urgent   uh    fraser  would you ask mrs selfridge to join us   certainly  ma'am   a word with you  victor   do you know how you got this position   well  i am an experienced waiter  sir  good references   and   you're a very    attractive young man  victor   the ladies like that   that's going to be a great part of their pleasure in coming here   and not just the pretty ones  victor   the old ones  the fat ones  the neglected ones   the ones with husbands that can't satisfy them   we want them to come back again and again and to be made happy   i think i can do that  sir   i think you can   make sure those glasses are spotless   yes  mr perez   i just called to see how you were all settling in   i suppose you must be neglected with harry    with mr selfridge so busy at the store   oh  we're used to it  lady mae  and we don't feel neglected   and have you met miss love   the spirit of selfridges  as they call her   yes  at the opening  i thought she was quite charming   yes  yes she does charm people   men especially  one could say that's rather her thing   it's all terribly exciting  isn't it    this great new store and all the people who are drawn into it   so many exciting possibilities   new ideas  new friendships   perhaps i should go there more often   yes  perhaps you should   but perhaps you were about to go there as i arrived   actually  i was thinking of going to the national gallery   the national gallery   my dear  no one goes there on public days   it's full of all sorts of riff raff  but the paintings are the same   aren't they  whoever's there to look at them   what an original point of view   i'll get you a cab  mrs selfridge   no  please  let me give you a lift   my motorcar's just outside   oh  thank you  but i thought i'd try the underground   where to  love  trafalgar square   this is so sweet of you  i know how busy you are   well  you know  i'll always find time for you  ellen   thank you for this morning   perhaps i was wrong to make such a fuss   but the spirit of selfridges  should be something really special  shouldn't it  you've got it  ellen   that is my idea exactly  selfridges   modernity  the future   changing the way people see the world   the thing is  we have to find more and more new ways of saying that   but you are pleased with me   of course i'm pleased with you  very pleased with you   oh  that means so much to me  harry   because  you know  i'm still a little bit afraid of you   afraid of me  and why is that   you're so decisive  you're such a dynamo of energy   hmm  you don't care about danger   you just take a leap into the unknown  and devil take the consequences   in your own way  you're as much of a daredevil as that crazy frenchman  who's trying to fly the channel  say that again   you know  the one they're all talking about   blareo or    what i had in mind   i've got to go  what   mr perez  get frank edwards on the phone   i'm sorry  i've got to dash  i'll catch you later   not a word to anyone  it's all very hush hush   mr grove  i need you to get hold of the commissioner   tell him we need 12 bobbies standing guard    very good for publicity  mr crabb  call the insurance company  and tell them to increase liability by 10 000   it's very valuable   should i explain to them what it is we're insuring   no  not a word to anyone  any more questions  good   i'll be gone for the rest of the day  may i ask  what about the windows   think birds  henri   you know he's signed a deal with the daily mail   we'll get in on it  how well do you know northcliffe   we started out together  he and i go way back   long before he owned the mail  that's good   anyway  we're not stealing from him   we're helping him to double his circulation   if we get it right  he wins  we win  everybody wins   yes  of course  madam   was everything satisfactory  madam   yes  especially the service   thank you  madam   come here   this is for you   thank you  madam  you're too generous   may i know your name   victor  madam   victor   that's a lovely name   victor  i'm thinking of having a little party  tomorrow evening at 8 00   only a few friends  but it would be nice to have a first class waiter  to look after us   i wonder  do you ever do evening work like that   i am free tomorrow evening  madam   oh  good   here's my card with the address   and if you could come    just as you are   of course  madam   until then   it's wonderful  isn't it   one of the best things they have   what it must be to be able to paint like that   yes   and so unusual in a work of art   to see a man laid low by a woman   do i detect an american accent   yes  yes  you do   are you in london on holiday  doing europe  as they say   yes  yes  i am   we should    we should introduce ourselves   i'm roderick temple  i'm a painter   rosalie buckingham   er    look  i hope you don't mind   but erm    i was sketching you just now   why would you do that   you have this extraordinary quality of stillness about you  and i wanted to capture it   so you're a realist painter   no  no  more of a romantic  really   oh   this is probably going to sound quite pretentious   but my aim is to capture the inner beauty  and the the mystery of life through the human form   yes  that does sound pretentious  doesn't it  i'm sorry   no  no  not at all  not to me   do you paint yourself  years ago  before i was     um    when i was at college   look  i know this sounds quite cheeky  erm       but my studio's just the other side of charing cross road  and i'd love to show you some of my work  and see what you think of it   can i help you  sir  i don't know  my dear   there are those who say i'm beyond help   tell me  what do you think   i'm sure i don't know  well  i'll tell you what it is   i'm looking for something for my best girl for her birthday

such assignations   enjoy yourself  you're only young once   thanks  mr perez   make way  welcome   mr bleriot  a great achievement  welcome to england   the first man to fly the channel   who are you  monsieur  this is harry gordon selfridge   selfridges is the greatest store in london  and he's going to give you and your aeroplane pride of place in it   excuse me  monsieur  step aside   the people want to take photographs of me  not you   no  no  i understand  you think i'm trying to ride your coat tails   listen  give me five minutes  just five minutes   that's all i ask  if i don't convince you   i'll be out of your life forever   three minutes   these people don't know what they're looking at  but we do   this is the future  folk will be popping over the channel for lunch  without thinking anything of it  all because one man  had the courage and the daring to do it first   let me ask you something   what did it feel like to be up there in the clouds all alone   i thought i was going to die  monsieur  that is what i thought   how do you say    a squall blew up   the clouds came down and for ten minutes   i could see nothing   i was flying blind   flying blind  go on   it was strange   the wind was tossing me about like a leaf   but you know  i was quite calm   i was in the hands of fate  monsieur   and then the clouds cleared and i could see a place to land   and    here i am   that must have been one a hell of a feeling    totally lost in the empty space  flying blind   i know that feeling  i do   flying blind   we have a deal   no  i cannot work like this and i will not   monsieur leclair  always a pleasure  how are things going   it's over  i won't work with that man anymore   henri  what's the matter  simply  i've had enough   i come to you  you are chief of staff   i tender my resignation  i leave for paris this evening   henri  henri   ground floor  henri  please   henri   henri    henri  stop   tell me what happened  what happened   this morning  he humiliates me in front of his mistress  when he knows i am in the right  and now this exhibition i must build  just to make him look good  well  you know what   this time he has gone too far   let him see how he gets on without me   he's been rough on everyone today  you've simply had the worst of it   he shows no gratitude  no appreciation  but he does   you should hear the way he talks about you   he'll tell anyone you're a genius  and you are   he should tell it to me  i absolutely agree   he will  i know it  before the end of the day   no  he will not  because i will not be here  i will be gone   wait  henri  wait   wait until you've calmed down a little   sleep on it  would you do that   for me  because i'd hate to lose a brilliant colleague and friend   all right  for you  i will wait until tomorrow   now  you've got to pay attention  george   because i'm going to tell you about the special deliveries   is this a joke again   no  no  no  no  this one is deadly serious   mostly the goods go in the green vans   but every so often the blue van comes in for the specials   so if i say to you 'special delivery' or 'special'   you put it in the blue van   cos it'll be for urgent express delivery   probably for one of the directors or such like   and they like to keep it private   so we don't tell no one about the specials  understand   i'm trusting you now  george  i can trust you  can't i   yeah  you can trust me  alf   good boy  well  that's your first day done   see you tomorrow  eight o'clock sharp   carry on  ladies   oh  you gave me a fright   how's my best girl  then   busy  and i'm not your best girl  you know we're not supposed to     come on  i thought we might have a cup of tea together  when they let you go  no  not tonight   i've got to get home  what for   family business  private   all right  another night then  eh   maybe   oh  victor  you shouldn't have  they must have cost an awful lot   well  they would have if i'd paid for them   you stole them  perk of the job  you might say   shame you'll have to eat them on your own now   and next time i won't take no for an answer   night   ladies   ooh  agnes   i really think he's sweet on you   i wouldn't let him go if i were you   he's got lovely big brown eyes  and lovely long legs   bet he's got strong arms  too   give you a lovely squeeze  he could   come on  agnes  give us one of your chocs   truffles  my favourite   kitty  you've got such a cheek   calais   dover   selfridges  that's the headline   the bleriot aeroplane  which flew the channel yesterday   is on view  free of charge  on our ground floor   the public is invited to see this wonderful epoch making machine   we want it in all the papers  go to it   i was afraid we'd miss our tuesday night   what with the chief working us so late   that's good   i'm still worried about miss towler   i think we can trust her   strange little thing  isn't she   you'd think butter wouldn't melt in her mouth   but i reckon she knows the score  if she keeps her mouth shut   her brother has a nice little job in the loading bay   if it were to come out  we'd both lose our jobs   i keep thinking she'll follow you home one day and tell your wife   oh  my god  don't say that  she wouldn't do that   what could she possibly gain by that   anyway  let's not allow her to ruin our evening   this is about you and me  no one else   oh  roger  i do live for these precious hours together   my darling josie   be careful  this machine is worth a fortune   what a piece of junk  piece of junk   this is the work of genius   a french genius    displayed by our very own french genius   you are being very forthcoming with your compliments   i presume you have spoken to mr grove   i've come to say sorry  i have treated you abominably   yes  you did  and you will again  no doubt  if i stay   no one can spin straw into gold like you   you're the best  that's why i brought you with me from chicago   i know this  and you are the best at what you do   but one day you will push me too far   then you will be sorry   now  if you would please leave me to my work   there's nothing to worry about  george   he's not like he used to be and it's only for a few days   you said we'd never have to see him again   yes  well     here they are   the workers of the world   all right  dad   they make you work late at that place   well  we had to  there's this special exhibition coming off   i've got a few things in for you  so you can do our tea  aggie   your mrs payne was very accommodating   i think she took quite a fancy to me   people often do at first   georgie     georgie  got yourself a job   wonders will never cease  eh   how was it  son   all right  they said i was a strong lad   strong lad  is it   here we are  our little family  all together again   who is it   harry  oh  i didn't mean to disturb you   the day i've had    i tell you   i've got your crazy frenchman's flying machine at the store   do you fancy playing the aviatrix tomorrow   you know i'd do anything for you  harry   so does this mean you're taking me flying   we can't do it here now   someone might come in   i don't give a damn   oh

pathway to promotion  too  are you   i'm a good worker  i am   you're a joke  you're a snivelling little halfwit   you can't talk to me like that no more   oh  can't i   really   what are you going to
