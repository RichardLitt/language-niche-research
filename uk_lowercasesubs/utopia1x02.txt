weaponising anthrax  ebola  smallpox  on a massive scale   the west panicked and created an organization to combat the threat   it was known as the network   it was based in no country  reported to no one   and was utterly deniable   it did things democratic governments couldn't   they were insane  totally out of control   what's that got to do with us   basically  that's who's after you   you're

them   let me make this very clear   your lives as you knew them are over   what the next 48 hours are about is abandoning everything you knew  or thought you could rely on  and adjusting to the new reality   if you can adjust  you will live   if you can't  you will die   now  we need to change the way you look   we need to get very far away  and we need drugs for wilson   give me the gun   ian  hang on  c can we talk about this   mean  it's an armed robbery   it's adjust or die  ian   don't know what to think of her   you could have fooled me   oh  you've got to be fucking kidding me   what

real bee in their bonnet about the bloody vaccine   but they've named me   well  you did buy it  michael   and in any case  there's nothing we can do about it   we're tied into the contract   yeah  well    well  we're not  actually   i've found a cancellation clause   it can be enacted if the department's total spend  with the supplier is over 240 million   it's to ensure diversity of supply   yeah  but this is only 83 million  michael  mean  really  it's     no  no  but it's total spend   we get two other vaccines from corvadt   plus a wide range of antibiotics  cytotoxics  hypoglycaemics     mean  this puts us well over 240 mil   have the contracts sent over to me immediately  no one else to see them   look  whatever corvadt are paying you   we are not going to get away with it   we can stop all this   we can stop it all now   it's horrendous  trying to conceive  isn't it   the medical nature of it all  the ivf  all that science   a man needs warmth   so understand you fucking a prostitute   do   but what don't understand is you getting her pregnant   do you think your wife will understand   now  get the contract straight over to me now   it's for the best   ian and are going

walk into this   mean  how much did you know   because we had no idea  look at wilson's face   that's not my fault   tell that to his dad   because she doesn't have him  by the way   right  tell us the truth   all of it  not bits and pieces   all   or leave   would you like to at least sit down first  becky   no  jessica  fucking wouldn't  the network was created by two men   a geneticist called philip carvel  and someone called mr rabbit      mr rabbit    it's a code name  no one knows the real identity   when the cold war began to wind down   the various governments involved decided to back away   only thing was  mr rabbit and carvel had no intention of stopping   at some point  carvel wanted out   so they tortured him to keep him working and held his daughter hostage   eventually  his mind snapped and   he went mad   he was going be got rid of but somehow he was smuggled out   given a new name  and hidden in a psychiatric hospital   the hospital was shenley   and the new name was mark dane   what  you     you mean carvel wrote utopia   a therapist got him drawing   what he drew was        incredible   so all the things in utopia are real   like   bse  they created that   it's hard to say what's real and what's not  but  yeah        bse was theirs   how do you know all this   i'm philip carvel's daughter   was smuggled out with him when was four   i've been on the run ever since   did you pricks give me heroin   we had to  for the pain   oh   well  hope it wasn't afghan   taliban have been altering it for years to make us infertile   everyone knows that   sssh   we need
