'in the criminal justice system  the people are represented  by two separate  yet equally important  groups    the police  who investigate crime   and the crown prosecutors who prosecute the offenders   these are their stories '  hey  jess  hi   how's it going  good   try the soup   it's to die for   he means last time he made it  six people died   isn't that right  reverend   we've a bed at the shelter if you want it   you ok  mate    cheryl  call the ambulance   now   we're out here most nights  so most kids who   sleep rough  are familiar faces   but you'd never seen this kid before    no   ok  well  we'll need to talk to all the kids that were here earlier   reverend crawford   yeah  er   sorry   we do breakfast at the shelter for the rough sleepers   the kids usually enjoy that  too   that poor boy   he was dead by the time you found him  sir   there's nothing you could have done   one of our uniformed guys will look after you   multiple bruises and contusions   back of his head was popped like a grape   no wallet  no id  no mobile   so not a known local  what do you reckon  lad walked off the train  and got his first and last welcome to london  he was what   12  13   someone should tell these kids  the streets aren't lined with well wishers   if the street's the alternative   makes you wonder what they're running from   well  he didn't come out of euston station  must be a local after all   well  that narrows it down to  so how does a young kid like that get beaten to death  and no one notice  let's start with the witnesses   get down the reverend's shelter   someone from down there might have recognised the kid  yeah   mind you  state you're in now   they'll hose you down  give you a meal  you're no prince charming   first superdrug we pass  you're stopping for listerine   do you always smell so minty   cheryl  do you recognise him  love   i was too busy working last night trying to keep warm   go on  have a think  i bet nothing gets past you   do women ever fall for that   i don't know him from adam   cheryl  your tattoo   is that a local gang   yeah  i got out a few months ago when the rev got me this job here   since when did you become an expert on gangs   i'm old bill  not prehistoric bill   so where do you lot hang out   i'm telling you  man  i got an airtight alibi   we haven't told you when you need your alibi for yet   that's your world out there  this is ours in here  we don't mix   yeah  three pointer says you're wrong   ok   shame  man  you got a photo   he was found dead last night at the back of euston  head kicked in   don't need no photo  then  you know who did it   he weren't done by a gang  man   that whole area round there   that's the neutral zone   no one gets touched in the neutral zone   law of the land  man  youths gotta use the train  too  don't they   so bloody tribal  one street against the next   kids getting beaten for walking through outlawed areas   rivalry between kids ain't nothing new  matt   can't tell me you and your mates never organised a punch up  between your school and the next  we never carried knives or guns   then kids haven't changed  society has   i hate these cases  matt   all that potential gone   i'd say your male anon was 13   cracked ribs  punctured lung  a ruptured spleen   he hemorrhaged from almost every major organ   how long do you reckon he could have walked around like that   slow rate of seepage  an hour  two tops   any sign of sexual abuse  no evidence of any sexual activity   no fluids  no tearing of tissue  just normal blunt force wounds   probably from steel toe capped boots or dms   any tattoos  gang markings  no   somebody on the street must know this kid   there's no way he was living on the street   this boy was well looked after  well fed   his last meal was polenta and roasted vegetables   they don't serve polenta and roasted veg in soup kitchens   where are the parents in all this   if my kid had missing for the best part of a day   i'd be going spare  you and me both   we've sent his photo to all the other constabularies   just in case his parents do a walk in  there's been nothing   how's the response to the media appeal   lots of call  lots of sympathy  but so far no leads   and you've checked with missing persons  yep   no one matching his description  no match with fingerprints or dna   without his name  we've got nothing  nowhere to start   we just got a hit from the media appeal    a mrs lee  a teacher over in kilburn   couldn't believe it when i saw his face on the news   danny jackson   one of my after school regulars   hurry up  chloe   so i take it he wasn't exactly teacher's pet   actually  he was a decent kid  just shy   he had dyslexia and was on our mainstream scheme   do you have an address for danny  i've got an old one  six months ago   his mother moved  new boyfriend  according to danny   did he ever talk about his home life   you mean did he show up with bruises   kids are good at keeping that sort of stuff from you  yeah   baggy clothes'll hide a lot   yeah   the boyfriend's a bookie  wimbledon dog track   you're too late  danny's mum moved out three months ago   well  do you have an address   from day one  mandy and that kid of hers were nothing but trouble   everything ok  babe  nothing to worry about  sweetheart   i see you bounced right back   mandy left me  she ripped me off   as for danny  bloody hell  when he weren't drawing   he was bouncing off the walls   i reckon the reason mandy got stoned half the time was cos of him   what about you  stevie   you ever need to make danny see sense   i've never hit a kid   stevie   just give us mandy's address before she decides to move on again   she's in rehab   you see her   tell her i want my plasma back   that's her   she's been clean for nearly three months now   hello  mandy   social services said i wasn't fit to be left alone with him   so     i wanted him back  so i went into rehab   he cried when they took him away   i told him   danny  you're going to a nice house   you'll be fed and looked after and       safe    after everything i'd put him through   after   everything    he didn't wanna go   i want him back   please bring him back  i want him back   we'll get whoever did this   a few months ago   the pe teacher at danny's new school noticed some bruises   did danny say how he got them  too scared   child abuse team couldn't prove anything   i'd have had a fiver on boyfriend of the year  stevie agnew  myself   we took danny into care  two days later  mandy turns up   said she'd agree to do rehab  anything to get him back   this is what i always worried the inside of my head looked like   one person's mess is another person's filing system  thank you   was danny placed with foster parents  phoebe baxter   she's the best we've got   so why didn't she report danny missing on friday night   if i'd have told social services that danny was missing   they'd have taken him away from me  he was settling in so well   so well you didn't know where he was   it's not prison  i don't tag 'em   i've been doing this long enough to understand the pattern   they run away once   parents' house     hoping that mum and dad have patched up their differences   and after a day or two  they come back again   that's what i thought danny was up to   i failed him   so  just run us through what happened on friday evening  please   after school we all sat down and ate dinner together  like always   and then danny went off to the cinema with jono and andy   after the film  we stopped for some chips on the camden high street   so  tell us what happened then  jono   andy and i went in  got our order   when we came out  danny was just  like  gone   anything behind me  yeah  your youth   what about you  andy  danny say anything to you before he left   how was danny that night  andy   he's a right chatterbox  your mate  isn't he   he won't talk to the old bill  last time he did  he got nicked   we looked around for him  we thought he might come back here   so you think danny was homesick  andy   no way  that minger his mum was shaggin'    he used to hit danny for going in the back room  while he was watching ponies  danny told you stevie hit him   he showed us the bruises   i was in all night watching telly with debbie  danny never came round   i know people like you  stevie   people who lie about hitting kids   people who get a kick out of seeing the bruises the next day   i never hit him  i took him in  fed him   i put a roof over his head  why would i hit him   right now  soco are going through  all the cctv footage in your borough   uniform are searching your area   forensics are going through your flat  let me get this straight   you're saying i killed danny cos his mum nicked my telly   i never hit him  never   stevie   uniform       found this   it's danny's mobile phone   found it just across from your flat   i didn't kill that boy   look  guv  the other kids at phoebe baxter's    they confirmed that stevie hit danny   he's got motive  he's got previous  hang on  hang on   the kids said they only saw the bruises  not the beatings   nobody   nobody has proved that agnew was battering danny   and even if he was  it doesn't mean he's a murderer   look at his body language  he's sitting on his hands   it's classic  he's hiding something   what are you gonna charge him with   bad posture   one of you's right  but tick tock  boys   your custody clock is running down   ronnie  mate  i know it's him   matt  everything we've got is circumstantial  right   we have a phone that was found in a communal area   come on   listen  we have no witness   and agnew is gonna deny he's done anything wrong  until he is blue in the face   i've been that kid  you know   why don't we go and talk to debbie and check stevie's alibi   stevie usually takes me out on a friday night  but i had a stinking cold  so we stayed in   i sat on the sofa with a duvet  dosed up on cold medicine   and where was stevie  in the back  watching telly   dog races on sky  did he pop out at all   he was in all night  i'm tellin' ya  stevie wouldn't harm a fly   what's that on your arm   not what it looks like   well  it looks like somebody's hit you   he's got a temper  who hasn't   i can be really annoying  i know i can   so  stevie was in all night  you were in all night and that's it   anything else   about 10 00  i heard someone put the key in the lock   i knew stevie was in  so i went over and opened the door     and i heard some people running away   well  do you know who it was   i dunno   i just caught a glimpse  a glimpse   it might not even have been danny   cctv puts stevie at the flat at 1930 on the evening danny died   he leaves at 8 00 in the morning  he was at the flat all night   well  he might have nipped out the back   back alley's covered by a camera  he's in the clear   all right  we're back where we started   oh  ye of little faith   that's danny   and that other kid's the chatterbox from phoebe baxter's place   andy sefton   so that boy with the hood on could be the other lad   jono blake  yeah   and that's exactly the same time  they said they were at the cinema in camden   from this  they must have been among the last people to see danny alive   bring 'em in  first thing   it weren't me   you're on cctv  jono     standing next to danny just before he died   how do you know it's me  if it wasn't you   it was your body double  you were wearing a hoody   so you can't see my face   now  look  jono  let's keep this simple   what happened after you ran away from stevie's flat   i told ya  the three of us went to the pictures   then we went to the chippy  and what film did you see   i can't remember  i fell asleep   it was boring  just like this place   jono  mate  we checked the cinema's cctv   you weren't there   you've gotta stop lying   jono     you miss danny  what   you shared a room with him  so what do you think  when you look and see an empty bed  miss him  course i do   we were mates  how does that make you feel   wish he was still here   i bet you do   i bet you used to look out for each other an' all  eh  course we did   that's why i reckon that's gotta make you pretty angry  at the person who did this   jono     tell us what happened   you think you're so clever  don't you   you tell me   grub's up   andy here's been giving me the silent treatment   oh  it's probably cos he's hungry   don't look at 'em like that  they're not poison   i mean  they were made in our canteen but nobody's died yet   we don't want you to say anything you're not comfortable with  andy   god knows i've drummed it into my own boys    about the same age as you  actually   i've said   if ever you get in trouble with the police   don't sit there and make things up    that's the mistake everybody makes   they forget police have got forensics   dna  cctv   they'll know if you're lying   so  best thing is       tell the truth   everything'll sort itself out   and there's another big reason why you should tell us the truth  andy   for danny   he's not here to tell us what happened   as danny's mate  don't you think you owe him that   what about jono   he's my mate  too   what if he knows i told you   we'll look after you   you don't have to keep quiet any longer  andy   danny wanted some money so he and his mum could get a flat together   he said stevie had a load of music gear we could flog   when we heard someone in the flat  we ran   one minute  we're legging it and the next   jono just loses it   pushes danny over  blames him for people being in the flat   he started smashing his face in     stamping on it   it was like he was trying to bust him open   never seen nothin' like it before in my life   jono went mental   so  our prime suspect is a 13 year old kid  whose voice ain't even broken yet   i dunno  i need a minute to get my head around this  unbelievable   well  do you believe andy's story   little kid like jono does that to his mate   the facts all fit and it's definitely possible   i tell you what  if he did do it  the case could go nuclear   the press'll be all over him like a rash    phone ringing  cps  hello  alesha   are we done now  can i go   jonathan blake  we're charging you with the murder of daniel jackson   i'm gonna need summaries  of all murder or manslaughter cases from the last 30 years   where the killer was under 16   aw   still  bless   play nicely  bea  jono blake is innocent   he's just a scared little kid who's been stitched up by his mate     and you  he's on cctv with danny  minutes before the murder  his dna's all over danny's body  and his dms were covered in blood and human matter   yeah  well  obviously he was there  but andy sefton is bigger  older and stronger  that's your defense    andy did it   bea  that's rubbish   the facts don't fit  it'll take me two minutes to discredit it   yeah  well  when the jury look at big old andy  next to scared  little jono       we'll see who they believe   seriously  that's your case   i know her  she's up to something  that defense is way too simple   just because you two used to do the headboard shuffle  doesn't mean you have any insight into how she runs defenses nowadays   what  you and her  it was a long time ago   thanks for that  george  stop worrying about her  and ensure your case is unassailable   youth crime is our most sensitive issue   so no cock ups  no surprises  triple check every fact   go back to the families   biological parents  foster parents   comprehensive character profile of jono blake   that way  bea can't spring any traps   ok   oh  wrong   come on  son   ooh  pain au chocolat   how did you know my weakness for the french   jono blake's social services file says he was suspended from school   do you know why  the teacher said there was an altercation   did jono start this altercation  half the kids said he did   half said he didn't  this is a bribe  isn't it   can you get statements from all the kids  all of 'em    you are taking the michael  we need every angle covered   oi   how come he gets to have breakfast with you   leave it to me  sweetheart  i'm your man   leave what  what's he doing for you   you come in late  you miss things     ooh ah  chocolat   hey  do you want a coffee   i already told the police  jono ain't been my problem for a long time now   tell me about his dad   serving life in ashbridge with his brother   last time he came out  he swore blind he was going straight   more fool me  eh   was jono ever violent at home  he's a boy   they're all little thugs  as far as i can see   take a look round here  they're all the same   why was he taken away from you  i've been through this   i want to hear it from you  so i've got all the facts   i left him alone   once  overnight   i went for a drink with a guy after work   one thing led to another  next thing i know  it was morning   jono was fine  nothing had happened   but social services love sticking their noses in  don't they   sounds like you and jono have had a rough time   what would you know about a rough time   i grew up around the corner from here   whatever   jono's mum left him alone more than once   he's petrified of being left on his own   that's why he's always joking and mucking about   he thinks if you like him  you might stay around   and how did jono get on with danny  best mates  practically inseparable   two teenage boys sharing a room  they must have fought a bit   spent a day and a half sizing each other up   after that  i don't remember a cross word between them   they were closer than brothers   so you never saw jono being violent towards danny  or anyone else   it's not that simple  if he'd had once decent role model   things might have been different  he had you   and he was changing  kids are work in progress   i know bad kids  jono's not one of them   he murdered danny  mrs baxter   we have a duty to prosecute danny's killer   whose duty is it to speak for jono   they'll demonise him  lock him away  out of sight  out of mind   if we give up on our kids  it's a matter of time  before they give up on themselves   phoebe baxter and jono's mum could be talking about two different boys   their opinions are that polarised  doesn't matter  we deal in evidence   the facts of this matter   i feel a conscience pricking   jono's foster mum  the person who knows him best   says he shouldn't be abandoned   she feels that jono's a victim  too   really   cos i've just watched the mobile phone footage  of jono's playground attack on a classmate   jono wasn't the victim that day   he's 13  he goes into the prison system  he's lost for life   then he shouldn't have committed murder   staunch your bleeding heart  alesha  the victim is in the mortuary   we're crown prosecution  not crown empathy   a line has to be drawn on youth crime and we're drawing it   is that what you think   i think danny's mother needs us to provide justice for her son   all persons who have anything to do  with my lords  the queen's justices of the central criminal court   draw near    at least judge anderson agreed to hear the trial in private  and keep the public and the press out   god save the queen   case of crown and jonathan blake   imagine being in that dock when you were 13   i tried to stop him but he just lost it   it was like he was someone else   jono kept kicking danny over and over   i legged it cos     cos i was scared   out of the three of you  andy  who's the tallest   i am  and what weight are you   about ten or 11 stone   so would you say that you could beat danny and jono in a fight   i suppose   no further questions   is that it   that's it   my mum was out when social services took me away   and when they took you  how did that make you feel   sad  angry   then i went to miss b's  she looked after me  things were all right   no further questions   do you start a lot of fights  jono   no   do you remember martin taggart   do you remember martin taggart  jono   yeah  i went to school with him  you fought with martin   he started it  but you were fully aware  that you were causing him injury  so  he shouldn't have started it   isn't it true that no charges were pressed  because your father intimidated martin's parents   what's that gotta do with me  that fight was nothing  nothing   that's how you'd describe it   this mobile phone footage was filmed by a child in the playground   do you still think that was nothing  jono   it was the easiest prosecution i've ever had to make   she didn't raise a single objection  you should be delighted   mcardle's asked for the jury to be discharged   she's changed the basis of her plea   she's put in an application  for a re trial   the new defense she's running is that jono's not guilty  by reason of mental defect  what    she'll never make it home on an insanity defense   she's not saying he's insane   she's running 'non insane automatism'    an involuntary act committed while not conscious of actions taken   most of jono's blood relatives are in prison  her defense  is that jono is genetically predisposed to violent behaviour   oh  she can't run that  it's outrageous   we'd have every criminal in the country making the same case   what's she playing at    don't blame me  blame my genes    it's bold  i'll give her that   but let's not panic  no sane judge would let that get beyond a hearing   so who did we draw  judge dimarco   god  let's panic   for over 100 years now  scientists have seen a relationship  between genetics and human behaviour   my lord  relevance to crown and blake   researchers in scandinavia have identified a defective gene  that produces an excess of maoa    monoamine oxidase  judge  mono what  miss mcardle   break it down for the luddite in front of you   you do yourself a terrible disservice  my lord  oh  please   monoamine oxidase is an enzyme that destroys serotonin   which  as you know  regulates anger and aggression   the defective gene responsible for producing this enzyme  is commonly referred to as the 'warrior' gene   ok  and this has what to do with non insane automatism   jono has this defective gene  he couldn't control himself  any more than my learned friend here could wish himself younger   you've had him tested   conclusions from the scandinavian panel of experts  where they confirm jono has the warrior gene   my lord  if this becomes precedent   we might as well just open the gates of every prison in the land   with respect  that's not the issue   we're establishing the validity of putting this before jury   precedent   you name me one court that has accepted this defense   jerry robertson is on death row in arizona   he was given up for adoption as an infant   he has not seen and has not had any contact with his biological father  since that date  his biological father is also on death row   oh  please  cases pending supreme court ruling   my lord  science evolves  so  too  must the law   my lord  i will fill the court with experts who will refute this   call your experts  mr steel   we'll see who the jury believes   you know  for a second in there  i thought your head was gonna explode   bloody nerve  you wasted all that public money   made a mockery of the system  you're just miffed  i got the better of you  don't take it personally   i do this to everyone  what is this   are you grabbing a chance to make headlines  no   i'm trying to give my client the best defense   i needed time to get the legal precedent  test results  and then assess the scientific data  so  yes  i used the system    something you do every day   and what if you'd run out of time  jono could have been sent down   do you really think i would have let that happen   what are you so scared of  james   why would you want to suppress evidence   evidence knows no morality  we present it and a jury decides   it's unproven  the sample group is too small   it could just push the legal system off a cliff   well  make that argument in court   the law has survived dna samples  cctv  fingerprints   i think it will survive this   and what about jono blake   when this becomes public  the media will tear him to shreds   i'm doing this for him  he'll be fine   this is the english legal system on the verge of a nervous breakdown   george  what if mcardle is right   what if this warrior gene theory  there was a time when no court accepted provocation  as defense to murder  maybe this is one of those moments  when the law plays catch up with science   you make sure she's not right  i want you demolishing her  like a bulldozer  this warrior gene becomes precedent   then tens of thousands of cases will have to be retried   no criminal will be held responsible or accountable for anything   notice of appeal  applications in the event mcardle wins   we'll be drowning in paperwork by the end of the day   you should be happy  you got what you wanted   jono has an excuse   everyone's a victim now   i'll be at my desk   see  that's seven   no  eight  eight messages from    no  that'll be number nine   messages from the dpp   he'll be expecting me to tell him the legal floodgates will not open   this will never become precedent because i have my best on it  and he will demolish the defense   so i expect you to go in there and to do just that  james   tell me why you attacked danny  jono   i dunno   he was driving me mental   your eyes lit up when i said that   go on  write it down   mental  do you know how to spell it   jono  do you think your attack on daniel jackson was right or wrong   what sort of a stupid question is that   of course it was wrong   i killed him   he's aware of his actions and the consequences that follow from them   so he's not insane of schizophrenic   definitely not   tell me  honestly     do you think there's any validity to this warrior gene syndrome   can someone be born bad   genes are just one element of a larger picture   and all they give us is a predisposition   we still make our own behavioural choices   yes or no   is he responsible for what he did   from everything i've seen       yes  thank you   though i'm not sure  how jono will cope with the ordeal of a second trial   especially with all this public interest now   a few years ago  researchers in scandanavia found a mutated gene  linked to a violent family of rapists and arsonists  living in the netherlands  and could this warrior gene  compromise a person's sense of right and wrong   from the evidence i've seen  i don't believe so   thank you  doctor  no further questions   doctor   doesn't recent research  suggest that obesity and sporting ability  are passed genetically from parents to their children   it does  yes  so  by logical extension   we might pass our criminal behaviour to our children   the data from the warrior gene tests are not random enough  to form scientific conclusions   their sample bases are too small   they didn't test enough people  exactly   so you're saying that there's a     problem with the collection of the data but not the theory   are you proud   are you proud of what you're doing  of what you're saying in there   of all these lies and arguments and legal bullshit    my danny never hurt anybody   that monster in there is not the victim   go on  you're disgusting   get off   i'm fine   thank you   from the day he was born  we knew he was different   there was something odd about him   we just didn't know what it was  not till now   well  you know your son better than anyone  tracy   do you agree with the warrior gene theory   you saw what he did to that kid  it makes sense   thank you   did you discipline your son  mrs blake   jack hit him all the time  it didn't make any different  though    he never did what he was told   how about love   showing him some affection   did you ever try that  course i did   i used to think it was my fault   what do you mean  i wasn't a good enough mum   that i didn't deserve a kid   but that was before all this gene stuff   now i know there was nothing i could have done   it wouldn't have made any difference   papers are right   he's a monster   is that what you really think about your own son   you heard what they're saying about him   his genes are rotten   he's wrong   how many months' pregnant are you  seven   so  based on your belief in genes  we should take that baby  from your arms the second it's born and lock it up  no   surely genetics dictates your next child will be a monster  too   it'll be different this time   i won't make the same mistakes i made with him   no further questions   snap   are we still talking   oh  come on   i'm running a
