anything on     the public hate you    they hate us  inspector   their antagonists were 500 or  do you want a brew   just run along  gene   and do whatever it is that sub conscious recessional forms

in every department   the twat in the cells is edward markham  city trading ponce   heads up a drug dealership  you wanna sit in   feel good  does it   making money out of honest working class kids   turning them into ghosts and rent boys   firstly  mr hunt  you have absolutely no evidence   secondly  and according to this senior female officer   mirabile dictu  you were deliberately looking for a    what was it   yeah  fatality outcome   blowing my head off   ipso facto  my case rests   that's crap  and some of it was in klingon   if we wanted to murder you  we'd come round your house in the middle of     take no notice of my sergeant   he's very upset  his mother's ill in hospital   yeah  i'm  er       god  i hope she pulls through    yeah  bet you do   for the record  you will retract that remark   cocaine and heroin are flooding into this city   and you  my friend  are behind it   you're living in a fantasy world  mr hunt   where do they keep the most advanced radio in this station   wait for it   oh  god   it's like tomorrow's world  innit  boss  er  ma'am   i need to know what's going on out there  chris   i'm unconscious and i need reviving   i get that at weekends   yeah  but i'm convinced that this markham     yeah  all i ask  sir  is that markham     sir  there was never any question of one of my officers shooting an unarmed man   yes  these are difficult times and i am just trying to do my job  sir  goodbye   it's sony  i nabbed it off that drug dealer we nicked in the whorehouse   that's so sweet  i could've sworn that was mine   well  you're mistaken  sir   you know  mr hunt  in the city we're always looking for a good investment   like the chap who invented the walkman   you have to know when there's a new market ready to explode   that's my job   i see an exciting new product and    kapow   it's all about the future  and you know what   i don't think the future includes you   it would have been a sound nick if it hadn't been for her   fatality outcome  christ   got a good pair of honkers on her  though   women dls should look like a cross  between betty turpin and the hms ark royal   they should not look shag worthy   you can't give a person who gets periods that much responsibility   too right   talk to me  somebody   what's so special about you  gene   when good coppers go under  why do you appear    it's my aftershave   and stop wiggling your bloody fingers every time you say my name   now  we've got the makings of a drug epidemic in this city   i had the chief supplier and you gave him room to slide loose   markham   he's not your king pin   any cursory psyche assessment would show  he doesn't possess delegational inclinations   sorry  come again  i don't speak hindustani   top flight crime lords expect their minions to do their donkey work   they expend their energy only when it's absolutely necessary   crime lords don't gloat in police stations  gene   they don't spend money on expensive lawyers  and then do all the talking themselves   and they are not out to impress northern flatfoots like you   is this la di da posh bollocks meant to impress me   just look at me   look at me  i am trained to get inside the criminal mind  and now i'm stuck in my own    with you   whoopee   are you laughing at me   no  i just never thought it would seem this real   sam always said what amazed him most about this place was     look at you   it's beating  that's incredible   fan dabi dozi   now then  bollinger knickers  you gonna kiss me or punch me   arthur layton's a tinker with a minor record   we flipped him over  he keeps his eyes open  we don't bang him up   he has to be crucial to this   otherwise why is he in here   boss  i mean  ma'am   right  let's break it down   now  i was shot   the result of that act was my arrival in this    dystopia   dystopia  i had that once  i couldn't eat solids for a week   ah  baby   my mind creates a dark  twisted place for me to go to   my brain is in severe trauma  and so will not expend energy creating people that i don't need   therefore  everything here is significant   i am an empirical person   i break everything down and i study it  that's how i solve problems   so  your head has made up a puzzle for you to solve cos that's the best way     because that is the way that i will get strong   i must constantly analyse   hang about  analyse what   why you were shot   the moment it happened  i saw the bullet and i thought    this is it  alex  this is how it ends    like this was your destiny   like ben kenobi in star wars   now  where does that leave me   boss  ma'am   no  i'm not dead     hope you're happy  hope you're happy       hello   hello   hello   you're under arrest   who are you  then   it's all right  zippy     molly's my new friend    poor

layton     addresses  contacts  past offences    roger     i know what you're doing    really  whatever   what     new broom swings in    sweeps in   comes in iooking to make a quick collar  trying to impress the troops   i know he doesn't look like much  but layton is behind this   because that is why i'm here   let me show you something   we've monitored the drugs traffic across the division   movements  deals  everything  the centre is here   the financial district  now  markham is a right banker   he knows how to hide the drug money in any number of accounts   we're on the verge of a major bust  ma'am  like that operation poppadom   here you go  boss    ma'am   arthur layton  this is his business in shadwell   and past convictions for fencing stolen gear   look at your map  hunt   it's a web   the thing is  the spider isn't sitting in the middle   he's hiding on the edge   guv's right   layton's just a down at heels fella scratching a living together   no  he becomes that    one day   but not now  trust me   i'm sorry  ma'am  but the guv  he thinks you're trying to undermine us  like   look  all right  just relax  ok   chris    i know how this goes   hunt's the bullish one  ray's the misogynistic one   and you're the nervous one  blah blah blah  i don't care   i am going to stop arthur layton  because that could be the mental trigger to get me out of here  ok   roger that   i'm not nervous  i'm just cautious   hello   mr layton     police    can i help you   you're under arrest   arrest   what for   i've got receipts for all this stuff   i'm stopping you   i know you   what you talking about   chris  cuff him   don't look at me like that  don't like it   you have a network of drug dealers and money launderers under your control   including edward markham   no  i'm a barrow boy with a junk shop  you know that   you're under arrest and you are staying here   as much as it pains me   i think we may need something that can stick in court    you're staying here   probably won't do it   mr layton  do you have an appointed brief   no  i'll have to get one   oh  that's right  that's right  you let others handle it   the strategy of a powerful man with nothing to prove   a powerful man would bring his brief with him   guv  we've had a breakthrough   right  layton  off you go   thank you   we put the crime squad onto markham like you said   he made nine separate phone calls from phone boxes in the city district   all phone cards   phone cards   flash git   he then went and picked up a message from railway arches near tower bridge   something got him rattled   i know what got markham rattled  we pulled his boss in   he was checking to see if he could close the supply line down   layton is a control freak   being in the driving seat is essential to his emotional well being   where do you learn this hippy shit     langley    near macclesfield   virginia  secondment to the cia   here you go  ma'am  fresh clothes like you wanted   thank you  shaz   got 'em off a lady who was killed by a timothy whites van   that's brilliant   bring markham in again   shake the web  layton will hate that   psychiatry     psychology    same thing   still  not a bad idea for a bird   boys and girls  it is precisely  by 12 30  i want markham and his suspected accomplices in custody   mush   two arrests in two days  i've almost certainly lost my job at the bank   oh  bugger still  you're a smart boy   you'll get another job  i'll see you get arrested there and all   you'll be unemployable  markham   right then   time to talk turkey   gobble away   oh  that's very good  mr hunt   oh  mr hunt  no  no  no   just you   you knew tyler  didn't you   yes  i write about colleagues who've undergone unusual trauma   and i know he let you down   i thought he was gonna run out on us  but he came back   i'll give him that   sam came back   lucky us  eh   well  where is he   tyler died during a jewellery blag last year   i told him to wait for the guv  but he wasn't having it   gave chase  put his car in the river   twonk  never even found his body   oh  my god   he was here for seven years   he lived a life here and in reality he was seconds away from death     what    then my theory's right   in real life i might only have been shot a second ago   look  tyler didn't listen to the guv and look what happened to him   if you're smart  you'll learn that being where the guv is   is the right place to be   thank you  mr hunt   ladies   he's giving us the whole network   suppliers  dealers  drop offs   turn a blind eye to one last deal
