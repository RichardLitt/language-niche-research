being happy together   this is it  i can't make you happy any more  of course you can  you'll make me the happiest woman in the world   lorna  it's   it's over   not just the relationship  the wedding

look  we are not in a position to offer compensation   i don't think mr rimmer's going to take too kindly  to you listening in on his private conversations    yes  who is it   why don't you get the bloody parents to pay   they're the ones who brought them up   you can't be serious  from what i understand  this was a minor incident  that's been blown out of all proportion by some daft  have a go hero   erm  headmaster     do what you want  then   joker  trying to tell me they're not gonna bus our children to school   i'm sorry about being late   you know  i brought you here to set an example and on your first day     the  er   have a go hero     you're winding me up  aren't you    i witnessed a crime   i felt duty bound to intervene   your duty is to this school and to this headmaster   haven't we also got a duty to the pupils   i mean  to face them with the consequences of their actions   listen  andrew  this school is bang slap in the middle of hoodlum land   it may not suit the educational psychologists to say it   but it's a hard fact     nicking a bus ticket  well  it's      acceptable   it's not worth giving me a bloody headache over     jack rimmer   oh  great  the rochdale gazette   yes  i am aware of the incident   yeah  of course we have an anti bullying strategy   police have got an anti crime strategy   doesn't stop it happening   i am not being complacent

road comp    glad to be here     so  a bit different from your old school     just a bit   i think you'll find that the children here don't really like being regimented   they must be different from

seymour   and then they move house to avoid it   or they find god   we know we're just as guilty as the next  but how can we condemn our daughter to this   in basic reading skills   oh  it was 55  last year  wasn't it   i'm sure lucy's got no worries there   the great thing about coming to a comprehensive  is she's gonna see another side of life   and it's the greatest prep going for oxbridge these days  so i hear   anyway  let me show you around   i'm sure that mr treneman will be keen to make your acquaintance   i think that scout is scared of boo radley at first  because he's so

  well  then  you'd better sit down and tell me   because this is not stacking up   stupid       sergeant hendy    that's all i need     make a habit of this  do you    i'd rather leave it to you chaps   dear  oh dear  clarence  been throwing your weight around again   three times he punched my colleague here     in front of a classroom of 16 year olds    that right   oh  by the way  you do not have to say anything  but anything you do say     no  don't bother  i'm guilty  i hit him  he's a tosser   i confess  all right   not surprising  given there were 30 witnesses   well  that was easy  take him down the station and charge him   get off  get off   with his previous  you won't be seeing him again this side of 2010   good   erm  i'd better be getting back to my classroom     i've got donte charles in detention    great  more hassle     sorry    i was off my truck  recruiting you   here half a day and that's the second time you've had the police round     i'm sorry    i had two reject parents  from your kingsbury college in this morning   this close to their daughter giving us a boost up the league table  until they heard the rumpus from your classroom     you lost them    no  you lost them   are you trying to sabotage me   i'm trying to help you establish zero tolerance of bad behaviour   that's how you'll attract middle class parents    by laying down some rules and damn well sticking to them   which is what i'm off to do   you carry on like this  you'll have a punch up every week   if that's what it takes  i've got the stomach for it   but if every decision i take is going to be undermined  by the very person who should be giving me his support     look  izzie  this is none of your business  it's between me and lorna   i've just had to try and talk her out of killing herself   i'm supposed to be her bridesmaid on saturday   i've been involved in every sodding detail of your wedding from day one   i'm sorry   you don't suddenly tell the woman you're marrying you're not in love with her   what the hell else do you do  lie and go ahead with it   well  you're obviously lying about something     i thought i loved her  didn't i    what   and then suddenly  this morning  you realised you didn't   no  not just like     it's obviously myself i've been lying to  i feel sick about it   if you'd been having second thoughts   you should have said something to lorna straight off   i'm just trying do the right thing by her now   i hope one day she'll be glad about it   get real   there is someone else  isn't there   fine   if you wanna make me say it       yeah  there is    oh  jesus  tom  i knew it   who is it   if you're so bloody clever  you should be able to work it out  shouldn't you   work out what     izzie  izzie  wait    sod off  tom     you said i should've talked about it    yeah  go and talk to lorna   look  please    we can't leave it like this   well  i can  just don't you ever tell lorna what you've just told me   it's the truth  i love you     rubbish    i want you to tell me the truth now   tell me what you really feel about me   don't you dare think of blaming any of this on me   andrew  can i have a quick word   erm   i'd rather you didn't use my first name in front of the pupils   what  a state secret  is it   perhaps you haven't heard of the old proverb   ''familiarity breeds contempt ''  mm   no  no  you got me there   maybe i should have gone to a posh school like yours   whatever advantages i've had  i'm trying to share them with these kids   beginning to understand why you got a punch in the mouth   wait a minute   i haven't got time to discuss your hang ups  i need to speak to donte   i've had his social worker on and he's got to go into care tonight   crikey     why    because his father's in a police cell   he's a single parent  er  the mother walked out four years ago     he's brought his son up on his own    oh   did you not think of the consequences before you decided to confront him   he assaulted me  what is it here  you've lost sight of what's right and wrong   excuse me  i'm not gonna be lectured   these kids know they can create hell and get away with it   thanks to teachers like you explaining it away   have you any idea what we're dealing with at waterloo road   are from single parent homes     it doesn't mean they shouldn't behave    no  it doesn't   but it causes difficulties    god knows what percentage are on drugs   we've got the highest underage pregnancy rate in the whole country     basically  we're talking poverty    if you lower your expectations  of what poor kids can achieve  they'll stay poor   yeah  and meanwhile  in the real world  we've got a kid about to go into care  because of your back to basics rubbish   oh  another statistic for you   over 50  of kids in care end up in prison  so well done  andrew   you've made such a difference already   kim   obviously  i don't want the boy put into care       hi  we're looking for clarence charles    are you his lawyer   no  i'm his son's pastoral care teacher  kim campbell   this is mr treneman  the victim of his assault     can we speak to him    he's not the chatty type   we've got a proposition that he'll want to listen to   miss campbell  what are you doing here   oh   i suggest you sit down  keep your trap shut and your ears open  charles   we're both here for your son's benefit   he's a thief   have you ever had to confiscate anything from donte  mr charles   presumably as a punishment for something   yeah  sometimes   right  well  while your child is at our school   right  we treat him like our own child   yeah  we care for him and  like a parent  sometimes have to discipline them   do you think he should've been using his phone in class   he had his reasons   and so do 29 other pupils  which is why nobody is allowed to use their phone   surely you can see that     he called me a thug    that's how you behaved   what do you call someone who punches people in the face for no good reason   look  i'm not proud of what i done  right  i lost it   but if my boy asks me for back up     you need anger management classes  mr charles   yeah  and i'm gonna get 'em inside  aren't i   and while you're inside   your son is gonna be bedding down in a local authority home   look   i'm prepared to give you a second chance   drop all the charges if you're prepared to cooperate   today  there was a very serious assault on a member of my staff   the man who assaulted him would like to say something        me name's clarence charles   i want to apologise to mr treneman   and anybody in his class  for my assault on him this morning   i was out of order   he could have got me sent to prison  and me son  donte  put into care   so i'm very lucky to be let off   cos it's not worth it for a stupid mobile     which shouldn't be used in lessons   right  son   and i'll see he doesn't do it again  mr rimmer   i give you me word  thank you   just so you know  this is now a zero tolerance school  for violence against teachers   there's a big sign going up outside the gates    ''we always prosecute violent parents ''  and we will exclude any pupil whose parents assault my staff   so go home and tell your mums and dads   i'm not having it   teachers  dismiss your tutor groups   thanks for saving the day  kim   i suppose i should thank you  too   if you want to   oh  god  you're tricky   come on  son  let's get summat to eat  we've got a lot to talk about  yeah   you what  you just disrespected me in front of the whole school   ain't going nowhere wi' you       hello    iz  it's me  did you speak to tom   yeah  er  lorna  can i ring you back  i'm driving   sorry     get out    for god's sake  please  just listen to me   hurry up   i've been fighting these feelings for months  honest   but it's not a daft crush  you're the point of my day     i've tried to get you out of my head  but      well  try harder   what  that's all you've got to say   what d'you want me to say  ''move in''   i want to know what you want in your life  izzie   cos i don't think i've cooked up these feelings all by myself   d'you know  it's almost funny  you don't know the first thing about my life   in fact  i don't have a bloody life   i've got a job and two kids and that's all i can cope with   so why don't you take your feelings away from me and give them

much lorna and i owe her for    helping us be here today   she's been our rock  and  er     well  she knows   so  ladies and gentlemen  if you'll join me in raising your glasses   to the best man and the bridesmaids    best man and bridesmaids              we should all have been at this wedding    your mum said you didn't want to go   didn't wanna go cos she wouldn't go with you   can't stop me taking you out for treats  though  we'll still have a good time     when    oh  i'll fix something up     why don't you go back to shelley  dad    i don't think so   well  why don't we all go back to

watching telly    i'll have to check with her first     who cares what she says    hey   mind you  she'll probably accuse me of spoiling her evening   i'll just see where shelley's at   i'm going to my room   i first met lorna when we were students   she found me crying my eyes out in the union loos  cos i'd had my handbag stolen  and all i wanted to do was walk under a bus   but lorna said it might be better if i reported the theft   cancelled my credit cards   and let her buy me a drink   well  that's my idea of a true friend   and so is my other best mate there   tom   in fact   i'd say he was the perfect man   if only he'd give up man city and support newcastle   anyway   they're perfect together   so  to lorna and tom    to lorna and tom       don't they make a lovely couple   yeah

louder   there you go   that's what i'm talking about  man   but  see  the problem with you  is that you don't even think you've got a problem   education isn't a science  you can't just bung x and y together  and get z  all children are different   are they  i like to emphasise what makes them the same     but you    oh  you can't    sorry  andrew     yes    are you sober   yes  why   well  i'm not  and i've just had a call from the cops   there's been some incident at the school     hey  chlo  you drinking tonight    hell  yeah   attagirl  man     hey  chlo  come in the front    yay   you all right   you getting through    oh  my god  chlo  what you doing     whoa  look out      cool   you idiot     police said it was three teenagers from the estate   every blasted thing they could swing a hammer at   pretty purposeful   izzie's year 8s worked on this for weeks   you see what we're up against now   this is the aggro we have to deal with  day in  day out   just fill in another insurance claim  that's all you can do   if i could get me hands on the little scumbags now   i've had it up to here with 'em     come on    look around you  it's too late   all you can do is pick up the pieces   what  so we just   write them off  do we     you've got no idea  have you    listen to yourself   if you really don't believe that we can make a difference  resign   walk away  let them rot   what is it with you  why are you doing this     well  it's not for the money    why   because     this is the career i chose   and   kids like these  have most need of good teachers   teachers who   don't underestimate them   there's plenty of proof  it's possible to turn schools like this around   you don't know what it's like  to stand in front of a class every day  and to know that not one child  and i mean not one   will even reach grade e   well  let's make that our first task   one grade e at key stage 4   it's an improvement  isn't it   we could be really ambitious and make it a d   the school could be closed by the end of the year  anyway   so we have a deal    i can't make deals without a drink in me hand     you've had too much to drink  man    i can't hear you  what you saying   yes       what are you doing in there   having a fight   i broke a glass and knocked the bin  sorry   oh  it's just as well i'm not waiting to lose my virginity tonight   blame grantly budgen   no wonder his wife eats for two  all he does is drink   it's funny you should say that   because somebody else is eating for two now   nobody can say that's why we got married  can they   because you couldn't have been forced by a fact you didn't know about   that's why i made myself wait until tonight   so i knew you really wanted to marry me   what are you saying   i'm pregnant   you're going to be a father  tom   i don't want some poxy rose  i just want my twin brother   i just want my brother back   you snidey cow     you don't talk to her like that    i'll talk to her how i want     feeling naughty  miss haydock
