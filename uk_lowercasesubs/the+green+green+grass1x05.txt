  i'm getting tired of the city all the noise and the mess    want a new beginning and a new address    why don't we run away to somewhere where the birds still sing     i want the green green grass and a country house    in a place where my face ain't known   and in the green green grass it'll come to pass    we'll have somewhere to call our own    we'll have somewhere to call our home    farmer boyce  you all right   what  yes  fine    bad night  sir   yes   yes  for the past couple of weeks  mrs boyce has been keeping me awake at night   has she now  well  it's the time of year    what's that mean   you've heard of the pheromones   no  where do they live   they don't live anywhere  sir  they're in the air   they're all around us now   it's the mating season  sir   and the pheromones is nature's aphrodisiac   they're entering our bodies with every breath we take    it effects everything in the country  man and beast   they're all out there now   rabbits  foxes  ducks   swans  all going at it like billy o   good god  man   there's nothing like that between me and mrs boyce   there are no pheromones in our bedroom   we've got a battery powered airwick device   just had a little difficulty sleeping  that's all   but if these pheromones affect man and beast   why isn't this useless great article getting in amongst them cows    who  rocky   yes  rocky   he's not interested in anything like that  sir  is he   i can't have been thinking straight when i bought him   i mean  with a name like rocky   i should have known things weren't all what they seemed   bryan  well  he looks like every other bull you've ever seen  don't he    arr  but he ain't   no  he's different    the vet could have been wrong  couldn't he   no  he's a good vet    arr  ain't he just   no  bryan's right   i'm gonna demand a second opinion    memo to vet   how can you be absolutely certain my bull is gay   right  you two better wait in here   while we speak to the vet   arr   there must be some kind of mistake  i've never heard anything like it   i'm afraid farmer boyce is gonna have to face the facts    arr  there's no point hiding from it   no    he's gay  and that's all there is to it   arr   i mean  fair enough  he don't look gay   but then neither did michael barrymore   in my capacity as farm manager   i explained to farmer boyce that once the programme's up and running   we're gonna have to start extracting his bodily fluids   and then we'll put it in the deepfreeze and put it in the shed   yeah   morning  ma'am  didn't know you were there   i hope we didn't disturb you  ma'am  we were just discussing this situation with  er    rocky  the bull   oh  the bull   for a moment  i    i'm gonna have to sit down again  i don't feel well   may i just say  ma'am  you look very well for somebody so sick   oh  thank you  could you ask mrs cakeworthy to make me a strong coffee    jed   oh  yeah    mrs cakeworthy   yes  m'dear   could you make mrs boyce a strong coffee  please   ah  the chawls are yina fiddin  like the salves on a fust pepper stuck right up the end of me hoover   i'll make you one  shall i   the vet's not there  so i've had to leave him a message   don't see how he can be certain about anything   i mean  it's not like rocky's come out of the closet  is it   it's not like he sat down with the vet and he said  ''i'm coming out  i'm a gay bull   ''and i'm proud of it and i want the world to know '' is it    no   no   bull's can't speak  bryan   i know that  ma'am  i'm the herdsman  i know bulls can't speak   although once    no  no  no   listen  maybe rocky don't fancy none of them cows  eh   you know what it's like  you go to a discotheque and it's full of women   and you don't fancy none of them  or maybe none of the women fancies you   oh  yeah   so  maybe it ain't rocky  maybe it's the cows   so  what you're saying is i haven't got a gay bull    arr   we've just got 300 lesbian cows    it's possible  ain't it   anything's possible    not that  though   it can happen   i mean  how many times you gone into a discotheque  and then found out it's lesbian night  eh   no sign outside  but they still takes your money  don't they   and the women still lets you pay for drinks for them  don't you   and cuba libres and cider and peach schnapps   i mean  is it any wonder that people write offensive words on the door to the ladies' toilet    i mean  it's bound to happen  ain't it   all right  bryan    which it don't seem fair to me   take it easy  now  come on   let's leave these good people in peace and go get back to our work  come on  now   the postman called earlier and delivered this letter   i thought it was very odd   oh  yes  that is strange  isn't it  a postman delivering a letter   i mean  that is straight out of the x files   what i mean is  since the dulerm garpin werry and you moved into this house   you haven't received one single letter  it's like nobody ever writes to you   or maybe nobody knows where you're living   oh  yes  that's because we left london rather suddenly   and we're only just getting around to sending out our change of address cards   oh  it's actually addressed to your lad  tyler  it's from the local school   it'll be his gcse results   he's been hoping to begin his a level studies shortly   really  oh  dear   i hope you don't mind me asking   but why did you have to leave london so suddenly   because a woman moved in next door to us who was extremely nosy   she was so nosy  i actually offered her a job just so i could sack her   i hates them sort of people  i have rules   anyone says anything to me  or i sees something   like her in the village with the gonsbabblelite and the chawlser cufflins   it stays inside here  i don't go round gossiping  not like her   and she's got nothing to gossip about anyway   her old man's two timed her three times to my knowledge   so that's a nol frash barble  annit   i suppose so   and she has the brass buddle to accuse me of being nosy    me   no   hard to believe  i know  she said it straight to my face   well  it wasn't straight to my face  i read it in her diary  but it's the same thing   there you go  a nice strong coffee   oh  that's lovely  my dear  just what i needed    shall i make you another one  ma'am   no  it's 1 0 00  i'll have a tequila    well   how many passes do you need to take a levels    five   yes    how many did you get   two   two   well  it means i don't have to go to that new school  don't it    well  i don't know  darling   look at this  marlene   he's got an e for french  an e for geography and an e for science   he's got more e's than a can of cream soda   that's your fault  before we left peckham   you were the one who insisted i took all me exams in three days    but there was a contract out on me   oh  it's all self  self  self  innit   so i had to sit art  science  music  history   geography and french in three days   that's six exams in three days  that's     how many exams a day    you forgot maths   exactly  seven exams in three days   what chance did i stand  i would love to do those exams again   not only to prove to you   but more importantly  to prove to me that i could have done it   well  you can  look  your new school says you can do retakes   oh  crap   that reminds me  how's he do at english   boycie  boycie  you awake   boycie   what in god's name do you think you're doing   i thought you might be dead    why   because you were very quiet and weren't moving   well  that's called sleep   i saw a doctor shine a torch into a patient's eye on holby city   well  thank god you didn't see that programme about colonic irrigation    i been thinking   oh  god  no   we're on the run from the mafia  right   so  we ought to change our names  what do you think   i don't know   you know  i feel as though i've had an accident in a lighthouse   you're gonna go on and on about that  ain't you   wish i hadn't woke you now   when i was younger   i always wished my mum had named me ursula   ursula  are you feeling all right   after ursula andress   you remember when she walked out of the sea and started talking to sean connery   oh  yeah   no  think of something else   why   well  you're not an ursula  are you   you're more of a sort of a    i don't know      joyce   joyce    all right  be ursula then  i don't care   what about you   i've never even thought of changing my name   leave off  your name's aubrey  you must have thought of changing it   don't you tell anyone my name's aubrey   i won't have to tell them  will i  'cause you'll have a different name    go on  what you gonna call yourself   i don't know   i mean  it could be anything  couldn't it  i mean  who knows   lance    lance   what's wrong with lance   no  it wouldn't suit you  not you  no   anything but lance   i mean  lance bovary   bovary  what's that  then   it's from that film madame bovary   the minute i saw that film  i wanted to be ursula bovary   how do you spell bovary   marlene  this is the most ridiculous conversation you have ever started   and that is saying something   i mean  here we are talking about exchanging identities with two people  who can't even spell their own bloody surname    i mean  it's 4 00 in the morning   it's all right for you  but i can't sleep   i'm just laying here with no one to talk to   it's these nights in the country  they're just so dark   i mean  out here it's not just night  it's more like a near death experience   you don't know what a near death experience is until you've been woken up at 4 00 in the morning  by some moron shining a laser beam straight into your retina   you just won't let it go  will you  you're like a jack russell with an old sock    good night   good night   i'm all right during the day  it's just the nights   they've got my body clock right up the wall   marlene  we have moved to shropshire  we haven't crossed any time zones   it's the silence as well  it's too loud   and it's everywhere  all you can hear is nothing   sometimes we hear that owl   oh  yeah  that really sends me off in a sound sleep   bloody owl  sounds like dracula's budgie   up in london  you used to hear all sorts of sounds in the night   planes flying overhead  motorbikes   cars screeching round corners   police and ambulance sirens  it was comforting   i didn't need sleeping pills in peckham   no  'cause you were virtually legless from our nights at the nag's head   i meant i used to drop off to the sounds of the city   it was like my favourite lp   course   you could always do that other thing that always made me sleepy   no  i'm sorry  i've had a good look and you're out of luck   you finished the last of the ovaltine on tuesday   marlene  my little iguana   tomorrow is tyler's first day back at school  we gotta be up in a few hours   for god's sake  come back to bed and try and get some sleep   yeah  all right   that farm manager of yours was telling me that out here in the country   they have these things called pheromones   all the animals and the people just sort of get off on them   they just float about in the air   well  you've been out in the air all day long   so you must have sniffed a few million of them up that nose of yours   so  i was thinking      what you going to do   i just remembered  i bought another tin of ovaltine on thursday   tyler  come on  darling  wake up   it's the first day at your new school  don't want to be late   yeah  okay  i am up   have you heard about this 21 st century farming exhibition thingamajig   yeah  it's starting in london  then going all round the country  eh   yeah  opens in earls court   and my brother in law has managed to wangle me a free ticket   and farmer boyce very kindly  has said i can take a short break out of my holiday entitlement   i actually said  ''you can sling your hook for as long as you like  ''because you are one useless git ''  yeah  that was it  yeah  so  anyway  tomorrow i'm off to london   jed  wait a minute  that means you gotta go all the way down to london   yeah    and pay a train fare   arr    and then pay for hotel or bed and breakfast   right   and then pay another fare and get another train back here   right   whereas if you wait three weeks  the whole exhibition is coming to ludlow   ten mile up the road   yeah  but i ain't got a free ticket for that one  have i    but he's got you there  hasn't he   i didn't think of that  though   so  where's this come from   it was part of the old squire's collection  he loved his ferrets   used to be breed them  then he'd shoot them   i could never understand what he saw in them   i mean  what is a ferret  it's a posh rat    if you would be so kind  mrs cakeworthy   my pleasure  sir   you be careful down south  jed  people go to london and they change   look at madonna  she's all yol kapputz and a yom kebab  annit   she's right  ain't she  sir  there's some funny people down in london   yes  most of them were my friends    i'm only going for one night   yeah   here  i might have a walk round soho  it's an interesting place  so i'm told   actually  jed  you might be able to do my wife and me a favour   oh  yeah  of course  what is it   well  as you know   mrs boyce recently has had trouble sleeping at night   now  to cut a long story short  there is something she is missing   and unfortunately i can't provide it  but i think you can   pardon me  sir  but as farm manager   i ought to be doing that for mrs boyce   no  this is something only jed can do   you see  the reason my wife cannot sleep is because she misses the sounds of the city   that urban symphony that used to waft through our mock georgian bedroom window every night   those background noises the brain is used to   like bryan with his badger's bark   yeah  i can't sleep a wink at night unless i hear that old brock screeching through the night   yes  now  what i would like you to do  is to capture all the sounds of the city on this tape recorder   the speeding motorbikes  the low flying aircraft   the emergency vehicles racing to the scene of some disaster or another   all the sounds that will reassure mrs boyce   ah  you leave it to me  sir   tyler  this is the last time   after we drop you off at school  i'm going shopping  proper shopping   so get yourself down here or i'll come up and drag you out   i'm up  i'll be down in a minute    well  that seems to have done the trick   he's up now   he'll be up all day   it was cruel  boycie   how would you like to wake up with some horrible thing staring back at you   i thought the driscoll brothers had found us   the driscoll brothers are south london mafiosi   now  what would they be doing putting an itsy bitsy little ferret on your pillow   the godfather  yeah  the horse's head in the bed   for god's sake  tyler  you are a 1 6 year old schoolboy  sitting his gcse retakes   you're hardly a threat to the cosa nostra  are you   this is so unfair   i failed every exam they put in front of me and i still gotta go to school   so much for human rights    come on  tyler  you're a man now   if i'm a man  why you sending me to school   because you are gonna get an education whether you like it or not   i'm not having you growing up like some of my mates  sweeping the streets  or fly pitching in markets   i'm not gonna know anyone at this school   you'll soon make friends  won't he  mrs cakeworthy   yes  you'll have a friend  but he might not be real   you're just a bit nervous and that's natural   but you're a sixth former now   you don't have to wear a uniform and you're only doing retakes   i'll never pass any exams   now  you've got to believe in yourself  tyler   if you believe in yourself  you can be anything you want to be   now  you listen to your mother   now  you'll have to work at it  nobody pays wages for daydreams    but if you have a dream     and you believe in yourself     then you can achieve anything you want   i want to be olympic high jump champion   don't be bloody stupid   don't dash his dreams like that   for god's sake  marlene  how can he be olympic high jump champion   you've gotta be seven foot one and russian   when i said you can achieve anything you want  i mean anything within reason   well  come on  we don't want to be late  do we   i don't mind being late  you're the one that don't want to be late   you just want to dump me in some classroom and get off to the shops   sod tyler  show me the shoes   how can you say that about me  your own mother   if you knew the suffering i went through to have you   i was at the hospital  i could hear her   oh  yeah  and then there was the labour   god  the pain   i'm going outside   there are times when a woman has to cry alone    you the new boy   yeah    from london   yeah   thought so    are you any good   all right    you   no   oh  thank heavens  i thought you might be the headmaster   no  it's just me    sorry  i'm new here   oh  you must be tyrone  is it    tyler   oh  yeah  heard you were starting today    i'm rhian   nice to meet you   i'm new here as well  started last week    we're sort of brother and sister in arms   are we    do you know your timetable yet   yeah  they sent it to me  my first class is english   me  too  see you there   sorry  that seat's reserved   reserved  it's a classroom  not an indian restaurant   i know it's a classroom  but that seat is still reserved  all right   rhian  rhian  i've got you a seat   okay  quiet    good morning everyone   all  morning  miss   as you can see  a new student has joined our ranks  tyler boyce   who i'm sure you'll all get to know during the course of the day   but more importantly  we're continuing with thomas hardy's far from the madding crowd   so  if you take your books out  please   we finished chapter 1 8  so if you turn to page 1 03 and continue reading chapter 1 9   and remember  we're looking at the relationship between gabriel oak and bathsheba   their differing aspirations  their outlooks and needs   spiritually  socially and sexually   so  turn to page 1 03 and continue reading   tyler  you've joined us late in the term  so unfortunately you're playing catch up   so  i was wondering if you'd like to stay behind after school   and you and i could get together on a kind of one to one basis   yeah  yeah  i mean  yeah  that sounds good  yeah   we'll have a long session   yeah   great   eh  the skateboard  shall i take it   no  no   okay  keep it for now  but it's against school rules   and if you don't mind me saying so  it's a teensy bit childish for a big lad like you   it's not actually mine  i'm just looking after it for someone    i'll give it back to him later   good   well  jed seemed to enjoy london  he's been talking about it all day   made me feel quite homesick   i don't know if he even went to that farming exhibition   he seems to have spent most of his time in soho   oh  that reminds me   i asked him to get something while he was up there   well  actually  it's for you  'cause you'll get the pleasure out of it   i just hope he hasn't run the batteries down   that's a funny one  innit   well  it's my pocket recorder   while jed was in london  i asked him to record some sounds of the city   i thought it might help you get a good night's sleep   oh  boycie  that's really thoughtful of you   yes  well  i'll just put this on the stereo   have you noticed the change in tyler since he's gone to this new school   he threw his skateboard on the bonfire   and he seems to be really into this new high jump lark he was talking about   he practises nearly every evening in his bedroom   every time i pass his door  his bedsprings are twanging like a trampoline   well  good  a boy of his age needs a hobby   yeah  love him   right  heads down  lights out  and curtain up   jed on tape  hello  farmer boyce     farmer boyce   shh   well  here i am in my hotel in london   and about to record some city sounds for mrs boyce   all right  here it goes  first  a motorbike   and now a train   followed by a police car   and an ambulance   and then a fire engine   oh  i have to stop now   somebody's banging on the wall  over and out     i'm getting tired of the city all the noise and the mess    why don't we run away to somewhere where the birds still sing     i want the green green grass and a country house    in a place where my face ain't known   and in the green green grass it'll come to pass    we'll have somewhere to call our own    we'll have somewhere to call our home
