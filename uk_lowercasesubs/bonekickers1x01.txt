wasn't a couple of peasants having a scrap over a bit of skirt   no  it appears to be a skirmish  between professional soldiers and the turks   here in the heart of england    there's no record of any battles here  between the roman occupation and cromwell   he's right  this is re writing the books stuff      we have to show our faces at that faculty thing   pull a sickie   i'll have the finds

benefits  2  of profits from my latest book  will be ploughed directly into this department   soon to be a channel five series   one drink and we're leaving   patients can't stop talking about it   it's exciting   are they really soldiers   either stand in the site or away from it  but not on the edge     sorry    sorry   i'm helena  i work at the hospice   anyway    sorry   look at this   soldiers put nails in the soles to get a better grip in battle   see   is that the other sandal there   do you want to give me a hand   yeah  ok   ok  after three  one  two  three   oh  look at your finger   oh  it's just a splinter   thank you so much for coming   thank you   get yourself a manicure      i can't help it       i'm just a grubby wee digger   yes  what is it you've found that the local hacks are buzzing about   medieval soldiers  slain in combat   yes  well  with military finds best to start  with weapon identification   analyse your sword sections   well  with your permission  i'll get on it now   well  take a copy of the book   sex rites 0f the ancients  nice title   from aztec nuptials to the virgin molestations of caligula   antiquity with titties and front bottoms   i read your last one  napoleon goes a bonking   i merely outline a common truth   that history runs on the twin motors of human behaviour     sex and greed   you're not shy in splashing yourself about   but not for money       there's a name for someone who does that   your know your mother would never have exchanged such cheap barbs   too sure of her brilliance   how is she  any change     so can we go now    yes   he's gotten to you already  is that a record     come on    0h   well  i hate to say it  but mastiff was right   now  look at that hilt  it's not from europe at all   well  that makes sense  because a european broad sword could not administer that wound   no  and i printed up a list of possibilities  look   middle eastern scimitar   in the middle ofthe english countryside   that doesn't make any sense at all   hold the front page   i've got the carbon 14 dating on the bone collagen   our soldiers fell between 1300 and 1320   hmmm    the ionisation from the chain mail preserved it   looks like your classic z spun medieval cotton   let's clean it up and see what it looks like under uv   looks like we've found the identity of our guys   knights templar   james  if you want to get better  then you need to keep drinking   come on  stay in bed until the temperature comes down   come on   when we were little boys  colm     what did the brothers tell us   that our founders were betrayed by those they had protected   that our temple founders were butchered   butchered by the enemies of christ   i've just been down the court house   brother laygass has been acquitted   mr laygass  will ofcom choose to close down your tv show   well  i go out on a niche christian channel so      you've been denounced by the archbishop of canterbury   you said that this country is now at war for its christian soul   well  what i've said is that the day is coming  when st paul's cathedral will be the grand mosque of london  yes   but do your supporters advocate violence against non christians   you are missing the use of the simile in one of my favourite hymns   it's onward christian soldiers  marching as to war   with the cross of jesus going on before   what about the allegations linking you  with the recent hate crimes against muslims          mr       any comment   are we talking about the knights templar   yeah  the poor fellow soldiers of christ   warrior monks charged with safe guarding pilgrims on their way to jerusalem   they were a monastic order   built hospitals and schools   but they were also the church's sas troops   soldiering elite of the crusades   not to mention the mass slaughterers of countless muslims   two knights on the same horse   poverty as a badge of honour   our knights date back to the early 1300s   that's when the church turned against them  right   the young lady with the proceleusmatic bosom is right   the templars were deemed too radical   king phillip of france outlawed them in 1307   the arrests began on friday the 13th   hence that date is unlucky   write it down   impress your friends at parties   so  our knights escape france   they come to england   but they're ambushed   by saracens  if you believe the coins  but that's patently crazy   i think they had a wooden cart or something with them  i found this   no  they were sworn to poverty   even carts were a luxury  what kind of wood is this   erm  i can tell you what it's not   it's not sycamore or oak  or ash   let's do dendrochronology on it   dr magwilde   have you found the templar knights   who is this   i've been looking for them too   a long time   identify yourself  creepy caller   and what about their precious cargo       i don't know what you're talking about   do you pray   dr magwilde   funnily enough i'm praying now  that you would bog o      hallelujah  it worked   jesus  please be with jack at this time of his passing from the world   lay your hand on him  lord   you who died for our sins  have mercy on this man   be alongside him   comfort him in his pain   for you know pain  lord   you who hung on a hill       and bled for the sake of the world   one of our pert little third years pulled this out   it definitely belonged to a grandmontine   well  the grandmontine monks were the chroniclers of the templar   so there's a good chance one was travelling with them when they were attacked   why has he carved a snake and a sword on the back   look how this seems to have been snapped   as though it were yanked from his neck    by force   so    europe turns against the knights   a small band flee france  and wind up here   they head north  looking for a templar church as refuge   a grandmontine monk is travelling with them  and they're attacked by saracens   which is patently absurd   what if the knights brought something from france   a precious cargo     and they're killed for this cargo   the only thing precious to the knights templar  were spiritual relics from the holy land   what if jesus could be proved   that would light a fire in all our hearts      even in those who had no faith   'in my father's house  there are many mansions '  so said jesus   wouldn't those mansions soon be filled  with christian souls   the believers would drive out those  who did not follow the truth   just as we did a long time ago   when the call comes   i will be ready   tea's up   fantastic   biccies   i'm so glad i've got a degree  rich tea or bourbons   never ceases to amaze me   all these centuries of bloodshed in the name of religion   well  it's not always like that   the nastier stuff always leaves a bigger impact on history  that's not how god works   you were presumably brainwashed by god bothering parents   no   i didn't know my parents   but holy wars  crusades     it's the big stuff   i always thought god was found in the quiet corners   in the little things   in the little things  i like that   right  are you ready for this   first off  wood type is cedar   cedar    that takes it out of europe   the pattern of rings puts it at 32ad    i found a match   gundelia   found in syria  jordan  israel   the holy land  anyone   a piece of 2 000 year old wood from the holy land   carried by the knights templar   who we know were entrusted with christian relics from jerusalem   but     that isn't the best bit   there's organic residue in the wood   soaked in   like blood   mixed with metal traces   ok  gently  bentley  let's not get carried away   i'm not getting carried away       i'm telling you what i found   evidence that 2 000 years ago   someone may have been lacerated with a metal nail  and bled into this wood   we're under pressure for the construction company   they want us to seal off the find   protect the site with concrete and let them build      there could be something highly significant still down there   as well as cedar wood       a cross beam of a roman built crucifix   we're walking geo phys across that site looking for the rest   there is another factor  another potential buyer for the site   someone who won't build on it  but has an interest in preserving it   who   do you in all seriousness believe that you have found  part of the cross of jesus christ   daniel  look  let us walk out the site  sink another trench   hold the developers and whoever else at bay for now   please   i've had word from brother laygass   there's a dig happening in the west country  soldiers  medieval      the location    it's the secret road from the coast   we have to get word to the others   be prepared   for what   for war   so   mastiff said that you asked for a placement here and nowhere else   well  this is where it's all happening   you had the pick of the crop  why here   pin on a map   ok  don't tell me   but i hope you like getting into trouble   because gregory's right about religious faith   it is the gunpowder of humanity   if we do find what we think we may have found   then every zealot  crackpot and fanatic  will be down on our dig site like a tonne of bricks   what has happened to our christian identity   has it been eroded   or have we sold the lord down the river  to appease an ever broader stream of spiritual aliens   no  you see  i'm looking for monastic writings  pertaining to the templar exile from europe   the grandmontines  yes   can you e mail me   it's the thing you do with a computer   well  i would have thought even you  abbot  would     the writings have come up for auction    no  father  i'm fine   this is me smiling   thank you very much   i have asked the lord for one thing   one thing only do i want    to live in the lord's house all my life   to marvel there at his goodness   in times of trouble he will shelter me   he will keep me safe in his temple  and make me secure on a high rock   so i will triumph over my enemies   with shouts of joy i will offer     gilly  you should see this   i've never seen a patient recover when so close to death   your colleague told us you came into contact with a piece of ancient wood   yes  i told my colleagues that  i helped a student archaeologist pull it out of the ground   and is it true that this wood is biblical  perhaps 2 000 years old   i don't know   would you describe what you saw today as a miracle   how the hell did the press get on to this   i didn't say anything   you let a layman help you on a dig site    i     i'm sorry   hayley  call the university   any member of the rugger squad looking to earn cash       tell them to get down here      dr magwilde  a few questions   remove your stringy buttocks from my dig   have your team uncovered part of the true cross  and is the rest of it still there   yes  and last week we tripped over the holy grail  next week we are going after atlantis   but that's the reputation that ruined your mother      going after the exotic to prove     ok  ok  look  we're very busy   broke her career and broke her spirit   dear edward  i know why we can't beat bin laden   he and his lot have faith   they may be wrong  but at least they have that   whereas we have the true faith in jesus   but we don't stand up for it   and that is where the muslims and others have us over a barrel   james  we must test our resolve   don't doubt  not for a second   we must prove our faith   the knights awake   excuse me  can we help you  this is a place for muslim study    you're opponents of edward laygass   laygass  he incites violence   the white wings alliance is an evil     puts non denominational christianity at the head of daily life   look  mate  the man's books and his speeches       they encourage hatred    you've invaded a christian country   i was born in dudley   soon a fire is going to be lit   and everyone  everyone will flock to it   so     you work for laygass   we are the poor fellow soldiers  this     this is a holy war   look      islam is a peaceful religion   allah is peace   where's this going to end   with britain christian   s0 run  run   run   i'm sorry i wasn't strong enough  lord   i    i didn't start this  honestly   i didn't even think the piece of wood we found was special   you're a believer  aren't you   jack was minutes away from dying   i'm a christian  i believe god sometimes chooses to heal   excuse me   i saw you on the news   touch him   sorry   he has leukaemia   could you touch him  please   i'm not special   what harm can it do   bless you in jesus' name   thank you   you should get that thing removed   they work themselves out   viv   these are the keys to my flat   bring me some spare clothes  they're drying on the radiator   touch nothing   you've got company   oh  and you'll find a crossbow  bring that too   daniel   the other interested party   he's bought this site for three times the premium   it's his land now   why   to declare it holy ground   daniel  this site and these finds are under my jurisdiction   who the hell are we talking about    'after it  follow it  'follow the gleam '  what the hell is this   well  he won't tell me who's bought the site   i can't believe how quickly this is getting out of control   i can't believe how quickly this is getting  out of control   everyone wants a piece ofthe cross   they always have   i'm not being funny or anything    but some men with medieval swords  just broke into your flat    are you ok    yeah  i found a way out   how    through a window   here   i'd say they were looking for the wood sample     yes     it's gregory   i know who's taken over the site   edward laygass   philanthropic right wing christian   his father founded an outreach organisation   using impressionable young boys  from the orphanage   has long held a belief   that the country needs to restore the values  and principles ofthe knights templar   presumably without the burning and  whole sale murder of muslims  i assume    well    hmm   white wings  publishing and television   edward laygass announces plans to  lobby parliament   for the abolishment of non christian  religions in the uk   he's been disowned by every respectable priest  and clergyman in the country   here's a video stream from  the white wings website   britain's green and pleasant land has been  overrun by invaders from the east   so what can we do about it   do you want theirjerusalem or christ's jerusalem   hello   i've been waiting for you   thanks for coming   i think we should talk   you know  i've met muslims    good muslims driven with that same look  you have now   mad with zeal  longing to make a difference     but there is another way   and if you follow it  you'll get closer to god   don't make me go to the police   stand down from this  i don't want there  to be any trouble     you have guided my hand and given me my resolve  i entrust myself to your will   hello  nice to see you again     nice to see you    nice to see you   hello  how old are you now  nine   i believe the knights templar brought  the cross of christ to england   if they were butchered then maybe  the cross is still here   geo phys hasn't uncovered anything else   and anyway  wouldn't their attackers  have taken it   not necessarily  no   then why not let us find it   why turn a scientific enquiry into  a cecil b demille film   we are at war  dr magwilde  and our enemy is winning   god has forsaken us because we are  a nation of hypocrites   and we goto church to get married  but we don't really believe   we baptise our kids and renounce the devil  and all his ways    but really we're just counting the seconds  until we can wet the baby's head   i don't need a sermon from you   the templars had faith   my favourite bible quote  john 14 verse 2  'in my father's house are many mansions '  the most wonderful thing for me would be  to see the rooms of heaven filled   and when we find the cross itself    the christian world will rally to it   you got that nurse on television   didn't you   you want to turn this place into your  own version of lourdes   may i   be gone by the time i come back   did you break into my home  you bastard   laygass is going to twist all this  into some kind of modern day crusade   what do you want to do  gilly   let him have the site   well  you said yourself   geo phys uncovered nothing new   which means whoever killed the knights  took the cross   all we have to do is find out where  and get to it before laygass does   what have you found   a grandmontine monk was with the knights  when they were ambushed   we found his crucifix   the cross with the symbol carved into it   yeah  but he was killed along  with the other knights   his name was stephen   and this morning  i found him   a chronicle of stephen   holy brother of the grandmontine   he followed them to england   escaping the persecutions   his manuscript is vague  i don't think stephen  was considered very reliable   the rest ofthe order went out of their way  to discredit him   his full writings have been broken up   some are in the ecclesiastical library   i've sent dolly there now   but one manuscript appears to be privately owned   any ideas by whom   edward laygass   stephen's writings are in the past tense   he must have escaped the attack   he was the soul survivor of that attack   he knew what the knights were carrying  he knew what became ofthe rest ofthe cross   but if laygass has these writings    then he has all the answers   he would know where the cross was   he has some ofthe writings  not all of them   he must be missing a vital clue   you are impressed   i am because you are very clever   what  what is it   well  if  and i only say if    laygass has an army of modern day  crusaders on his side    if they had the cross   what would they do with it   now then  where art thou  brother stephen   brother stephen travelled with our knights    as recounted in his chroniculi minori   their leader was a great templar   jaques de saint omar    that sword     why do you like that sword   ben  look at it    can we stick to what we're doing  please   i know you can see it   what is it about this sword   nothing  can we      if i may resume     the knights were attacked   by saracens    they were dressed as saracens  left saracen  coins  but stephen knew differently   english mercenaries in disguise   he says they stole a 'most magnificent relic '  by which  ofcourse  he means the cross   he goes onto say  'these thieves were  in the pay of the grandmontines themselves '  why   because the templars were being wiped out   the monks couldn't trust them with the cross    so they made it look like saracens had killed  them and taken the cross back to the holy land   in fact  they would have taken it  to their monastery at creswell   creswell's been heavily excavated   nothing doing   they hid it somewhere   if the answer was in that book    laygass would be lynching heathens and parading  the cross up and down pall mall by now   where else could the monks hide it   well  laygass can only read the top soil    we know how to dig   fancy a drive  dolly  pay a visit  to brother laygass's place   i'll just put the kettle on   hi  dr magwilde  professor parton    wessex university archaeology department   we're here to collect mr laygass's notes  on the brother stephen writings   here's the book   it's wired   syria  jordan  the holy land  gundelia   good   look at us   we're so paranoid  laterally cut  why   pack everything up the finds  everything   get it in the back ofthe truck  go  go  go  go  go   we haven't got much time   there has to be a key   why do people always say that   no  there doesn't   'in my father's house there are many mansions '  it's laygass's favourite quote from the bible   my lady   'the beheaded body of a young muslim student  in the south of the city '  has sparked an outcry of anger and disgust  among religious leaders across the country   as the bishop of birmingham meets with  muslim clerics today  to discuss how     sounds like laygass's war is about to begin   no wonder laygass loves this thing   brother stephen talks about the knights templar  rising again and crushing the heathens   what are all those symbols there  the animals and stuff    pictograms   they reference different monasteries and churches    each one representing a particular place    stop   brother stephen carved this symbol  into the back of his crucifix   why would he desecrate his own holy cross   maybe it referred to a place that  was extra special for him  extra holy   where is that crucifix   well  we packed everything   viv  you cleared out the office  did you see it    i packed it i'm sure      i think   no  he carved this symbol because that's  where they were taking the cross to   the snake and the sword   the templar church at garway  herefordshire    garway   garway   what do you plan to do with the cross  in the unlikely event that we find it here   well  shall we find it first  and procrastinate later   you lost  eh   we're looking for the church   the church   it's closed  though  for drainage works   got the flagstones up  an' all sorts   nothing under there then     like what     0h  i don't know    secret chambers  anything like that   thanks  anyway   if you wanna sightsee   you can have a look at the dovecote     dovecote     built with the church   it's in my garden  come on through    best one i've seen   holy  ain't they  doves   symbol of peace     dolly     how many    and six     666   the number of the beast     funny how folk tick  isn't it   looks like they've blocked up a well mouth   are you sure   yeah   stop  hang on   do you know how to put this on   come on   ok   these are roman crosses    collected from the crusades   the templars didn't know which was christ's   so they brought them all   and the piece we found   it's from one of these   be very careful   ben  what's going on   once filled with pure white doves   now teeming with grey   sullied scavengers from abroad   ben  gregory   how do we know which one   it's all about faith  isn't it   maybe we shouldn't know   you're right  we'll take one   it'll stand as the true cross   it'll be a beacon of hope   i don't think so   come here   what the hell are you doing    you're going to help me secure a cross   you will help me  or i swear to god  this child will die   what have you done  what have you done    ben  ben   viv   i'll find you   what   you gonna let them burn     is that what jesus would do    what do you know    we know laygass brainwashed innocent children  to grow up believing they were holy warriors   your knights  do you know why they kept doves   to tax the farmers   liar  the doves are a symbol of purity   doves would take the peasants' grain    however much they took  the templars  would take the same     they are holy birds     ben   james  we can't leave them to burn down there   they'll burn anyway one day     i don't have your strength     why   because he's killed   james  you've shown us you're brave enough  to kill for the cross    now show us you're brave enough to save   come on  come to me    help me save a cross  help me   help me   kill her  kill her   it has never been about faith   it's been about power         no  i'm going down   ben   and did those feet in ancient times  walk upon england's mountains green   god gave you that voice  sister   but the devil uses it   viv   i've got you  honey   don't let go   help    help me   i called the police  anyone hurt   it's over  the cross  it's gone   you sang to him   i just thought it might buy me some time   you know what   i'm impressed   now  please  please  please    for the love of jehovah   may we go to the pub   how's your miracle patient   the remission hasn't lasted  but he got to  talk to his family one last time   that's god's gift to him   don't lose your faith  helena   it's working loose  i think i can get it   let me   god is in the quiet places and the little things   viv  can i ask you something   are you going to keep talking  like a fortune cookie   or are you going to get out there  and start digging   what's with the cheshire cat thing   i'm just      thank you
