petals will fall in the salad   looks nice  like garnish   susie  mrs mccarthy  it's like i never left st mary's   agreed   the reverend bohun asked me to bake  some of my award winning strawberry scones  so  how could i refuse   and how can i   not yet  when the guests arrive   thought i was a guest   kluski z makiem i rodzynkami  it's very popular in poland   with whom  household pets   mmm

thought you deserved it  you've been working so hard   oh  and don't get too excited   but i did tell the reverend we'd make it to his extravaganza later   oh  i've got three more jobs on   i know

strawberry scones  and i expect them to be popular as ever   'thank you  dear  you're welcome  very much appreciated '  i shudder to think what i might've seen  if i'd arrived a few minutes later   you must acknowledge that evolution renders god superfluous  at best   no  on the contrary  the majesty of life's tapestry reveals the divine   it doesn't deny it   you ought to spend some time with me in the field   watching insects devouring each other   then tell me how divine you think it is   that sounds fascinating  i love camping   tell me when and where   father brown   talking of wildlife     lady felicia  you appear to have something nesting in your hat   oh  you do tickle me  father   i hear you're entertaining us later   reverend bohun has insisted i perform my habanera   i'm sure he did   polish delicacy  award winning scone  oh  how lovely   seems my invitation got lost in the post   ecumenical harmony   warms the heart   catholics and anglicans taking tea together   pretending to be all chummy   pretending   oh  come on  father   underneath it all you think the other side's going to hell   and besides  all the pomp and bluster of catholicism   it's all a bit silly  isn't it   norman   forgive my brother   he's entitled to his opinion  as odious as it is   i  for one  find norman's candour refreshing   as refreshing as a used toilet   oh  i do beg your pardon  that was most uncouth   erm  award winning scone   you're a vulgar man   lady felicia   i may be wrong but  judging by your general demeanour  and the way you're looking at me  i'd say i'm making you randy   elizabeth  haven't seen you at mass for a while   is anything wrong   i'm sorry  father  just busy   i'm not chastising you   is there anything you want to talk about  no     everything's fine  thank you   you're supposed to be gone   i need more money   i gave you   10  you're not getting a penny more   you know how expensive is london   it'll cost you more if you stay here  i guarantee it       l'amour      l'amour      l'amour      l'amour      l'amour est enfant de boheme      il n'a jamais jamais  connu de loi      si tu ne m'aimes pas         what are you doing   come on   you forgot something  you vile  disgusting rodent   you're finished  barnes   so this is where you hide the good stuff  is it   i'm cutting you off   excuse me  father left a clause in the inheritance   it entrusts me with the purse strings  including all real estate holdings   i'm invoking it   do you think i wanted it to come to this   you're out of control   drinking  gambling  indulging your basest appetites   this is a lie  it's all there in black and white   as is this   it's not too late for you to be saved  norman   please   let us pray   is it true   oh   all right   trust you to liven up a party   poker game still on for next weekend   no of fence  but right now i don't need the fawnings of a sycophant   where's the reverend  he's going to miss his big moment  ah   oh   everything all right   i'll be fine  can't let my brother's shenanigans ruin the day   no  thank you for coming   my sincerest apologies for the fracas earlier   we won't let it spoil things   we've been blessed with beautiful weather  and in about  ten seconds we'll be blessed with the sound of glorious bells   ten  nine  eight  seven  six   five  four  three  two  one   norman  no   oh  sweet jesus   he's dead   looks like a single blow to the head   the skull's been crushed like an eggshell   fragments of bone driven through the ground and body   perhaps you should go inside   i'm not going anywhere   search for a weapon   lady felicia  did you see anyone running away from the scene   i can't  um     i just     it's all right  take your time   i was cleaning my hat   i looked out and i saw he was lying there   i    i didn't see anyone else   i'm sorry  i think i need to lie down   come on  yes   i'm going to need statements from all of you   who last saw mr bohun alive   isn't that obvious  the murderer   he attacked him less than an hour before  in front of dozens of witnesses   mr barnes   mr barnes  did you do this   he got what was coming to him   is that a confession   you don't need a confession  look at his head   who else could deliver such a blow   inspector   is this one of yours   yeah   simeon barnes  i'm arresting you  on suspicion of the murder of norman bohun   you are not obliged to say anything    wait   it was me   i did it   no  i'm sorry  reverend   that's not possible   look at her  she has neither the strength nor the brutality   mrs barnes  if you're trying to protect your husband     i stole the hammer from the forge   i crept up behind him   and    and i hit him  i swear it  its true   so help me god   elizabeth   elizabeth barnes   i'm arresting you for the murder of norman bohun   you are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so   but whatever you say will be taken down in writing  and may be given in evidence   i tried so hard to save him   i know   i can't believe elizabeth could do this   it had to be simeon   i'm fond of her  too  but we mustn't allow our emotions to blind us  to the possibility that she may be guilty   not of murder   not her  it's not in her nature   even if you're right   it doesn't necessarily follow that simeon is the culprit   trust you to look for mysteries  when the truth's right in front of your eyes   i don't so much look for mysteries  as they come looking for me   and your penchant for spy novels and crossword puzzles   that's forced upon you  is it   you may be right   but you must admit that your brother had a certain reputation   and simeon barnes is not the only person  who'll be glad that he's gone   then you admit elizabeth may be innocent   i never said otherwise   then speak to the inspector   you know him better than i do  tell him   i don't think he'll appreciate me interfering   when has that stopped you before   she says norman threatened to kill her husband   so she got to him first   can't get much more out of her than that   but she's put her name to it now   doesn't mean much if she's lying   it does to the prosecuting solicitors   bless me  father  for i have sinned   it's been one month since my last confession   i've had relations outside of marriage   twice   i thought you and simeon were happy   we were   simeon     he gambles   i found an iou note for   50   poker  we'd lose everything   the house     i tried to talk to him about it   but he told me not to worry  that he'd sort it out   typical man   so i went to norman and i begged him to waive the debt   and he agreed     on the condition that i     i'm so sorry  elizabeth   is there anything else you wish to confess   no   then you must tell the inspector   i won't see my husband hang   norman bohun had any number of enemies   well  until one of them turns up with blood on their hands   i won't say anything else   anything   you know i wish i could tell you   how about this   tap your brolly on the floor  once for yes  twice for no   you know it's not that simple   it's a woman's life   and her soul  lest we forget   inspector     were her fingerprints found on the hammer   oh  no you don't   i'm only trying to help   then quid pro quo   you see  i know a bit of latin  too   you know i can't   i thought you were a renegade   hardly  though i'm flattered you think so   then do the heroic thing and tell me what you know   then  unless you have information pertinent to this investigation   information you can actually share  don't get involved   father  which floors do you want me do first  presbytery or church   yes  why not   good morning  father  susie   i thought i'd make a start on the quarterly accounts   don't bother  he's been on moon last few days   father brown   are you all right  you had that look on your face   look   wheels turning   you don't usually get that look unless there's something amiss   there's nothing amiss  don't worry   so  you're going to the funeral   mm   do you really think mrs barnes is responsible for      why do you say that   you think that susie      if you must get it out of me   i saw susie and norman arguing shortly before he was found murdered   and when the inspector asked if anyone saw norman  before it happened  she didn't say anything   what were they arguing about  i     i don't know  i think it was about money   even so  susie's hardly the type to commit cold blooded murder   you only say that because you're so fond of her   do you think i should tell inspector valentine   not yet   i'll speak to susie myself     'after the funeral '  you all right  wilfred   i have some snacks  i'll put them out   don't trouble yourself  i'm not staying   fine   did you speak to elizabeth   yes  and   let's just say i'm investigating   always sad when so few people come to pay their respects   even for someone like norman   presumably  you don't think he was a bad sort  being his friend   maybe i'm a bad sort  father   think about that   you don't strike me as one   well  appearances and all that   why won't you admit it   your wife is in prison for a crime she didn't commit   don't talk to me about my wife   do you not fear eternity in hell   what  like your brother  you mean  the adulterer   cos that's where he is now  isn't he   fire stripping the flesh from his bones   an eternity of blistering agony  stop it   what  two pronged attack  is it   shall we go inside  reverend   do you not care about your wife   i said don't talk to me about my wife   mr barnes   you see   oh   oh  i run out of disinfector   disinfectant   i'll go shops   yes  dear   good morning   good morning   we all have our vices   i come in peace   are you following me   guilty as charged   last thing anyone wants in here is a preacher   i haven't come to preach   how about you make yourself useful   use your divine insight  tell me which one of these has his blessing   no  i couldn't possibly  oh   but if i were a betting man  i'd go for     fluffy duck  right   ten bob on fluffy duck   and i always had you down as a non believer   well  your guess is as good as any   yet that amounts to an awful lot of faith   why don't you give this one a miss  get out of my way   or   i spoke to elizabeth   i think you should  too   why's that   because you love her   after what she did   yes  even after what she did   that's what love is  isn't it   did she say anything about     why she did it   what  the infidelity  or the     both   both   you didn't kill him   no   you think she's innocent   i think you should to talk to your wife   come on  come on  come on  fluffy duck  faster   faster   get in  come on  fluffy   yes  fluffy duck  come on   come on  come on  come on  come on   'eternal passion takes it ' aw   father brown  i've been looking for you everywhere   you look in bloom   i followed susie   into a florist's   she lied to me   about what   'the next train to arrive at platform one  'is the delayed half past one train to worcester  'calling at waterloo marsh  evesham  pershore  worcester shrub hill  'and worcester foregate street '  afternoon  inspector  lovely day for it   i hear you've been doing some sleuthing   just taking care of my flock   i specifically told you not to get involved   i'm sorry  inspector  i can't hear you over this awful wind   then slow down  in fact  stop   father brown   are you ok   ticket  father  church business   susie   i used to clean his house   norman bohun   he gave me big tips   tried to make some doings with me  but i didn't let him   father   sister mary  sister margaret   is that what mrs mccarthy heard you arguing about at the party   no   the people in camp  they are really poor   some not as lucky as me to get work   they need money  i help them   how   i found out secret   told him he has to pay or i tell   you were blackmailing him   i tried   but he said   no  who would believe an immigrant    orders me to leave the village  says if i don't he'll hurt me   but someone hurt him   it wasn't me   what was the secret   last month  i arrived early to his house   he didn't hear me  i went to his bedroom     i can't say it  not to you   trust me  susie  there's not much i haven't heard in my line of work   he was with a man   i spoke to the prosecuting solicitor   he won't accept your retraction   i'm afraid i have to formally charge you with murder  i'm sorry   but she didn't do it   as far as the pro sols are concerned  she had means   motive  and opportunity   as did i and a score of other people   but she's the only one who confessed at the scene    so what happens now   you argue your case in the assizes   but if she loses  then      then i could hang   making good on my promise  promise   watching insects devour each other   sorry to disappoint you  but these caddisfly tend to  feed on nectar  and if you don't mind  i prefer to work     how many larvae do you think are in this pond   a typical mass contains up to 800 eggs    and this particular species forms webs of debris for protection  against predators   birds  frogs  spiders     survival of the fittest  eh   i spoke to susie  norman's housekeeper  i don't know what you're talking about   she told me what she saw   what are you    going to do with this information   i have no intention at all to expose you   has she told anyone else  no   how can you be sure   i know her   i'm sure   you know what could happen to me    please  mr walker  calm down  calm down   you're not the one facing the possibility of arrest  and chemical treatments  neither are you   no one else knows  no one else will  your secret is safe     i haven't come here to judge    then why     you think i did it    of course   it must be me   the deviant   it's a sad fact that many victims are killed  by the people who are supposed to love them   i did love him   he could be selfish   cruel   but he was always honest  always    who he was   like a little boy sometimes   i would never     i know  i'm sorry   thank you   did anyone else know about you and norman   i don't know   if you ever need to talk  i won't try and convert you   likewise  hm   no     have you gone mad    i don't think so   though  if i had  i suppose i wouldn't know any different   what are you doing up here   i came to reset the clock   strange you didn't do it  you're normally so fastidious   in case you haven't noticed  i've had a lot on my mind   i did notice   where did you get that   the hammer  i borrowed it from the forge   the gloves  you left up here the other day   explains why there weren't any fingerprints on the hammer   what are you talking about   i think there's something dangerous about being on high places   even to pray  don't you   looking down on the world and all the people in it   you came up here to reset the clock     but something disturbed you in your task   something you saw so enraged you     are you accusing me of     yes   i'm afraid i am   how dare you   you will tell the truth   if  afterwards  you choose to walk away without telling a soul   i won't stop you  your secret is safe with me   i give you my word on that   but you will tell the truth  here and now   you're far too tactile  father   has anyone ever told you that   the sanctity of confession   i purge myself  you let me go scot free   you're a fool   i don't mind playing the fool  if it leads me to the truth   yes  i took the hammer   my only intention was to reset the clock   poker game still on for next weekend   no of fence  but right now  i don't need the fawnings of a sycophant   what do you need   i could forgive him almost anything   lust  avarice  even murder   but not that   'and so  in a burst of pure passion   '  '  the hammer flew from my hand '  it felt so good  because i knew my hand was guided   i was but a vessel of the lord's will   his agent  it was what he wanted   how could it not be so   from up here  what's the alternative  chance  luck   there's no such thing   everything has order  everything has meaning   this was divine intervention   everything all right  i'll be fine   can't let my brother's shenanigans ruin the day   yes  my brother is dead   but it was by god's hands  not mine   i shall not repent   yes  but why the guilty conscience  i have no such thing   it's why you didn't reset the clock   because you couldn't face coming to the scene of the crime   i answer to one higher power and he will judge me righteous   righteous  using his name to justify your malice   no   your actions were yours and yours alone   look into your heart  you know it's true   thank you for the counsel  father  i'll be leaving now   you can still be saved   and so can elizabeth   is it god's will that she hangs for your crime   they'll see she's innocent   are you willing to take that chance   god will save her   god is not your scapegoat   if you have a shred of conscience left in you   you will do the right thing   you're right  father   i'm a wicked man   you can be saved if that's what you want   you've done the right thing   i'll ride with him  if i may   i owe you that much   morning  morning   lady felicia  you look positively radiant   how are your vocal chords this morning   ready to delight the congregation with my amazing grace   can't wait   good morning  good morning   susie  what you think i've done now  chopped off somebody's head   by way of an apology for thinking you were a murderer  i got one of the girls at the camp to teach me how to make it   mmm  not bad  for old english woman   irish  oh  and thank you  i suppose   if you like  i could teach you how to make  my award winning strawberry scones  hmm   ah  mrs barnes and mr barnes   ah well  don't get your hopes up  father  i'm just here for the music   you won't be disappointed   see you in there   father  i just wanted to say    no need
