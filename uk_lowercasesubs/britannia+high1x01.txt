it became abundantly clear   i was terrible   every day  i went in  determined this was gonna be the day i was gonna throw in the towel   every time i went to speak  the words just died in my mouth   then  one day  he fired me   recast me with michael ball   whatever happened to him  eh   oh  he's really famous  no  that was a joke   i just wish i'd had the nerve  to hand in my notice before being humiliated   are you gonna quit or are you gonna carry on   lauren  come on  you're late for the recording session     there is no shortcut to a dream    but i am not afraid    i'll take it all the
