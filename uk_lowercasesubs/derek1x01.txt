hey   you all right   yeah  you all right   yeah   hannah's new boyfriend  tom   he's a nice guy  we've been out for a drink   that's it   tom  you know your ship     yeah    could it beat a whale  is it big enough     well  what in a fight    yeah  if it was like       if they bumped into each other    yeah  yeah   i think we'd still survive   what's that thing the whale does when it jumps up and splatters it     with the tail flick    yeah   what  you think  could it do that to     knock it over  what about five whales   if they were working together as a team     as a gang    as a gang   if they were coordinated  five at once   if a rhino was as big as a whale  could it beat a whale   cos that's like the most powerful  isn't it   i think a rhino's smaller than a whale   yeah  i know  but if it was the same size  would it be     yeah  yeah  charging at it   yeah   and then    you know   you doing hannah  mate   what   you doing hannah  i'll take that as a yes  mate   a good call  wise choice  she doesn't put it about  so     no   nah    she's not pregnant either   i doubt there's any venereal disease  sort of banging around in her basement  so     if i'm being honest with you  mate  i'd happily do her   even if she was pregnant with venereal disease     that's very sweet of you    beggars can't be choosers  mate     these lot aren't bothering you  are they    no  no  no   derek's just been asking me every possible outcome of animals fighting  and don juan here has just told me you're not pregnant or diseased   but don't worry  even if you were  he still would   still would    the people from the council are coming in today   so i'm running around trying to make sure everything's in order   trying to stay one step ahead of the game   let's move these  mick  no money   have now   no  you can't gamble for money  the council are here   this has got to go   lesley  this has got to move  and this hoover  please   that's my favourite thing in here  apart from the people   fred the frog   where's dougie  that shouldn't be here   lesley  help me out   you can't leave a hoover in the middle of the floor   henry hoover   yeah  derek  can you pick that up for me  please   come on  theresa  help me out  ok   this area is fine   this is dougie's   lizzie  have you got your teeth in  ok   lizzie  can you just do a general check round for me   thank you  dougie     if you'd like to take a seat    right  thank you   'i dread these council visits   'i don't know what they want to see me about   'it's probably to introduce another bit of red tape  'to make my job even harder   'they don't care '  they just have to make sure that their costs come in on budget   it's not good news  hannah   you see  in the budgets for the year   obviously  we have to prioritise  and because this isn't a big home   we thought it would be easiest to re home the 20 or so residents       22    22   facilities in and around the area   i'm not re homing them   well  i can understand your reluctance  but without funding   it would be a struggle to run the home efficiently   well  it's a struggle to run it efficiently with the funding   well  exactly  i do understand   do you   well  fine  well  we'll fund the place ourselves   yeah  well  no  it's not quite that easy   you see  you still have to show that you can provide  all the necessary standards   you can't just let people live here and fend for themselves   sorry  who do you think you're talking to   why would i let people fend for themselves   no  no  hannah  all i'm saying  is that at the moment  we're assessing the situation   if we think this can be funded despite the cuts   we might be able to save the place   'i've never understood budgets when it comes to things like this '  it costs what it costs   if it costs more than some person in a suit thought it would   it doesn't mean we're overspending  it means your stupid guess was wrong   are on staff   could we streamline there   what does streamline mean   oh  just trim away the fat  that's all   they're snooping around now  trying to find ways to cut corners   good luck   oh  shit  kev   you've got to get rid of kev  council are here   get rid of him for about an hour   why an hour  he shouldn't be here full stop   just get rid of him   he's harmless enough  you know  but derek has taken a shine to him   so    if he wasn't here  he'd be dead in a skip   bullshit  mate  it is bullshit   i had to touch him   well done   he fucking stinks   where's kev   he's outside  airing   what   i've put him outside to air  he stinks

have  dougie   they just want to talk to the staff one on one  ask a few questions   they're just chatting to dougie now so     all i want to do is find out a few simple things  about what it is you actually do   i've told you  i do everything   i've got a broken cup that needs fixing   i can see   i've got a meerkat here  a solar powered meerkat from the garden   it's knackered  i'll fix that  i fixed the toaster this morning   right     pop back next week  all this will be sorted  and i'll have another pile of shit to fix   i don't know what you want from me   i'm a little bit worried about the electrics thing  dougie   if you don't have any training     it's not that hard  roger     really    yeah  it's not that hard  it's three wires  innit   well     brown  blue and sort of earth   put them in the right ones  you're away   you're making it seem like it's a massive drama   we're talking about a toaster   it was just a loose wire  i fixed it   they've got toast again  i don't know what the form is   i just see you ticking boxes   you don't have to know what the form is   it's just a few notes about what it is you do  who you are   how you fit in here   yeah  i fit in  i do fit in   well  i can see that  i can see you do a lot around here   everything  i do everything   i think we've got pretty much all we want   good   right   they're treating me like a twat   coming in here  looking at what i'm doing   they're looking for problems  the moment he walked in here   he didn't want to hear good news from me   he's looking for problems   'i reckon it causes more problems  them coming around   you know  the old ones  they find it stressful with some stranger  coming around with a suit on  eyeing everybody up and down   they don't think of that  though  do they   no  nothing's going to change at all  ok   it's fine  i won't let anything happen     they wouldn't move us      no  absolutely not   they don't want to go anywhere else  why would they   it's great here  innit  they love it   everyone gets on  we're like one big family   'and then they come in  messing it up   'the thing is  they want to find problems so they can close us down   'waste the money on something else '    a cup of tea    yes   right  then   got to find the word  wordsearch  it's bands  chico she's found     coolio we need to find next      derek   what   can you get those tadpoles out of the sink  put 'em in the pond   no  fish will eat them   can you just do it   no  because thousands would be dead   murderer    mass murderer   tadpole hitler   i'd quite like to have a look at the lunches   can you supply something for us   yeah  absolutely  we've got all the menus and everything   we try and keep a nice variety for them   and it's nutritious   of course  absolutely   it's not wee  tadpoles   hannah said put 'em in the pond while you're sneaking round   i'm not going to put them in the pond   i'll just leave them outside  and i'll put 'em in the bath   back in the bathroom when he goes   ok  putting the tadpoles outside until he goes   and then going to put 'em back in the bath   look  one's starting to get his legs   oh   he's a froglet   yes  yes   are those carers   they're volunteers  well  two of them are volunteers   one of them is on community service   really   i thought you couldn't work here if you had a criminal record   well  it's never anything bad   you know  and we can do with all the help we can get   this is theresa and lesley and mick   mick's the one doing community service   yeah   just doing a few days with us  aren't you  mick   so what did you do to land yourself in here   threw something in my neighbour's skip   see  it's never anything that bad   what  and he called the police  what did you throw in there   his wife  she was doing my fucking head in   this is jack  arthur   this is the low dependency corridor   people come and go as they please  you know   hi  annie   oh  hi   you all right   he needed a kip   yeah  just had a kip  you weren't bothered  were you   no  it didn't bother me   no  it didn't bother her  so i just     get the fuck out   bloody hell  charming  innit   god  just hold on     i was worried about  you know  little things like a cable across something  or a wobbly chair or something like that   i didn't expect them to see kev's bollocks   none of us did   once the council have been    they've been snooping round   they'll get rid of us two straight away   we're not needed  get all the old people out  no   that's what will happen   i understand we can save the house by raising money ourselves   jumble sales     it's a nice idea  derek     we can save the place can't  we    yeah  next stop is a petition   petition   enough signatures  you can hand it in officially   he does signatures   best in the business   he's got 35 000   and he's wasted an entire life getting them   yeah  how many do we need   well 100 000 and you can hand it in to parliament    yeah  but i was just speaking to linda garvey over at parkview   alzheimer's   yeah  they got saved from closure with 5 000 signatures  so in that case  you know  it worked   i mean it could all come up again   let's get signatures  then   yeah  go down hampstead high street   people love to get involved  don't they  bored housewives   how bored   what   these housewives  how bored are they  they bored sexually   are they choosy  they want a bit of twinage   a bit of piston thrusting   have you forgot the reason we're going down there   no  i haven't  mate  but i just want a bit of pudding   pudding   yeah  sex pudding   that's great   where do they want to move us  anyway   i don't know all the ins and outs  it doesn't make sense   just someone who's a bit of a jobsworth   want to change things that aren't broken   interfering   the world's full of them   this is dougie's job  i work in the centre   kev doesn't    hasn't got a job  have you  have you  kev   no   he claims    what  do you claim benefit  yeah     what do you claim it for    everything   what have you ever put into the system   i spread a lot of seed around   it's just constantly on his mind   yeah  kev said you are one of the ugliest people he's ever met  because of your hair  didn't you  kev  yeah   i'm not bothered   do something to it  hairspray it   there's no point  i know it looks stupid   people yell stuff at me all the time   the other day someone shouted   there's an egg with sideburns    water off a duck's back   as long as it's annoying you  i'm going to leave it   why does hampstead sound like  hamster    why has hamster got  ham  in it   why isn't a pig called a hamster  hamster   derek  watch what you're doing  just     kevin  will you keep your eye on him    all right  it's not my job  is it   i knows what i'm doing   holding on to a 50 year old bloke  it's weird   excuse me  will you save broad hill   she'll sign it  hello   all right  love  let's break the ice   how do you get a nun pregnant   dress her up as a choir boy   she didn't sign it either   they haven't got a clue have  they   i don't know how many signatures they've had   is it going to make any difference  really   are we really going to save the home by them two   look at 'em  the saviours of broad hill nursing home   what a mess   excuse me  do you live around here  sorry   do you live around here  yeah  can i use your toilet   sorry   'desperation  isn't it   'well  you can see that as soon as kev goes towards someone  look '  just avoiding him  i don't blame 'em   you all right  how you doing  very nice   is that your mum  yeah  i'm going to cut to the chase   i've got absolutely no chance with you unless you're  you know   a prostitute or smackhead or something   in fact  i think i do stand a chance with you  especially  if i can you a little pissed up and teary   you're meant to be getting signatures  to save the old people's home  you're chatting up women   stay away from the women  never   joanna lumley wasn't all over the gurkhas   i wouldn't mind joanna lumley all over my fucking gurkhas   absolutely fabulous  she was   pointless   try and not worry about it  you know   i'll keep talking to 'em  they said we could fund ourselves   so we're always fundraising  aren't we   so it's not a problem  and me and marge could always go on the game   the money i'd get wouldn't keep us in biscuits   it's meadway  meadway animal centre   excellent  my best day   oh  it's meadway  they bring a few pooches and moggies  for the residents to have a cuddle with   they're the local pet rescue centre   they get a bit of grant money for pet therapy so it's lovely  isn't it   yeah  yeah  we always enjoy it  and they bring the older  more docile  animals in for them and the pets get smothered with attention  and the old folks get a furry companion for the afternoon   the problem is these  lot never want to let them go  so     i loves all animals  but ivor's probably my favourite  because he's always keen and he likes that ball  right   and he brings it back  and he's got a tail like a sausage   he thinks it's a big tail  but it's not   it's just like that  like a little sausage  innit   look at his face  look at his face  look at how he loves that ball   it's the best thing what he's ever seen   oops  did you see that   hello  ivor  come here   hello  ivor   why does he fight to get the ball and then he brings it back   why doesn't he just keep the ball   because they likes chasing things  don't they   a dog is the most enthusia    enthusiastic  is that a word   the most enthusiastic thing on the planet   it just goes    if you go   do you want to do this    it goes   definitely  that's my best thing    see that  he caught it  and he brings it back  magical   best thing in the world  animals   'i wish they could keep the animals for longer because  'it's so good for the residents  particularly when they've had all  'the stress they've had with worrying about the future of the home   'i might ask if they can leave them here tonight '  excuse me   do you think it would be possible to leave the animals here  and pick them up tomorrow   they can't be left unattended  oh   someone would have to stay up with them all night   right  ok  ok   we'll get through it   we'll just do what we have to do   you have to  don't you   six months of being re homed  so     i'm not going to let that happen   this is their home   they've got every right to stay here till the end   not a lot to ask  is it   'people think care means three meals a day and a bed   'but it means caring   'and if you don't care  you shouldn't be in the job   'they deserve all the same pleasures as anyone else   'just because they're old and poor and weak  they're forgotten '  hello   look  since we last spoke i've had a look at the figures   and it probably comes as no surprise to say that we won't be able to fund  this building in the light of the current economic situation   ok  well  that's fine  we'll fund ourselves  thank you   well  not quite that simple   you see  i've still got a couple of qualms   derek  um     what exactly is his situation  he's  uh    he's different   yeah  he's different  yeah   i mean  he's the most popular  kindest  best worker  anyone here has ever met so he is different  yeah   that's not what i meant  i mean  is he  uh     is he handicapped   yeah  he's too nice for his own good   no  i meant could he be autistic   but what if the chimp had a gun  then the bear     where's a chimp going to get a gun from   i don't know  a policeman who wasn't concentrating   derek  what  can i have a word  yeah   have you ever been tested for autism   i'm no good at tests   what   would you mind seeing someone   who   well  an expert and a doctor   you don't have to   if i am tistic    what is it  autistic   au     tistic   that's what i said  tistic   if i am tistic  will i die   no  no  no  but at least we'd know   would i have to go into hospital and do experiments on me  no   so would it change me in any way  would i be the same person   yes   don't worry about it  then   i think we've covered everything  roger   i think we have  i think everything's done now  roger   i think you've got everything  ticked enough boxes   i think you've pissed everybody off since you've been here   so you could shoot off now   you got anything else to do whilst you're here   i'll just let you know  for your form   that toaster  i've given it a go  nothing wrong with it   i had lovely toast  no danger  no one died   all right    you can shoot off now  you don't know anything   you don't know that she did 68 hours last week   she's not meant to  she's meant to do 40  she did 68  and why is that   because of people like you  go   you've got nothing to do here   in fact you've probably got more to do back at the office  sorting out your expenses   your little fish pie you have at business lunches and all that   get back and sort all that out   you know i've caught you out  you're walking away again   i've caught you out  you knobhead   dougie     yeah  i know i'm fired  yeah   no  do you want a cup of tea   a cup of tea  love a cup of tea  yeah   well  i'll bring it down to you
