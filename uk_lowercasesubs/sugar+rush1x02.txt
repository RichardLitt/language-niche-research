ok  so i tried to cure myself of my obsession with sugar  by sleeping with dale the decorator   only to find my mum had got there before me   kim    so i'm a 15 year old queer virgin   such a fuckin' virgin   my mum's a whore and she's so scared i'll tell nathan  she's trying to be my best mate   who said family life was simple                                 when you're a kid  you get told a lot of shit   these are the best days of your life   course we love you   and then you get older and you think  ''now they'll level with me ''  this won't hurt   but they never do   aubergine or apple    we walk around pretending we're in a disney movie   whatever you want  my darling   when really it's a gangster porn flick   oh   kim    you've got to expect nothing     what's a rent boy    erm    they were a band   uh    in the '80s   except lies   the thing that really pisses me off is that she's totally getting away with it   dale should do your room next  kim   yeah   cool   and i just keep going along with it   that's because you're such a good liar   what colour paint do you want    stella can choose     too old    for what   a toy boy    nathan is a complete sucker   why hasn't he caught her    knock  knock   ooh  you look nice   you going somewhere special    ooh  can i have a spray   mmm   did you want something    um     just a bit worried     wondered how you were    i'm great  i'm fine  what do you expect    good  i was a bit worried     what do you want     i told you   stella  the concerned mother isn't in your nature   so just spit it out  what do you want      can i borrow your jeans     what    only if you're not wearing them  it doesn't matter if you won't   you really are priceless  aren't you      are you gonna lend me your jeans or not     why the hell should i help you meet dale    hey  what do you think   ''the world is your oyster''   or  green    don't get sad  get even     what do you mean     well     you know when donkey told darren he had me   and darren went completely bellistic  well  i thought l'd teach them both a lesson   i'm gonna shag ray the doorman   sugar's logic may be twisted  but in the end it made sense   revenge is sweet   stella was just borrowing clothes     she wants to take you bowling    bowling    wahey   we haven't done that for years  i thought you hated it   oh  we can't  we can't     it's parents' evening    parents' what     i don't believe it    oh you've not made plans  have you    no  no  of course not   what could be more important than her only daughter's education    yeah  exactly     think of all the things you could do to her    like what    like    i could sleep with your dad   ugh   so  mr and mrs daniels  it's very nice to meet you   before we get onto kim's academic records  l thought we could have a general chat   how do you think kim's settling in   fine  i think   hey  i know  we could put acid in her foundation   yeah  or     or we could put    we could put bleach in her lube   ugh   you don't think the move has been too disruptive   no  why   it's just that i can't help feeling that she's a little distracted   like something's worrying her   i'm sure kim's fine   well  you know your daughter better than me   she just doesn't seem very happy   why is my mum such a cow  shoogs   i don't know  kiz   do you think i'm a slag   what's more important    truth or love   no   course not   well  maybe you need both for it to really work     sanctimonious little bitch    we haven't done very well  have we   ignore her  what does she know about our family   kim has been very strange recently   yeah  well   think there is something wrong     like what    i don't know  i'll have to speak to her   no  l'll do it     really    mm hm     you sure    yeah     last time you did  such a huge row    nathan  i'll do it   all right   talk to our son  he's the one who's walking around with a goldfish bowl on his head   i mean  she wants us to have a ''mother and daughter day''   lt's fucking disgusting   what does she want you to do  help her pack tights   there is this fantastic new spa opened in town   massages  great lunch   and they've even got a thalassotherapy pool   you can bring sugar   that's fucking brilliant   er   no  we're meant to be shitting on her  remember   do you think i'll be able to get a brazilian  ready for ray     no    he's gonna love me     he won't be able to keep his hands off me    no   ow  oh   oh  to be those paper pants   look  l'm not going to get a rash  am l   want me to smother you in cream   for once we agreed on something   ow   ray is going to love me   lt's not about men  it's about making yourself feel good   yeah  right  you believe that   you girls these days  you're so clued up   that's because you adults are so full of shit   oh  ugh   lt's a bit sour this  innit   what do you want next  kim   how about an exfoliating massage   mmm  hot stone treatment   no  thank you   how about a colonic   if that's a cocktail  i'll have two   i almost wished i was with dad and matt   ah   that was good fun  wasn't it     dad    yeah   l'm from another planet   or maybe not   your card and receipt  madam   what's brilliant about being your age is you can do anything you want   you don't have to feel guilty   l never feel guilty   l think you are very good for my daughter   yeah  l help keep her straight     we don't want her ending up like you    mmm   l suppose she told you that     l'm not in favour at the moment   she has a go at me as well  sometimes   you can't smoke in here   kim would like to believe we're all perfect   what she doesn't realise is     once you've had two kids and you've been living with the same man for 15 years   the sex really isn't that great   kim   it was only meant to be a bit of fun  i didn't mean to upset you   why don't you come back in  mm   come on  darling   please   oh  for god's sake  what's wrong   what's wrong   moping around the place  making everyone's life a misery   i mean  nathan's worried sick   well  maybe that's your fault     it was a one off    that's very reassuring   i made a mistake   do you really believe that   cos i don't think you feel guilty at all     that's not fair    well  then finish it   please  mum   this is as much your dad's fault   it's complicated   fine   you're not going to tell him  kim   kim  kim   kim  hold up  kiz  l've got something for you   what's wrong   kizzer  what's wrong   i don't know   have a guess   no   no idea   kizzer  i'm in me heels     what's your fucking problem    you were supposed to be there for me     not to get pissed with her    lt's not my fault she had alcohol   how could you be so nice to her after you know what she's done   i thought you wanted revenge   yeah  so   i had to win her round   the shafting's always much harder when it comes from someone you love   you     payback time   for once i thought that stella was right   you know what's brilliant about being your age is you can do anything you want     and never have to feel guilty   it was the perfect crime   she won't say anything  cos if she does     i didn't mean to do it  dad  i was just so upset about stella and dale   they're having an affair   we are a beautiful  devious duo   nothing or no one can get in our way   except     if you'd like to enter your pin   sugar had thought of everything else  she knew the stuff that mattered   lf you're gonna con someone  you've got to get inside their heads     so l'm your mum  yeah    you're a tart     my life's shit    you'll sleep with anything   my kids are shit   my husband's a minger   and i ain't had an orgasm in years   is this really necessary   um     it's just these new machines   i can never quite remember   hmm     would you like me to cancel the transaction   um     then i remembered stella had changed it     i'll do it   to something she'd never forget   i'd like to say it was my birthday  but actually     it's the date she shagged simon le bon     what    oh  don't ask   god  kimmy  i thought we were dead meat   but we weren't  just like stella  we were getting away with it   and  shit  it felt great   hello   yeah  um  l'd like to order a crate of alcopops  please   yeah  the number is 3907     sugar had become my mother   what do you think her credit limit is   l think we've spent way more than she can afford already   so   she had no sense of consequences   and in the end  the only person she cared about was herself   i thought this was about me getting revenge   yeah  you get revenge  and i get    clothes  ok   and the worst thing   suppose so   i totally went along with it   it should have been a good day   love me  babe   we could er   use the card and get a hotel   if i wasn't such a sucker   it's like     if you came to my planet  you'd feel lonely   cos everyone would be like me   matt  you do know that um     er  that you were really born on earth  don't you   i just told you i wasn't   i see  er     you must know that   it's like i don't fit in   and one day    i'm gonna have to go back there   mmm   i got you something   it's for your spot   my life was one big cover up  one big lie   thanks   want a   a chip   you're right   what   you are from another planet   we didn't want to say anything because um     you see  um     i'm from a different planet  too     right  i'm gonna head    what     yeah  i'm kinda tired    oh  what about clubbing   ray the doorman  remember  he's gonna get us free drinks   yeah  well  you don't need me   well  um    will you leave us your mum's credit card  then   that was it  there were gonna be no more cover ups   you know what  i'm sick of being your lapdog   kiz   you can keep your spot cream cos i like it how it is   from now on  i was gonna tell the truth   ray would shag the homeless   which is a good thing because you look like a fucking tramp   tramp   honesty really was the best policy   put your top on   um    i was just telling dale we had to finish     such a load of bollocks    kim   you're full of shit  stella   we're home   it's an alien invasion   we had a great day  dad's from the moon  too   oh     is everything ok    mm hm   this was my chance  we were gonna talk properly for a change     all right  mate    ''all right  mate ''  have you no idea what's going on   i found them on the kitchen table and i've just found them in here   what's she talking about   they're having an affair  dad   what   she's fucking the decorator   who am i kidding   it's an alien invasion     is everything ok    mm hm   all right  mate   mum was just trying on the clothes we bought   we had a really girly day together   thanks  kim   that was very brave  what you did   i know it's not easy   hey  come on   i just want us to be a proper family   we are   like we were   i don't want you and dad to split up   that's not gonna happen   really   of course not   just so long as you don't say anything   come on   let's dry those eyes     we don't want dad to see you like this    why     well      because he might suspect     no  because he will worry    you don't give a shit     that's not true    can't mess up your romance   if you're that concerned  why don't you wear these   i wouldn't want to help screw up the lie   so there we were  a perfect family once more     one day i'm gonna visit the moon    mmm  good     you can't come    i hope your spaceship explodes     i hope your pubes turn ginger    matt   on the outside  everything made sense   wow   oh  you look great   thank you   yeah  i chose it for her   oh  it's perfect  kimmy   i know  i thought it was less tarty than the usual stuff she wears   you're very right  you two should go out together more often   you see  it has been a brilliant day   maybe i should have told the truth  told nathan that he was with the wrong woman   that she was bound to break his heart   but you can't help who you love   you still think this lady's a tramp   hold this  will you   do you wanna watch   no   and there we have it   another lie   synchronization and corrections lucile76  tracklist    making plans for nigel   nouvelle vague  swing lite alright   luke
