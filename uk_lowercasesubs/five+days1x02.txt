you've got a spare key   i could get them for you        oh  shit   my bloody dictaphone   thought you cub reporters were supposed to be doing shorthand   yeah  i can write it down in shorthand   but i can never read the sodding stuff back   my daughter got prizes for shorthand   i used to say to her   barbara   i used to say    you are a mother   why are you working all these hours    i mean  it wasn't as though  she had some brilliant career  you know   who looked after leanne   she came to me after school   it was me who put up  with her teenage tantrums  and her boyfriends and     the meaning of life   do you have any smokes   she     she used to scream blue murder  you know   leanne  when i was smoking   she made me give it up once and all   why did you start again   well  i'm not going to die young now  am l     southfields mobile home park   number 27   so was she happily married   just cutting to the chase   matt  the volume on the telly  the washing up     whether there's anything hotter than a vindaloo   yeah  the pair of us  could argue for england   recently     i'm the stepfather from hell  apparently   'cause i think tanya could use a bit more discipline   leanne's walked out on me before   and she's always come back   we've always made up   but this time   my     my little girl is out there on her own   and there's    there's nothing i can do about it   and the best they can offer is talk about standing up on the telly  and doing one of them stupid appeals   i mean  what the hell good is that gonna do   better than sitting here   yeah  she's quite pretty i suppose   but what men find attractive is a bloody mystery if you ask me     hi  danielle    oh  hi      kyle  it's kyle   anyway now she's dead  innit   and that gorgeous little girl   god  how sad is that       i've got a favor to ask you  mrs  poole   leanne's never been one to have a proper system   but i always say to her  you'll need a system  when rosie goes to school   you read about these things happening to other people  but    grandma   i've always changed all the linen on a saturday     and i still do    wasps might come in   so you're staying here now  tanya   till i can escape to my dad's   it's good for my french   and no one gives me any grief in france   barbara  matt does not give you grief  tanya   he always does his best for you   you must try not to be so ungrateful   mrs  poole  this press conference   i know it sounds nerve racking   but it's not as though you have to answer any questions   the senior investigating officer will do all that   grandma   you're freaking them out   and don't even think about knocking on their door  mic  they won't talk to you     is it murder yet    as you well know   this is a missing persons enquiry   and there's a news conference in     oh  god  look at the time   what about this line that she was over the side   leanne was having an affair   says who   foster  a  she left her handbag and her mobile in the car   b  she's drawn no money   c  she's spoken to none of her family or known associates   and d  her little girl's missing and it's all over the newspapers   which would bring any living female screaming straight home   i don't care if it's brad pitt she's shagging        barclay  come in   good piece of intelligence  thanks  we're discussing it now   just pressroom gossip really   she's not run off with a fancy man  it's ridiculous   amy  the press will always be faster than us on some things   they don't have to play by the same rules we do   they're chewing my ears off wanting to know  when you're going to launch a murder enquiry   until i've got evidence to support a murder hypothesis   leanne and rosie remain missing persons   but the public is going to want to hear that from you        they really don't appreciate it  when five year old girls get into cars with strange men   and they're going to want reassurance about their own kids   look  i've prepared a media strategy document for you   and we'll just need five minutes to rehearse your replies   performing monkey now  when i've got something to say to the press  tops   i'll be sure to let you know   no  love  it's the bosnian community worker i'm after   yes  i can hold   i took  no  for an answer yesterday  and i shouldn't have   and i'm not going to today   i know you think you've got more important things to do   ordinarily i wouldn't even disagree with you about that   but  lain  you've got no witnesses   no flower seller  no white van man  no sightings   no forensic   which means that for now   the media is bigger than the investigation   it's saturday afternoon  so it's sunday papers   at st  saviour's church hall  or we'll miss their deadlines   okay   result   well done  the lucky girl   mic  i'd buy you a pint  but i know you're a busy man   you tight old poof   ooh  the voice of modern policing   i can't call it murder    just to make your job easier    it's your call   but if i take what turns out to be the wrong line in tomorrow's paper   okay  mic  what's your preference    devil woman abandons her kids   or shazzam      perfect mom in double slaying shock    don't give up your day job  sweetie   it makes a pretty good front page for you either way   alas  the front page is reserved for the little girl  and the evil bastard pedophile kidnapper  for whom shooting is too good  blah blah blah   you should know i never comment  on speculation like that   as for this boneheaded notion  about some affair you've decided the mother was having    ahead of you on that one  am l   no  all we're getting  from everyone is hearts and flowers   so you don't want to know who the lucky bit on the side is     her ex husband     he's in france    hence my witty  and appropriate choice of song     thanks for that  you're a pal    hey     hey  swapsies      hey   bastard   bastard   afternoon     cutting it fine    famous for it   mic danes     josh fairley    pleased to meet you   i hope it's not too milky   it seems so strange  me sat here like this  with this bit of paper with words on it  and them all waiting for me in there   and i realize  i still don't believe any of this is really happening   i want you to know i don't blame matt for saying no   i don't want you to blame him either   he's a good man   i keep telling her   leanne  you don't deserve him      beam  daf parry  first husband  lives in france   he's five years older than leanne   he knocked her up while she was still at school   halfway through her  a  levels  tanya was born   which did for her education   consequently  mom and dad don't like him very much   when you spoke to him on the phone though   he said he was out doing viewings all that day from dusk till dawn   showing rich british people round their dream homes           with swimming pools     he sounded genuine enough    what  for an estate agent   yeah  for an estate agent   call him back  tell him you won't be able to get there before the press do     beam  okay    oh  jim doesn't like french food     send someone else    oi  butt out  you   guv  press officer  says it's urgent   we won't be able to get the comrog till midweek   but we can get started on everything else now   i think they're winding up now  yeah   foster  dig into his past a little bit     he's grabbed his coat   can't keep the beast waiting much longer  tops   i wonder who changed his mind   mr  wellings  thank you  thank you for coming   there'll be flashes going off and noises  and everybody looking at you  but just take no notice  okay   you'll be fine     woman  mr  wellings  please  just look over here   okay  i don't want to keep you waiting any longer   and i'm sorry that detective superintendent barclay    has been unavoidably held up    barclay's banker  the wanker   i have two members of the family here   rosie's father matt  and grandmother barbara   matt will read a prepared statement   but he will not  i repeat  not take any questions  at this time or any other time   and i would ask that you respect the family's feelings and their privacy   mr  wellings  can you confirm that your wife was pregnant when she disappeared   josh  mr  wellings   matthew     well  was she or not   tops  mrs  poole's not here to take questions   i'll make a note of your query for later   man  why not get us someone who can tell us something now   where's your senior investigating officer   i told you  detective superintendent barclay has been unavoidably detained   have you found the flower wagon yet  no   what about the driver of the white van  no   any progress of any kind you'd like to share with us  ms  topcu   could everyone just simmer down and then perhaps mrs  poole  might be able to make her statement   i can't find my glasses     there  thank you    oh   i just wanted to say  that rosie is our little angel   and that leanne was a wonderful    that leanne is a wonderful mother   i'm her mom and i know her   and i know she couldn't abandon her children   but you know what  i hope she did   i hope she did abandon them   i hope she walked away and left them alone  in that car   because every day that goes by  with no word from her is  a day closer to the moment  when we'll be sitting here  talking about the murder  of my only child     okay  ladies and gentlemen  that's it   could you turn off now  please   it's okay  i'm sorry  i'm all right now  i'm sorry  i'm sorry   mrs  poole  if i may just apologize  on behalf of my colleagues for some boorish behavior earlier       thank you      and ask you just how satisfied you are  with the standard of a police investigation  that left it to a passerby to find your grandson   you didn't tell us leanne was pregnant   that's because if she was  she didn't tell me   would it have been a problem   we can't afford it  we've got a mortgage   rosie starts school after christmas  and we need leanne to go back to work   it was all agreed between us     you didn't suspect     what is this  simone   i'm supposed to confide in you just 'cause you're black     i want to stop     i want to stop at the lay by    are you sure     please  simone    okay   excuse me  excuse me  what are you doing     what are you doing    just putting flowers down   enjoying yourselves  are you   fuck off with your flowers   you want her dead  you want my little girl dead     take your fucking flowers and fuck off    everybody stand back  please     she's not dead    move this way  thank you     thank you  give him some space    she's not     thank you      all right  just leave him     matt  get off me    sarah  people just want to help   nobody can help  we are all alone in this world   i learned that a long time ago   only when we choose to be   and i chose this in what way exactly   what do you know about what we're going through   i do know   i made a mistake about the press conference   i shouldn't have said do it   you're getting off on this  aren't you   on our pain  and i don't even know you     matt     dad     fuck off back to your own world    ethan  come back        ethan   matt  it's all right  baby  it's all right   i've written your comments down  madam  yes   and i will indeed pass them on to my superior officers   bringing out every nutter in the country  this job   shaky  these bosnians of yours   world expert  me  ask me anything   i've been talking to my mate in one of the met's dipper squads   and he's warning that our man might not be a real bosnian at all     i don't     serbs  croats   slovenes  macedonians   albanians  god knows who else   well  bosnians   it's like   well  pardon me  okay  shaky   but it's like  pakis   it's a catchall   bollocks     barclay  i had intelligence that leanne wellings might be over the side   and i took the view that i had to mount  a risk assessment immediately on the alleged lover   i now accept that putting my strictly defined investigative duties  before the public relations remit was a poor decision  ma'am   i'll sing and dance on telly  iike a good boy every day from now on   and let someone else worry about finding the missing girl     grow up  lain    i know we need the media  jenny   i know   i've got an angry 12 year old press officer who keeps telling me so   the spotlight could not be trained more fiercely on us   we're all fighting for our professional reputations here   not you  every time i look at you  you've got another bit of scrambled egg on your shoulder   you'll be chief constable by christmas    i'm talking about restructuring   one year from now this constabulary could effectively be dead and buried     and the only way to ensure our survival     is to do the best job   and to do it publicly   in this case  very very publicly   so not only do i have to solve a probable double murder  before the eyes of a critical nation   i also have the pensions of 2 1 2 thousand innocent officers resting    on my narrow shoulders    you love it  lain   all i want is to be left alone to do this my own way   you're in the wrong job   yeah   i'd think better of you  lain  if you'd just admit  you'd do anything to avoid the cameras   no   albert hall tonight  is it     bit of wagner  bit of prokofiev    oh   don't pull that face   once upon a time  you let me take you to the proms   yes  and you slept the whole way through it   oh  lain  be sure to put it in writing how you're intending  to handle the race angle   he happens to be black  that does not mean there is a race angle   yes  it does     oh  go away  leave us alone   i'll see them off  matt  don't worry   come here  girl  come on     hello    excuse me   the family aren't giving interviews   oh no  actually  i'm not a journalist   i told that p c

lightly   i will never lie to you  matt   i'll always tell you everything i can   now there may be stuff i have to keep back   stuff it's better for the investigation that you don't know   and we do have to eliminate you  and that's sometimes gonna mean  questions you don't like   actually  there's something i need to ask you now   i'm listening   how would you describe leanne's relationship  with her ex husband   long distance   there's talk she may have been having an affair   she's got three children  when's she got time to have an affair     what  with daf    well   no  absolutely not   not if he was the last man on the planet   he's a bastard  simone   i'll tell you the kind of man daf parry is   since this happened  he hasn't even phoned his daughter   he hasn't even phoned poor little tanya   just 'cause dad's a rebel   just 'cause he lives his own life   'cause it's not a rehearsal  well  that's what he says   don't look like that   i'm not looking like anything   they have different telly in france and everything   and my room's bigger   want to lick the spoon   when your mom was a little girl  she used to love raw cake mixture   that's not how you spell  strawberry    you're supposed to be retired  stop being such a teacher   okay   kyle   are you in  love       honestly  kyle  you'd think you'd be able  to carry out your own dirty dishes        lncident room  d c

yeah  she said she never said anything before  'cause his van's got no writing on the side  right   but he has been washing it  every day   and this boy  he never washes his van   ethan said the van was dirty  remember  ames   yeah  he also said it had writing on the side  dumbo   writing in the dirt        barclay  just a thought   so what are we waiting for   it might help your headlines   okay

and i know her and i know  she couldn't abandon her children     leanne always went to her granddad  you know that   it was always him she confided in   i suppose that's my fault   no  love  no   any mistakes we made   we made together   that's not true though  is it  you indulged her   you never backed me up about discipline or boyfriends or     you never let me in   maybe if we had more children   barbara on tv  i hope she did abandon them  i hope she walked away  and left them alone in that car   because every day that goes by  with no word from her is  a day closer to the moment  when we'll
