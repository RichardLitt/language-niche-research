man and he's got a bit on the side    it's a farce  marriage  a total bloody farce   hands up  all those who agree   i've seen a lot of good marriages   a lot more bad ones  though  eh   the thing is  you marry a woman you fancy  but 25 years later  she's old   you don't fancy her any more  you wouldn't harm a hair on her head   but you don't fancy her any more  you fancy younger women   younger women with firmer flesh   and you're getting old yourself   not far off 50  last ten years whizzed by  next ten years will go even quicker   death beckons  so for god's sake  live a bit   go out and

stable relationship   they have three children  a young woman of 23 years of age   very recently married with all that that implies in terms of financial  and emotional stress  and two teenage sons
