french   who lost it to the british  who lost it to the dutch   the dutch lost it back to the french   the french then handed it back to the british in the mid '70s   so  about 30 per cent of the

the welcome's been very  er     yeah  you know  and the accommodation is very    ah   a bloody splinter   oh  god  yeah  no  no  it's fine  it's fine   yeah  it does  it does a little bit  yeah  yeah  well  thank you for sending me  sir   yeah ok  yeah  er  sorry  gotta go  yeah  bye   car horn beeps all right  i'm coming   so how did a british policeman get mixed up with an aristocrat   i don't know  then what was he like   who  charlie  fun  not your typical englishman   charismatic  you know  what do you mean by a typical englishman   detective inspector richard poole  metropolitan police  oh  yes  come in   thank you  well  i was out here serving drinks to the guests   it had just gone eight o'clock   then there was a gunshot from the study   and the alarms went off  so what did you do then   well  i waited for the police to arrive   did you see this woman that night   no   come on  darleen  you've got to have something on him   because you've read his file   there's got to be some dirt   i'll take you to the bay cove   so that's it   ok  bye   his department threw a party for him when he left  oh  so he's popular   no  they threw the party after he'd gone   what's that  it's a laser tape measure   accurate to a millimetre  over 150 metres   we do have tape measures on saint marie  you know   not like this you don't  sergeant thomson   now  when di hulme's body was found  he was holding a book   a travel guide to europe  why   and this is the vase  then  that was found smashed on the night  mm hmm   when the room was locked down  could anyone else have got in  no   not until i entered the code  and it can only be opened from the outside   death was instantaneous  he was killed by a  22 bullet   shot up through the throat and straight into his skull   it could almost be suicide  couldn't it  but for two things   one  gunshot and then alarm  how did charlie shoot himself and then shut down a heavy steel door   and secondly  if it was suicide  why didn't we find a pistol   then  if it was murder     how did the murderer kill di hulme and then escape from a locked steel room   james lavender  how do you do   can you tell me exactly where you were standing when the gun went off   fortunately for me  when the gun went off  i was down here on my beach  oh  i see   your beach  little proprietorial  aren't we   well  i do own it   right  and what were you doing down here   i was down here for a touch of privacy with a special friend   a special friend who wasn't necessarily your wife  which was rather the problem   james   my wife sarah spotted us   the argument was quick  wordless  ended with a large glass of wine all over her dress   that means you were at the party when the gun went off   no  i came back down here  but my friend had gone   and how well do you know the deceased   not at all  maybe sarah invited her   sorry do we have to  er     and do you own a  22 pistol  no  i don't know the first thing about guns   wouldn't know one end from another   but you've really dressed for the caribbean  haven't you   yeah  having heard the gunshot  what did you do next   well  then the alarms went off  i didn't know what was going on  so i hid   until i saw the police arrive   i see the safe was open  how many people know the combination to open it   well  i do  of course  and my wife   that's it  just the two of you  yeah   well  did you open it that night  no   or give di hulme the combination  no   then your wife must have opened it   you'll have to ask her yourself  won't you   my  my dress was ruined  i was humiliated   i came back to the house   so this is where i was when the alarm went off   and what did you do next  i came in here to get dressed   did you invite di hulme to the party  no  didn't my husband   he says he didn't   on the day of the party  did you open the safe  no   or give di hulme the combination so he could open it  no   she's lying  isn't she   one of them must have opened the safe  but why   we've got a british policeman murdered in a rich man's panic room  with an old book clutched in his hands   a safe that's open and a vase that's smashed   as for suspects  there are only two people without an alibi   james  because he was down on his beach alone  and sarah  because she was taking a shower   not that any of this matters   it doesn't get us any closer to understanding the how   how did the murderer kill hulme and escape from a locked room  it's impossible   right  i need to see the pieces from the vase  and the book charlie was holding  but first i need to see the body  that won't be possible   what won't  seeing the body  no  none of it   the book  the body  the vase   none of it is here   what are you saying  it's in basse terre  fine  we'll get sandwiches on the way   basse terre  guadeloupe  fine   which is a completely different island   what  we don't have forensic labs and dna analysis and ballistics here   we are just a small island  so i bag the evidence from the murder  and it all gets flown to guadeloupe  then how are we supposed to solve this case   we'll get their reports  when   arrange for the vase and the book to be sent here by tomorrow   can you manage that  of course  sir   how do you get anything done on this island  beats me   it's a wonder how we get out of bed in the morning   how are we supposed to find this mystery woman   when all we've got is a photograph of the back of her head   i remember when charlie hulme first got here   trying to reorganise the whole filing system   yes  i remember that  he had that whole alphabetical thing going on   would have taken us months if i hadn't talked him out of it   i'll try in there  ok   lily  how are you getting on with the     but why does he want us to do     but that's just a waste of our time   i'll get fidel on it  ok   no luck   he wants the smashed vase and the book brought back from guadeloupe   but why  they'll have only just got there   maybe he wants to colour code them   hello   who are you   i'm detective inspector richard pool of the metropolitan police   who are you   i  erm    i am mr hulme's cleaner   you're his cleaner   well  i won't get in your way  you've got your work cut out   thank you  sir   so  are you a friend of charlie's  something like that   you're from england  right   ah  you can tell  can you  yeah   erm  what are you doing here  is it a holiday  sir   you haven't heard  have you   heard what   she sobs  and he was such a nice man   so full of life  not your typical    yes  i've heard  yeah   but who would kill him   we're pursuing a number of lines of inquiries   are you  are you staying here  sir  er  yes  apparently so   and will you be here long  i hope not   oh  do you need a cleaner   or laundry  i could always send any of your suits     no  it's fine  really  don't worry   i'll just  erm  borrow the odd item from mr hulme   they're not all clean  oh  please   you know i never thought i'd get fed up going from bar to bar talking to women   know what i'm wondering  what   maybe he'll stay  who   the new chief  hey  hey   our new boss  he's many things  and i could probably draw up a long list  but he's no chief  ok   no  you lost my suitcase  so you can find my suitcase   what do you mean you've got no record of it  i filled in the form and gave it to daphne   daphne  she was standing by the lost luggage counter when i lost my     i'll ring you back   shoo   he sniffs  where can i get a  22 calibre gun and some blank rounds   best if i don't ask  it's always best if you don't ask   so the book and vase have arrived from guadeloupe   hey  smithy  well  done  lily  good work   so this is it  the book charlie was holding when he was shot  mm hmm   what's so special about it   ah  and now the pieces from the smashed vase   yeah  yes  this is all good  i should be able to    there are still two more bags  sir   even so  a bit of glue and  er    ok  the gun is sorted   well  when you get it  bring it straight to james lavender's house   lily and i are going there now  we are  why   because it turns out lady salcombe's been lying to us   good morning  lady salcombe   please  call me sarah   then tell me  sarah  why did you lie to me   i'm sorry  you knew charlie hulme   no  i didn't  you'd been to his house before  hadn't you   i smelled a perfume on one of his towels  a perfume i'd only smelled once before in your dressing room   you shot charlie hulme   what  no  in the panic room that night    no i didn't  then you went for a shower   washing off evidence  i didn't kill charlie  you did  sarah  in cold blood   you put a gun to his throat and pulled the trigger  no  i didn't kill him  i loved him   i'd always worried that james would find out about charlie and me   but when i saw him shot dead     you think james killed him   charlie was investigating my husband  why   he said he didn't dare tell me  my life would be in danger  it was you   you gave charlie the combination to the safe  didn't you   charlie said  there was a book in the safe  and that if he could just get a hold of it   he would be able to put my husband in prison   we've seen it  it's just a guidebook  what's so special about it   apologies for interrupting  your colleagues say they're ready   dwayne  psst  dwayne  so  who is your prime suspect  sorry   well  we're having a little sweepstake  so  you know  a nod in the right direction   it's a bit of a mystery so far   we're thinking of fitting up one of the staff   listen  when i'm dressed like this  don't mess with me  ok   ok  dwayne and fidel  are you in position  yep   are you sure these are blanks  yes   did either of you hear that  you fired that gun yet   the detective inspector's going to fire again   you hear that  no  nothing   this is a  22 pistol  the same calibre as the gun that killed charlie hulme   so if dwayne and fidel can't hear me firing on a day like today   what did the guests hear on the night of the party  the gunshot that killed charlie hulme  no   any gunshot they heard must have come from a larger calibre gun  a louder gun   ah  well  if it's a louder gun you're looking for   you said you didn't own a gun  no  i said i didn't own a  22 pistol   but if it's a large gun you're after    darling   what large gun   it was my father's  his service revolver  it's been here for years   it's gone   there's a box of bullets  but the gun's disappeared    38 calibre  smith wesson rounds   yup  it's a loud gun  and now it's missing   who knew it was kept there  me  of course  and    and james   anyone else  no   so once again  it's either james or sarah   and i don't peg sarah as a murderer   are you saying women don't kill people   sir  she doesn't have an alibi for the time of the murder   she was having an affair with the deceased   she owns a gun she didn't tell us about  which now has gone missing   oh  and she turns up at the scene of the murder having showered and washed her hair    well  that at least is understandable  what   the shower  this unremitting heat  i mean  how many showers do you have a day   what's in this book worth dying for   if we could just prove the service revolver was fired that night     all right  sir   yeah  it'd mean that charlie could have been killed  before 8pm with a quiet  22 pistol   and the service revolver was only fired at 8pm to establish an apparent time of death   you need a break   let's go for a walk   where   so  tell me  what's london like   oh  er     noisy  a mess   like being in a bar fight mostly  but  er     you love it   the only place i'd live   what's a typical london experience   hmm  something that fills you with joy   tell me     er  so     walking into my local  the white hart   it's snowing  bitterly cold outside   but there's a fire roaring in the grate   the windows misty with condensation   and i've got a beer in my hand  sitting in the snug   in the chair that i sit in     and that first sip   alone   yes  but that feeling   you know of  er    belonging  knowing who you are   whatever this is  it's not that   ok  so i'll see you tomorrow  shall i   yes  yes  good idea  yeah   and  thanks again   good night   yeah  good work   er  you've been fantastic   oh  right  yes  of course  er     it's the bins   have the bin men been yet   i wondered if you could go next door  and just push my bins back onto the driveway   you know  where they normally live   oh  oh  well  if you're at work then  yeah     no  no  no  no  i quite understand   although if your wife's at home  maybe she could     no  no  yeah  of course  yeah  that would be     no  no  the bins can just stay there  on the street  until you get home   well  that's very kind of you  jeremy  thank you   give my regards to eileen    elaine   yeah  er     and  um  the girls   yeah  and don't worry about my bins next week   yeah  fingers crossed  i'll be home by then  thank you   oh  come on   so  that's a date   see you in the pool at my friend's mansion in the hills   ok  then   bye   bye bye   who was that   a friend   i've never seen her before   she's a tourist   i've been showing her around the island   is the inspector in yet   no  he found a key   looks like it's for a safety deposit box   him and lily have gone to the bank to check it out   just knock on the door when you want to be let out   so  charlie's a policeman abroad   it's not necessarily suspicious for him to have a safety deposit box   on the other hand     blank   cash  forged passports   human trafficking   it's got to be   up through the caribbean  and into the states   it's a multi million dollar trade  and it absolutely relies on corrupt officials   but how does all this tie in with james lavender   oh  well  that  sir  is easy   how come   because that is james lavender's boat   we found these in charlie hulme's safety deposit box   i want them logged and fingerprinted asap   yes  the airport   they've found your luggage  not now   dwayne   lily's getting a warrant to search james's house and yacht   i need you to give me a lift to the harbour  if you would   you do have another car  don't you   it's not just     it's just the one car  isn't it   what do you do in emergencies   i thought you'd never ask   there she is  over there   how are we going to get to it   no  no  um     we haven't got a search warrant   we have now   locked   hey  look what i've found   you all right there  sir   people smuggling  told you   hang on  you're charlie's cleaner  he didn't have a cleaner   she was in my house   dressed like that  no  dressed as a cleaner   now what    there you are   remind me to tell you the story of the tortoise and the hare sometime   what were you doing on james lavender's boat   ok  what's your relationship with james lavender   what were you doing at charlie's pretending to be a cleaner   hang on   this is you   you were at the party that night  why   is this a formal interview   no  of course not  then why are you talking to me   no  of course   i'll arrange for a duty solicitor to visit you immediately   she laughs  what's so funny   oh  no    it's just     it's 100 degrees in here and you're standing there in a suit and tie  talking about duty solicitors   i'm a british policeman   no   you're kidding me   you're there because i found you on a boat that's been used for people smuggling   give me my phone call   fidel  our friend wants her one phone call   yes  sir   right  lily  i think it's time to put the squeeze on james lavender  yes  sir   i'm not leaving until we've got it all   how the people smuggling works  who that woman is in the cells     oh  and what charlie was doing in the panic room when he was killed   why he was killed  why he was holding the book   and how  finally  how charlie was murdered   oh  no   dead  he must have shot himself   it's a  22 pistol  isn't it   just like the one that killed charlie hulme   this isn't a suicide  sir   this is a confession   james killed charlie   but someone warned him  didn't they   her one phone call   ok  so who did you phone   you are in so much trouble   sir  there's been a breakout   i'm ringing the coastguard and interpol   we need to alert the airport   how did she escape from a cell    detective inspector   can i introduce you to detective sergeant camille bordey   born in sainte marie  trained in paris   but for the last two years has been working undercover on guadeloupe   making the case against james lavender   and she's back on the island   i'm days away from an arrest  so i'd appreciate if you'd     there's an undercover officer working on the same case  and you didn't tell me   we couldn't  camille thinks a corrupt officer is helping lavender  we couldn't take the risk   it won't be me  will it   i've been in croydon for the last 13 years   and if you're looking for your corrupt copper   it was charlie hulme   how do you know that   i've got evidence linking him to trafficking and james's yacht   charlie was clearly james's right hand man   we need to arrest james lavender right now  small problem   don't tell me  there is some form we have to fill in first in triplicate   james lavender's dead   looks like suicide  either way  as far as this case goes   charlie hulme's a dead end  and now so too is james lavender   this place   sir  look  if james killed charlie and then killed himself   i can take over from here and finish the paperwork   you could be on the next plane out of here   don't  i'm imagining it now   walking out at heathrow  being cold     finally being cold again   i never thought i'd miss it  miss what   drizzle  that feeling on your face  like a wet flannel   oh  england   problem is  we may know what happened   but we still don't really know how it happened   how was charlie killed from inside a locked panic room   i need you to stay here and conclude the interviews   fidel  you're with me   yes  sir   i don't believe it   how long   you do not ever want to know how long   ok  that seems about right   this wasn't knocked over  look  here and here   it was shot from slightly above and angling downwards   now  if you go over towards the desk     let's say you're james   you think james shot charlie   at this stage  all i know is that somebody shot this vase   but  with a  22 bullet or a  38  that's the question   the whole case rather depends on us finding the answer   so  if you just hold that absolutely still   let's find out where the bullet went   you need to watch out for snakes  sir  they can be in the trees sometimes too   oh  god   i thought you were a    where have you been   i figured the tortoise would get there a whole lot quicker with a metal detector   detector crackles  detector beeps loudly  finally  proof   the bullet that shot the vase on the night of the murder was a  38   fired by a bloody loud service revolver   phone rings  oh  no  not again   yes  what  sorry   no  no  no  start again   my luggage   what do you mean it's still in heathrow   you lost it in sainte marie   eh  oh   oh  i see   no  sorry  just keep it in heathrow  please  and i'll be back    soon   in fact  i'll be on the next plane out of here   are you ok  sir   they never put my luggage on the plane   yep   yes  of course   oh   it's the heat  it's finally got the better of him   you fire the gun     should i call for an ambulance  yes  you do   of course  thank you  fidel   yes  ok  so the phone call and then     into the sea with you   brilliant  brilliant   leaving the murderer free to     commit murder   er  just loosen your tie a moment there  sir   it's very  very simple   call the ambulance   no  call the commissioner  he needs to be here for the arrest   you said it  get the commissioner here as soon as possible   but why kill him in the first place  that's the question   but then  if the bullet's not the bullet     what if      yes   how many fingers am i holding up  james lavender had a mobile phone on him when he died  get it   i'm also going to need the  22 pistol he was holding when we found his body   while you're getting them  you and me are going to have a little chat   you know  i should have realised the lessons of my luggage sooner   your luggage   my case was never loaded onto the plane at heathrow   so  when the hold was opened in sainte marie   it appeared to have disappeared   whereas in reality  it was never in there in the first place   how does that help  when the panic room was opened   we thought the killer had disappeared  but in reality  the murderer was never in there   please just tell me who killed charlie   when charlie investigated your husband  he set in motion a chain of events  that led to his murder and your husband's   on the night of the party  james found charlie in the panic room  and realised he had to kill him   the only problem being  james doesn't know his way round a gun   as he told us  so he only managed to shoot the vase   at which point  charlie does the only logical thing   and locks himself safely inside the panic room   now  james has just tried to kill a policeman  so what does he do   he goes back to his beach   where he disposed of the service revolver  before making a call   in fact  he must have made a phone call   he didn't kill charlie hulme  so who did he get to do it   you can't be sure it wasn't james   i can   james only managed to shoot a vase using your service revolver   the only gunshot that was heard on the night   don't you see what this means   we have no way of knowing when charlie was killed   because nobody heard the  22 gunshot that killed him   he could have been killed at any time on the night of the murder   so  are you saying he was killed before the panic room was shut down  haven't you worked it out yet  no   i know who the murderer is   and so do you  sergeant thompson  because it's you   you murdered charlie hulme   are you insane  no  dwayne   you quickly realised killing charlie only bought you time   isn't that right   'how did the murderer kill charlie and escape from a locked steel room '  what you needed next was a sacrificial lamb   so you put a safety deposit key in my room   knowing that i'd find it the next time i showered   i mean  how many showers do you have a day   because once i had the key   you could lead me to the safety deposit box   with all the evidence you'd planted to create links  between charlie hulme  human trafficking and james lavender   who you killed before picking up the warrant for us to search his yacht   sir  this is all lies   can you prove any of this   charlie was found shot dead inside a locked panic room   on his own  no gun nearby   if you think about it  as he's the only person inside   he must have been alive when the room was locked down   who else could have shut the door apart from him   he was the only person found in there   and if he was alive when he locked the room down     'so  everybody out and don't touch anything '  he must also have been alive when sergeant thompson opened it up   silenced gunshot  even if he was dead within seconds of her arriving on the scene   you see  this wasn't an impossible murder   it merely happened after the police arrived   isn't that so  sergeant   now  i wonder who james rang that night   having just attempted to murder a british policeman   ah  well now  here we are   because if he rang you  sergeant   that's going to be pretty incriminating  don't you think   her phone rings  hello   why did he ring you  if not to say  that charlie was going to take you both down  unless you took him out   why would i kill charlie hulme   are you saying women don't kill people   because of the book he held  which he'd got from the safe   and which was about to put you and james in prison   the book he was holding was a travel guide   but was it  sir  yes  it was   and yet  with this case  nothing has been as it seems   the gun heard on the night wasn't the gun that killed charlie   the bullet that was fired wasn't the bullet that killed charlie   so this is what i thought   what if the book charlie was holding wasn't the book charlie was holding   it's charlie hulme   imagine the book was incriminating  and you're lily   what do you do  well  you clear the crime scene  standard procedure   but then what   call an ambulance  now   everyone's seen the book in his hand  you can't remove it  so you swap it   for any book on these shelves that looks the same   the innocent book going into charlie's hands   and the incriminating book going back on the shelves   concealed amongst all these others   hidden in plain view  as it were   and what's more  i reckon i can do this in one   oh  charlie hulme's blood on this   you see   everything you'd need to prove james's involvement in human trafficking   money  dates  cargoes     how did you just do that   this is the only one with no writing down the spine   i imagine you were planning to come back some time and retrieve it   oh  your name's in here   all the way through  in fact   and  er  here's a fingerprint in charlie hulme's blood   i mean  logically  if you think about it   that's going to be quite hard to explain if it turns out to be yours   you know  i have to take my hat off to you   you had me pointing this way and that   and there were times  i must confess  when you were     dazzling   you killed two people   why   do you know how many times i've been passed over   someone sent from london to do a job i should be doing   charlie hulme  and now him   so  if i'm not good enough   why not take the money instead  and a lot of it   enough to get away from this  away from you   there's a whole world out there  you know  fidel   i don't think you'll ever leave this island again   dwayne  fidel     if you would   sure thing  chief   ay  yai yai   what if i'd trodden on you   there's no point looking at me like that  i'm off   it isn't a stitch up   really   so my super in london arranges for me to be posted here   you agree to it  and it's not a stitch up   of course not  it's just a sensible re allocation of resources   look  i'm sure the caribbean's great beach holidays and snorkelling   but i can't work here  let alone live here   has anyone noticed  there's a tree growing in my front room   i've got no luggage   ah   what   you know how your luggage was left at heathrow   your suitcase  chief   anything else   any other bombshells i should know about   of course not  no   well  maybe one   no   tell me about it   you're undercover   you blew that when you arrested me  remember   no one knows you're a copper   i do  what   if a crook like marlon knows  then everyone in the underworld will know by breakfast   i'm not a crook  all  yes  you are   can't you go back to guadeloupe  can't you go back to london   i'm trying  try harder   i can't work with her  i can't work with him   the paperwork is done  you're both staying   so  as commissioner  i'm very pleased to say   on behalf of the royal sainte marie police force   welcome to paradise   don't worry  we'll look after her   in the event of lisa's death  do you inherit her fortune   who'd kill a bride  one of this lot   surely you're not saying that any of us are under suspicion   i'm a police officer  and i want a cup of tea   you like them  very much   i've got a date   you're coming with us
