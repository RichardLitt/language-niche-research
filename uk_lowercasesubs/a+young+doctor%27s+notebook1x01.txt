leopol'd leopol'dovic would often have fifty in   would he   would he   oh    you have a marvelous stock of instruments   indeed  sir   it is all through the efforts of your predecessor       leopol'd

   you have perfect eyesight   i know but to look older   i think the boyish gait is more of problem     what    you walk like a adolecent   i do not   it lacks authority  it's not your voice   what's wrong with my     perhaps i  i need a beard like     leopold  leopoldovic   come on   it doesn't matter what you like in a operating theatre   experience     that's what counts   i can't sleep   i will just listen to that wind howl   i have missed this slater's   well  at least  no one's gonna come out here  not in this weather   you're right there  it would  have to be something very serious   and complicated   like a hernia   god i'm so sick for that lecture  i knew it would come back and haunt me   i should never have eaten that mutton  right   where is it  what do i do  what do i do   insipen   what the hell is insipen   no one ever sad anything about insipen   what else don't i know i don't know   etherial sulphate of quinine diglycolic acid  it's not important   right  no  i haven't time for this   i have a hernia to attend to   hold on   yes  i knew that   it's     sit the into a bath and put hernia back in place   easy     unless of course      what     it's a      it's a        i don't know just tell me    a strangulated hernia   did you just make that up   no it's not the easiest of operations on earth   i have to operate   a knock like that does not augur well   is that you feldsher   if it's about the atlases     come quickly doctor     what is it    there is a woman here from dulcevo   a strangulated hernia    no  her labour isn't going well   oh  thank god   ehm  no     i mean      i     uh    i'll be right there   e  ehmm      i'll be right there   i'm ruined   right  what seem to be the trouble here then     it's transverse lie    is it   is it   well  lets take a look  shall we    hello   it's umm      it's gonna be alright  not long now  when did     when did  the pain start    we just have to look at things     on the inside   yep     you know  she is not as ugly as i remember    what   pelageja   still i can't belive i actually     iodine   at least no older looking doctor   you know     i think  i might just run back to the room and have a quick look in the gynecology textbook     would that look bad    it is a little late for doderlein  don't you think   no  i don't  of course doderlein  operative of obstetrics that's it     sorry      doctor   yes   thank you     it belonged to leopold leopoldovic    of course   of course i'm sure he won't mind if you use it   he is dead   he was a lot taller than you   hello  again   and in we go   welcome  gentlemen  make sure you have a clear view   this part of the female anatomy  is most beguiling   yes  yes  come in  come in     this is one of our most dangerous      excuse me     and difficult     excuse me  gentlemen   two lives are at stake   i really might need to know this one day   so the     the midwife tells me you traveled  all the way from dulcevo     is that far    it's a small village just outside grabilovka   gra    grabilovka   it's not far from gracevka   where i got off the train  of course   so i am new to the area  i don't know where anything is   no  no  geographically of course   obviously i know a transverse lie  when i see one and     this is one  well done anna   so we have here  as i just explained   is a transverse lie which means we must perform       a podalic version    podalic version  yes  correct   a procedure whereby the fetus  is manually turned within the womb   well done  pelageja   so let's perform it  what are we waiting for     feldsher prepare the chloroform    of course   yes feldsher you    you chloroform     and anna you do    that     and yes    you    just wait there   and i will     i will go and get my cigarettes   no  no  no   damn that's what i wanted   what   there are not pictures   i mean    diagrams   there is a strong possibility of a  spontaneous rupture of the uterus   why    why    but what     why   come on  you know what these words mean     eclampsia    no   hemorrhage     fetal asphyxiation    oh god   the poor mother   and the father   and what's he gonna do   come after me that's what   he's probably built like a ox   what use will doderlein  be to me then   you're right  don't listen to doderlein    the most frequent cause of      death        they have to put that here    no  it's that mathijsen   only then the renamed dutch orthopaedic surgeon  to reset all of my broken bones   give me the book     what are you doing  i need that    no you don't   y yes  i do  come on  i don't have time for this   right   you have to go back to the others   give me the book     no    i won't jump for it  i won't demean myself     give it back    no   no  no   stop   wait   what  no   what are you doing   what     no  what     what are you   doing   god   get off     he's young    yes  i know   he's young  but he really is a doctor   he just gratuated   it's all still fresh in his mind   leopol'd    leopol'dovic     he was a very gifted and vastly experienced surgeon   he loathed the podalic version   but he did make one or two useful observations   so if you'd like to  hear what they are   yes   i mean    it wouldn't hurt   well done   well done in there   lukich did well   well you did a passable version  doctor  it was     confident   if you like     pelageya can take care of that smock for you   no  no  i don't       i don't think it's necessary    it is   you look ridiculous   it makes you look even smaller   of course   is it me     or does she have the most unusually shaped vagina   well     i     i have had a     a long     and arduous journey   honestly   i think it's perfect   thank you   it helps  definetely   perhaps he'll grow into it   right     what seems to be the trouble here   oh  it's just a carious tooth     the feldsher will be back in a  minute    nonsense   this man is obviously in pain   i'm a doctor     what are we waiting for   you can come   come here   no   come on   here it is   drink this   okay  enough  let me have a look   okay       just er       nearly finished    ehm     yes    i just have to     cigarettes   yes   i kept the poor man's tooth and jaw bone  as a reminder of the day a naive but  promising young medical student   became a doctor   too boring   too sentimental  just stick to the facts   i had not long graduated from  the imperial moscow university of medicine and dentistry   top of the class   when i was sent in the remote village of mur'ev to run a hospital   it was a long and arduous journey   it's nothing   just a old notebook   trivial rambling of a medical student   it's the first time i've seen it in years   i forgot i still have it   i'm ruined
