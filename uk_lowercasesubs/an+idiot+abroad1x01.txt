the seven wonders of the world     christ the redeemer     the taj mahal     the great pyramids     truly man's greatest achievements   but there's one man who sees them differently   if that was on my road  the council would be on it   they'd go   get that down  it's a death trap    karl pilkington   it's like a pylon   i don't know the politically correct term    moron   i think   he is a round  empty headed  chimp like  manc moron   buffoon  idiot  is that normal   and he's a friend   we've often described him as being  like   some kind of real life homer simpson   homer is small minded  petty   but  at his core  a good person   and lovable  absolutely lovable   it's like a game of jenga that's got out of hand   i can't get enough of him   is everyone gonna be wearing this   he's a typical little englander   and he doesn't like going out of his comfort zone   my bollocks are squashed   i just think that it would be amazing  to send him around the world   what we'd like to see is him experience other cultures   other peoples and see if  in any way   we can change his outlook on the world   i've been to many exotic places   i genuinely think travel broadens the mind   i want him to hate it   i want him to hate every minute of it for my own amusement   nothing is funnier  than karl in a corner being poked by a stick   i am that stick   and now i have the might of sky behind me   this is one of the funniest  most expensive practical jokes  i've ever done  and it's gonna be great   just let me go  jesus christ   sync by honeybunny  all right   yeah   i'm all right  yeah   what are we doing today   just hanging around   you look nervous  you look uneasy   i am a bit  yeah  it's not normal  is it   what  what isn't   you're asking me how me day is  in a room full of people i don't know   yeah   well  you're gonna get to know them   you're gonna get to know them really well   what  everywhere i go  these lot are coming  are they   yeah  well  they've got to  they got to film it   otherwise  you'd be by yourself   and we wouldn't see it on the telly   right  karl   i'm very jealous of your trip here  karl   to the mighty great wall of china   well  you say that  but how come i'm going  and you're not doing any   well  because  um    we're executive producers   yeah  we're busy  we've got other stuff going on   so  out of all the places   this is the place that i'm worried about most   why   just the way they live  they're different   what  chinese people   they just wreck everything   they make everything weird   that's what i'm worried about   to you  to you  i don't understand what you mean   everything    chicken  why is it orange in chinatown   just the slightest thing  the chicken is orange   anything  know what i mean  octopus   toad   he just made that one up   no  say if i go over there  i have a bit of toad   i go   do you know what  quite nice   that's nicer than chicken   yeah   it's gonna be pretty tough  to get a bit of grilled toad in this country   it could make me sort of wish for stuff  that i can no longer get ahold of   have you been listening to what he's been saying there   that he's scared to go to china  in case he gets a taste for toad   and then comes back and can't get toad   so i just wanted to check that you heard that  yeah   the way they write    the letters are weird   their alphabet's not like ours   that is like    like someone testing out a biro   everything's     there's no logic to anything that they do   there i    there is   of course there's a logic to it   the way they read a book  it's all the other way around     from back to front instead of front to back  and up and down   everything that we've done  they've gone    right  we're gonna do it weirder    that's how it comes across   well  some would say that they did it first   their civilization beat ours  by many  many hundreds of years  but  anyway     right  off you go   see you when you get back   all right  see ya    a bit gray  isn't it   is today a cloudy day  or is this pollution   it's not worth having this in hd  is it   nothing looks crisp   everything's sort of hazy   like some sort of kate bush video or something   can anyone speak english   does he want to give us a lift   english  do you want to give us a ride   okay  yeah  yeah   hi   doesn't seem to work when you smile at people   nothing  nothing  blank   so i don't know if smiling means smiling here   i mean  if they don't understand me language  and they don't understand me expressions   i don't know what i've got to communicate with   hi   nothing  nothing  i got nothing then   i don't think i've ever felt this lost   even in wales   see what i mean here  though  about things not being normal   you know  i get off a plane all sort of aching and jet lagged   i thought   i know  i'll have a massage  that'll be nice    massage  massage   hai   i'm never gonna get to where i'm going   i haven't been to bed yet  it is nice  though  to be fair   that isn't    that isn't good   ha ha   ha ha   ha ha   ha ha   hell  i mean  what    was that a massage   i don't know  or was i just being mugged   ha ha  ho   well  i'm just trying to find the hotel  that ricky and steve have sorted out for me   i'm not expecting that much  if i'm honest with you   i've got a room  pilkington   nice   it's compact  isn't it  yes   it's cozy  it feels chinesey   yeah  it is   those slippers    they're mine   mm hmm   quite chinese  aren't they   behind the cloth  you have a tv   any english   no  only chinese   okay  thanks  ta   quite like this touch   suzanne wants a fish   so i'll have to let her know that i've got a couple   i mean  that is for sort of company  isn't it   it's not    it's not some sort of appetizer  that  is it   that's handy   you know  i said the chinese always come up with inventions   they're quite futuristic with their ideas   that's all right  isn't it  little radio with headlights   i don't know when you'd need that   i mean  the whole beauty of radio is   you know  you can listen to it in the dark   i mean  if that was on the  dragons' den    you'd say   i'm out   wouldn't you   i'm just gonna go and have a wander about  i think   'cause there's nothing else to do  so i might as well   you know  at least try and see a bit of the place   mix with the locals   and  you know  that's what ricky and steve want  isn't it   they want to see how i can handle meself  with some foreigners     karl     ka     kar    ka     kar   karl   yeah   l     karl    karla    karla   karl   not  karla   just  karl    karl  oh  karl  karl  yeah   karl  karl   karl   karlo    no  no  no  no    kar   no   karl   karlo    you don't need to add     like this in your country    the  shasha be ya     shasha be ya   you look   shasha be ya     shasha be ya    shas be ya    yeah  chinese     shakespeare   shas ber    good   yeah   hamlet    it's just breaking it up a little bit    karl   yeah  yeah   i'm kar l l    kar    it's not  kar   it's  karl    yeah  it smells more chinesey  now  doesn't it   sort of sweet and sour   that's good  isn't it  it's not dead   that's dead  isn't it   are they dead  are they toads   so  i don't get it  are they alive in that bag   yeah   why aren't they legging it   he's got  like  a sainsbury's bag full of toads   he rips them out  cuts their head off   sticks them in another bin bag   i don't even know what that is   i mean  it looks like a load of condoms  in jam and water or something   i mean  it's weird how he's got it sat there  as if that's meant to tempt you in   well  the idea was  you know   that i'd nip out  get a little snack  'cause ricky and steve said   yeah  try everything out   you know  do what the locals do    but there's no way i'm eating this stuff   scorpion  sea horse  cockroach  silkworm  caterpillar   this looks like they custard creams on a stick   as well  at the end   just anything on a stick  whatever you want on a stick   i just don't understand why they're eating all this   i mean  at home  restaurants would get closed down  for having a cockroach in the kitchen   yet here  it's a starter   i didn't know it'd be like this   i didn't think it'd be this mental  really   in the food department   there's a woman over there just tucking in on a     bunch of scorpions   it's kind of like she's just having a bit of a chicken leg   not a problem  just    just shoving them in her face   she looks at it before she puts it in her mouth  like   oh  yeah  which bit will i have first   the head or the ass    i mean  as she's eating one off one stick   she's looking at the other stick   she can't get enough of them  her eyes     it's like they're doughnuts to her   she's looking at them  she's going    oh  look at that one there  that one looks nice    you see  i don't know where it stops   where's the line between food and insect   if she gets up in the morning   there's a spider in the bath  what does she do    oh  good  i'll leave the croissant for tomorrow   i'll eat that now    what's he eating   oh  god  what sort of egg is that   no  it's a fetus    inside an egg   a fetus   i don't want any   just for people watching who don't know  he's with us   you know  helping drive the bus and what have you   he seems like a normal bloke   i mean  eating a fetus   not even waiting for the thing to be born  and to live a bit and then eat it   i mean  a fetus   only been here for a bit  i'm running out of these   i got three more packets left   but  you know  the weird thing is   i'm the freak here  aren't i   everyone else is eating that  i'm eating these   i'm the odd one out   had my name done  that says  karl    could be that way  could be that way   i don't know  it's one or the other   could be that way  let's face it   i don't know  could be any way   i'm sure if you  you know    if you're chinese  and you're watching this   you know if i got it the right way up   there you go  that says  karl    i mean  i haven't got suzanne a gift yet   i could just give her this  and say   yeah  it says 'suzanne  ' that    she wouldn't know   well  i'm here to see the great wall  aren't i   you know  one of the wonders of the world   but i'm just not in the mood  honestly   i'm still knackered  i'm still jet lagged   and just    just the weirdness of china   that tires you out  too   what's all the noise out there   it's like 1 00 in the morning at home   i've got a message   all right  enjoy   do people really believe that here   i mean  are people taking kids in and saying to him    right  here's me kid   what's his future gonna be like    'cause his life is gonna be a load of shit anyway   end it  do him a favor   but then it doesn't always work like that   that's what i mean with fate   i didn't do that well at school  i left with an  e  in history   so  see  if my dad knew that  he'd go    right  get the brick   and that would be the end of it   whereas i've done all right   i've got a job  i'm paying me way in life   i have got a bit of a problem with this   a mate has sent me to have this done   i'm not happy about it  really   i sort of think i'm better off not knowing   if something bad's gonna happen   i'd prefer it just to happen without having a warning   time    time i was born   a palm pilot  i didn't expect him to have a palm pilot   quite futuristic   do you know who bruce springsteen is   he's got the same birth date as me   i don't know what you're talking about   i'm concentrating on calculating your future   all right   you have to pay attention to your health  because you've got some sort of heart problem   oh  here we go   what sort of heart problem   something to do with your heart blood vessel   it's weird  that  'cause me dad had a problem with his heart   and they say it runs in the family   so is it gonna kill me  then     mm   brilliant   but maybe we can change it   although you have some health problem   we're gonna do a ceremony for you   but you do need to write a confession  about what you did wrong   something i did wrong   something i did wrong in the past   mm   did wrong   you need to write three confessions  on those three pieces of paper   all right   when i lived in the other flat   there was a fellow who used to live in it called bruce   and he used to get his post  and i'd open it   it was his old flat   i kept getting posts for him years after he'd moved out   see  it's meant to be bad  though  isn't it   carl grimshaw    i put putty in his hair   and he had to have his head shaved   that's a bit tight  wasn't it   and he had a funny shaped head  so he looked really bad   i'll put that down   carl grimshaw for putting putty in his hair   so  i worked at this bloke's shop  called bob   i was his best paperboy   so i'd collate all me papers   get them all    get them all ready   stick them in me bag   when he wasn't looking   i'd just sort of take a mars bar  slip it up me sleeve   off we go   so  every day  seven a week for about   two years   lot of mars bars  i know that  that's why it's on here   it's always been playing on me mind  that   'cause i since found out that shop  doesn't make that much money from delivering papers   hiya   this is a healing process   now everything gonna be fine   the other two papers  one needs to be put on top of a mountain   the other one needs to be put in the sea   it will help you to cleanse your soul   again  thanks a lot   just give us a second   give us a sec   you are kidding me   you seen this   see the things  there's no doors or anything   soon as you open the door   you could just get a full view of someone   i mean  if it was here   it's more understandable  isn't it   because if you sat here   and at least people come in and you'd go   so i'm in this one    it's a bit weird to just sort of wander in and     i mean  they've made this bit   why not just finish it up with a door on it   they've done the hard bit  couple of hinges and a door   and there's no toilet paper   what do they do   do they just pull up their pants and walk off   is that what you do   i'm not here to say they should be using toilet paper   it's not right   if that's not what they do  that's not what they do   but it's just    i didn't know that   i didn't think china was gonna be like this   i thought it was gonna be more     like i said  i thought it was where they made the ipod   i think i've got the wrong place  because this ain't a place where they need an ipod   have a toilet roll first   i mean  it's weird   'cause whenever you buy stuff like that   toilet rollovers and stuff  it says  made in china    why ain't they using them  then   that's odd  isn't it   so he's got to leave the house  he's got to go    do i feel like one today    i might do  i have a bit of a dicky belly   i best get me seat   everyone who's walking past  knows he's gonna have a shit at some point today   i wouldn't like that   do you know  like  how when i go into a public toilet   you like to nip in with a coin and open the door   yeah  well  you couldn't do that here  'cause there no doors on the toilets   they were filming some stuff on the street   just  like  traffic and stuff   i said   i'm just nipping in here    walked in  was greeted by two fellas squatting   they were chefs from the place on the corner   so that's    that's reassuring   honest to god   one of them was on the phone taking an order   it was    it was really     i've never seen anything like it   i don't think i could ever get used to that   you need to have your own space when doing that   and they're just there  one's on the phone   the other one's just sort of looking 'round   yeah  oh   well  it looked like he was sort of saying    i'll have it ready in  like  about five min     oh  no  give me 10    or a  king poo  chicken   no   yeah  well  i'm seeing the great wall today  aren't i   ricky and steve just said   get down to the bus depot    where there's loads of coaches and that   which  you know    i'm not looking forward to this   pilkington  pilkington   you know  i mean  getting on a bus full of tourists  with a fella stood at the front  yapping on   you know  with loads of history facts  and just loads of stuff that you're never gonna remember   is there an english bus  english tour   do you not understand   ricky and steve just said come here   sorry  sorry   thanks a lot  hello   it's a bit of a pointless exercise  really   it's pointless   stuck in here with a daft hat on   not understanding what's going on   i mean  this woman's friendly enough   but even she's sort of blanking in and out   yeah  the fella behind me is coughing his guts up   i thought i was putting on a waterproof coat  in case it rained   i need it just for on this bus   why do they do that   there's the wall   i can't see it now anyway  so it'll be a surprise for me   how long does it take to get there   feel like i'm at the post office on o a p  day   wonder of the world   a wonder of the world   well     look at everyone  pushing and shoving   this is it  then    it was heavily restored in both the 1950s and 1980s    i didn't know that   not even old bricks   am i missing something here   so the old stuff's gone on it  really   but then it doesn't count  it shouldn't be a wonder  then   you can't just build something on it and still   you know  get all the tourists in  when it's not what it says on the tin   what i'm looking at is basically a wimpy home   you know  you can see it for miles     goes on for miles over the hills and everything   but so does the m6   do you know what i mean   you can see that for miles and you go   great    and that does a job   you can drive on that   got bears in here   what's this all about  though   it's almost like they know that the wall isn't that good    so what else can we give them    we've charged them like 7 quid to get in to see an old wall   it's not an old wall  it's from the 1980s     i've got a mate who's got some bears     yeah  yeah  stick them down at the bottom    there you are  look at him    stood up   evolution   driver's getting involved  chucking it food  'cause he's not into apple  is he   i've seen what he likes eating   if that was some sort of squid with a tumor on its head   he'd be tucking in to it   he's not into fruit   so  really  i fancy getting in there and getting a mouthful   it's the first normal food i've seen since i've been here   you have one new message   what's the point of that   yeah  just    just a bit annoyed today  'cause  you know  i thought i'd seen the great wall of china   which  being honest with you  it's not the great wall   it's an all right wall   it's the  all right  wall of china   but  you know  i thought i'd seen it   and then steve calls up with some bright idea  saying    oh  i want you to see more of it   in fact  i want you to see all of it    it's just stupid   you have one new message   are they having a laugh   this isn't the great wall  is it   you're kidding me   i mean  i like the way there's no tourists and that   but then  why would there be   this is the original wall  isn't it   or is it  i don't know  is it just badly done   this is pretty shit  isn't it   you're meant to be able to see it from the moon   aren't you  the great wall   would you want to   neil armstrong getting his binoculars out    i be seeing it from up here  buzz    jesus   and the fortune teller told me  that  you know  i had to get rid of one of me sins on a mountain   so i might as well do it whilst i'm up here   that was the one about carl grimshaw  getting putty in his hair   but  you know  it's worth doing  isn't it   if it means i'm not gonna have a heart attack   well  i've been traveling for three days   i've walked miles  and let's face it   there's only so much time you can look at anything   and the only reason i've come to this bit of the wall  is because steve said there was a little village close by   and he knows someone who's gonna sort some dinner out   ni hao  ni hao   ni hao   are you all right   he's a big lad   um     just    just    just a little  little bit   little bit  not big   uh  full   well  they seem like nice people   and i can tell that just     even though i can't speak their language and stuff   got some food for me   it's nice  but it's just a bit awkward  if there's something i don't like in it because i can't     you know  you can have     you can use your hands to say certain things   but what can you do if it's something i don't like   i can't sort of make a lie up   what is that   what is that   right  forget it   forget it   it's fucking hell  they're massive toads   yeah  it's toads in a courier bag   oh  i looked at the wrong time   i didn't really want to look  but when i turned around   it looked like she was having a wrestle with one   then i heard  like  doof  doof   so i'm guessing the toad wasn't winning   and i've been told it tastes like chicken   so i should just eat it and think    yeah  it's chicken  it's chicken   just nice chicken    why did she have to cave its head in out here   why couldn't she just do it inside somewhere and then i'd eat it   tell me after   all right  yeah  i'll    in a minute   if they knew we were coming   couldn't they have just got something normal   why didn't you say to them    now  is it all right if we bring karl around   cook him something     yeah  yeah  of course you can  yeah   what does he like to eat  does he like toad    just  surely  i know you don't know me that well   but you know me enough that     i've never said to you   do you know what   i'd love a bit of toad   i've never said that to you   you could have just nipped it in the bud there and then gone    oh  he's not a fan of that  he's not    i don't like it   they're waving me over   so this is like a murder scene  with a bit of toad's head there   oh  look at this   chicken  chicken   just a little bit 'cause i'm not very good with these   he's better than me  ah   that just looks like noodles   mmm  nice  mmm   lots of that   no  love it  love it   mmm   oh  just     just chewing   another minute   i think the baby's choking   hang on   eating toad was weird   um     i had a little bit of toad   like  uh     chicken  just chicken   this woman was forcing it to me   she was saying   no  eat it  eat it    ugh  not fun   every time i swallowed it  it was coming back up   it was like it was still alive  and the legs were still kicking itself out of my head   ugh  ugh   right  no more   what's he making  then   not a toilet door  i know that much   hello   what    what are you making   what is this   coffin   coffin   is this for someone local   this lady here   it's for this lady   she looks pretty healthy   it's better to make it now   because when you're young  you prepare those things   when you're old and you won't be able to organize it   doesn't it depress you  seeing this every day  when you leave your house   not the way it looks   i think it's a nice looking coffin  as coffins go   but i don't want to be reminded that i'm gonna die     not every day   i'm not scared of death   i'm not worried about it   all right   maybe you can help me sanding the coffin   i mean  my flat isn't big enough  to have something like this hanging around   i haven't got any outside space   so i'd have to have a parking permit for this   so i couldn't be doing this at home   but there's something good about it  because as you get older    you know  she's in her 60s     it's a nice little project  isn't it   she's got a lot  this is probably sorted out   she doesn't have to worry about that   the house is probably paid for   d you need something to do to keep you going   if you haven't got any little projects   that's when you die   so  in a way     it's just something that  when she goes to bed at night   she's got a little  to do  list in her head      coffin needs to be varnished  i'll have to sort that    'cause there's not that much else around here  is there   to keep your mind busy   look at this  he's gone off now   he's having his lunch   he left me here doing this   you have one new message   my friend  kung fu      kung fu   what do i want to see kung fu for   violent  isn't it   it's pretty impressive the way everyone's remembered the kick   it was never like this for me  school   about 25 minutes was just spent with all the kids  trying to find a pair of shorts out of lost property  'cause no one ever remembered to bring the kit   so it was more like a  trinny   susannah  than a p e  lesson  we'd all be sort of going   are these your type     do you want to wear these    i'll wear them    just everyone taking it seriously   the p e  teacher wasn't a proper p e  teacher   he did geography when he wasn't doing p e   and that's why we have a lot of fat kids   leo   how are you   welcome to shaolin  and where the origin of kung fu coming from   and you are going to see the kung fu training   this is the metal   all right   and we're going to put on our throat   if i use my finger  just have a little touch     all right  yeah  just tell me   you don't have to do that  yeah      and you will have a very big     yeah  that's     ooh ee   hyah   hyah  hyah   hyah   that's got to hurt

that's the thing   if i start wrestling with him  i don't know how strong i am   i might do some damage     by accident     'cause i don't go about punching people and stuff   so i don't know how hard i can hit   i might    i might really hurt him   see  if i'm just a proper mugger   i'm walking down the street  right   i look at you  i'm going this way  yes   hang on a minute  yeah  just get back

going on here   okay  karl  i give you a challenge   what sort of challenge   hyah   what's the other challenge   this is glass  balloon   i'm going to throw the needle from this way  to get this balloon   you're gonna throw a needle through the glass     yes      hit the balloon    yes      hole in glass  yes   so you're gonna    hey  hang on a minute  right     no way   jesus   i'm impressed with that   you want to have a try   here we go   quiet please   quiet please   sorry about that   i'm not cut out for kung fu   i know that much   that shouldn't hurt  should it   just having a cup of tea   ahh   with all these aches and pains and that   you know  ricky and steve have sorted me out  with a chinese massage  which isn't like them  now   lay down   get the socks off   this is how it starts  isn't it   you are having a laugh  come on  now   oh  my god   see that  is that normal   no  lay down   boy   all right  that's    that's hot now   that's mental   no  that's hot  that's hot   okay  now  what is she doing   what is she doing   i've seen massages on the telly   you don't normally have to have a fire extinguisher on standby  when you're having a   massage   what is this doing   this is a traditional chinese massage   but why  tell me why  though   why is this traditional chinese massage   i think it relaxes the muscles   no  it doesn't relax me  so what does it do   why is she setting fire to me   what good is it doing me   don't just stand there saying it's traditional    it's traditional  it's what they do here  it's a delicacy    what is she doing   when have gloves on fire  ever been associated with having a massage   aah  i can feel it  i can feel it   i might as well have walked in there     aah      and been greeted by edward scissorhands   right  i felt that  put it out   put it out  please   it's not a good sort of combination  that  really     having something done like that  with a woman who can't understand me   this leg's fine  tell her   this leg is great   i just want this one  and then we can go   aah  that's hot now   maybe she's just a frustrated magician or something   couldn't get a gig doing magic   ends up doing back rubs  and she's come up with an idea  with having gloves that are on fire   i    i screamed me head off  didn't i   'cause it was     and i'm not messing  either  for the cameras   'cause i don't really do that   it really hurt   what was that bleeping sound   fire alarm   i've traveled miles  haven't i   and this is the end of it  is it   i mean  i thought you meant to save the best till last   but what is this   bloody hell   well  that's where it ends  isn't it   i mean  i haven't gotten another message from steve saying    right  get your snorkel out  you still haven't seen it all    and this definitely isn't you  is it   they still got handy andy working on it   by the sounds of things   it doesn't feel like a wonder of the world     just this bit   i liked it up on the hills where nobody was   but you got a fella down there selling hot dogs   they've built a bit of a conservatory on it over there   bloke flogging photographs   and then a lot of banging   it's nonstop   i don't get it  though  how come     i mean  this isn't protecting anything  is it   'cause if the enemy was coming down there   come across there  buy a hot dog   i mean  they want to get over it   i mean  take your shoes and socks off   it's not even that deep there  you can just wander 'round it   so what is it protecting   this is my last sin that i've got to get rid of   there's an old chinese proverb  by this mao fella that says    a toad in a well   only gets to see some of the sky    and if the toad came up   he'd see more of the world    which  you know  is a bit like me  in a way   i've seen more of the world just from doing this   i don't know if it's made me a better person or not   but he's saying  if you get out of the well   you'll see the bigger picture   it's good for you   but i say it isn't   and the thing is   it's not even worth getting out and seeing more sky here  'cause of all the pollution   and definitely if you're a toad   i wouldn't get out of any hole here   'cause they'll grab you and cut your head off and eat you   sync by honeybunny
