parents are prescription junkies   between them  stella and nathan had enough narcotics to knock out an elephant   and it's not like sugar was innocent   i mean  she'd already admitted that when it came to having sex  she'd always been     too pissed to remember   so what harm a couple of pills     half an hour    well  it's me     what am i gonna do for half an hour    then you shouldn't be so

pill  that's why she hasn't told nathan   she's waiting for proof   what does the pill prove   he's had the snip   can we change the subject   cos l didn't come here to talk about your husband and kids     lt's my wedding anniversary today    congratulations   some wife   some mother   god knows what l'm doing to that kid   look  are we gonna fuck again  cos l've got half an hour left of my lunch break   and a boner the size of britain that is killing me   shit   that's it  she's gonna kill herself   she's gonna od    room service   yeah  could l get chitty  chitty gangbang  please   kim   oh  god     tom     what     you're following me    no   no  no  we    we just live in the same street   so  l was    l was wondering     if     well     there's    there's this um     l though    l thought we could     lf    lf you would    there's    there's a film   and it's on saturday   and l'm   l'm not queer   l   don't   care   come on  girl  come on   oh   vanessa   why do we always have to fall for the wrong person   it's like we're trying to make life difficult   kim   can we talk   that was it  the standard cue for one of stella's one to one chats   i've suffered a number of these in my time   there was the ''how snowy the bunny turned brown overnight''chat   kimmy     can we talk  eh   the inevitable  excruciating ''now you're a grown up''chat   there you go  it doesn't mean the end of the world  just pmt  contraception and zits   can we talk   those three little words and you were ready for anything   yeah   lt's about the sedatives  headache pills and cough medicine you've been hoarding   great   i'd been expecting     dale and l are emigrating   or     l kicked your father out  dale's moving in   and your room's becoming the showroom for a new decorating business   or even     dale and l are related   he's your brother  kim   but not this   l've been through the medicine box  and there's at least five packets of tablets missing   do you want to tell me what's happening   right   ok  there's this girl  sugar  who l really like  l suppose you could say l'm obsessed   and if l don't shag her soon  l'll explode   so l thought heavy narcotics might ease things along   right   right     they're for school    school     project    a project   domestic dangers  toxicity in the home   kim  are you ok   stella   the cab's here   is everything all right   fine   i'll be down in a minute   you're not     you wouldn't     you wouldn't do anything stupid  would you   stupid   stella   look after your brother  we won't be late   she thought i was gonna kill myself   l'm hungry   yeah  well  go get yourself something  l'm busy   of course i wasn't really gonna do it   i mean  where   how   can just invite her round   slip it into her drink when she wasn't looking   that's too much like a scene from a bad film   since when was date rape a legitimate means of seduction   i couldn't really drug sugar   could i   wine  pizza   fuck me   l need a drink     nice    mmm   nice food  nice wine   lt was great service   how was your pork   sorry   oh  god  l'm a terrible husband  aren't i   haven't even mentioned your hair   it's    it's lovely   you know     i think  i think this is gonna work   the move   right   ok  so the kids had a few problems settling in   but if they'd have gone off the rails back in london  we wouldn't even have noticed   this is much better   being here   spending time together as a family   we're    we're all right   aren't we   of course  yeah     oh  my god    kim   things hadn't turned out quite as i'd expected     hi    hi   that was quite a night   my head hurts just thinking about it   fuck me  l need a drink   l've been calling you   jesus is in trouble with the fuzz again   mum's going mental and she's doing my head in   have you got a dog   ugh   shit   next door  a rat like thing   bloody hell  kizzer  there was me thinking we're gonna have a quiet night in   bender it is  oh  and get a move on with that drink  l'm fucking gagging   ilt's not right  you know   that's twisted   i hadn't really meant to drug sugar   oh  my god   sugar   sugar  breathe   i hadn't meant to drug anyone   l mean   totally   screwed   sugar  breathe  breathe   are you on something   no   then why are your hands on my tits   i     oh  my god   kim  what's happened   and i guess the dose was pretty high for an eight year old   matt  oh  my god  matt   is he breathing   how is he   yeah  he's ok   they pumped his stomach and there's no permanent damage   nathan reckons he was trying to do himself in   shit   matt thought the pills were space food   i suppose i could have told sugar  but then i wouldn't have got quite so close to her tits   it's all right   i don't understand  i thought he was doing so well   it's always kim that's been the worry   night     night  kim    night  kim   i felt terrible  you've no idea how much it takes it out of you   contemplating date rape  discovering your mother thinks you're suicidal   and almost murdering your brother  all in the course of one evening   to think that he could have     i've been so stupid   nate   i've been going on about how much better things are   and how the move has really helped things and     christ   just look at us   come on   i don't even know what's going on in the lives of my own family   we'll talk to someone   we'll get help   still  at least stella and nathan were talking   it's like there's been a total breakdown in communication   an inability to understand each other's needs   it's like we don't really know each other any more   he's always been such an easy child   and how would you describe the state of your relationship     it's fine    it's wonderful  yeah   albeit through a third party   so i nearly killed my brother   but fuck  he killed his hamster  i mean  how twisted is that   and anyway  every cloud has a silver lining   tell them you're staying at mine   it will do them good to get you out of their hair for a little while   yeah   i got to stay with sugar   for a whole night   where shall i     in here   we're top to tailing  unless you want the floor   my mum tried to kill herself   when dad pissed off   what was your brother thinking   i mean  he's just a fucking kid   ow     slag    bitch   l hope you washed your feet   what are they   sleeping pills   i can't crash
