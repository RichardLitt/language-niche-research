34 and lives in york  she works part time in a local bakery   she has been corresponding via the internet with people from all over the world   she refers to them as her global family   her latest pen pal  however  has proved to be something special   although they have never met  elaine is about to travel alone to america   where they intend to marry    how long will you be away   just over a week  but even that's caused a few disruptions   i've asked my friend jackie to cover my line dancing classes  she's not qualified to teach   but  erm   she and her husband rex were regional champions '98  '99   plus she's got boots with lights in the heel  which will give her some status within the group   jeremiah wainwright iii   that's his full title   but the title the media have given him is   the cleaver  that's right  unfortunately  a few small minded people have called him that   jeremiah can't come to england  can he   he'll never be able to visit you in your bakery because he's in texas on death row     if you want to call it death row    what would you call it   no  yes  it's death row     so tell me about jeremiah    what can i say   he is a beautiful  beautiful person    people call him a cold blooded serial killer   i know  tanya  and believe me  there is hope for those people   you say you've fallen in love with this man  but how do you condone mass murder   life is a journey  and sometimes we make a wrong turning   i know i have in the past   does that make me a bad person   he abducted  tortured and murdered eight people   you don't know him like i know him  nobody does   he also ate two of them   have you never done anything you regret   i've never eaten anyone   so far   look  i do realise this isn't the typical way that two people meet and fall in love   but y'know  sometimes things happen in life that nobody can explain   i mean some people really can't believe it's not butter   elaine  let's be honest  the man's a criminal   he's more than that  he's a cannibal  he's a dangerous lunatic   a serial killer who's been put on trial  found guilty   and is now incarcerated in a dirty  lonely prison cell  waiting to be put to death   you're making it all sound a bit negative  tanya   there's always too many ready to judge   when people hear about jerry's chosen path  they can't wait to jump on the bandwagon   ''oh  you're marrying a cannibal  oh  he ate two people ''  no  he didn't  he ate a bit of one of them when he was a student   which is a time when most of us are experimenting with something new   i know for a fact my cousin once tried hashish   and you honestly think he's capable of love   not before   that's because up until he had met me  nobody had ever shown him love   i taught jerry how to love himselt   as danny kaye once said  ''you can't love the world until you've settled for yourselt ''  or as my dad used to say  ''the man who can give himselt a hug every day  ''truly has the arms of a gibbon ''  but   yeah   today i am elaine figgis   tomorrow i shall be mrs jeremiah wainwright iii   it's been a long wait   it hasn't always been easy  but it's definitely been worth it   true love will conquer all   the question people will be thinking is ''will you have any conjugal rights during your visit ''  no  penitentiary regulations don't allow for that sort of thing   but in a way  it doesn't really matter   obviously  our relationship has never been based on anything physical   you could say it's been a meeting of minds more than anything else   plus for 24 hours a day  he has to wear a muzzle  so   no   i'm looking for a broken window service  someone reliable   you won't find anyone reliable who goes around breaking windows     i need someone to replace some windows    oh  i don't know of anyone   my cousin once got rid of an old sofa for me but he lives in leeds   no  i need a professional   like a hit man     a professional window replacement service    oh  i am sorry     you mean like a glazier    yeah  exactly   there's a company that does same day installations and repairs called heart of glass   they're in this shopping centre   they're in this shopping centre    are they     sorry  i thought you just said they were    i don't think so   they're based near my cousin in leeds   i don't know of a glass company in the shopping centre     is there anything else i could help you with    yes  i also need a blind specialist   somebody who fits and supplies blinds  no  we don't have one   did you get my piccalilli  you didn't bother  did you  nah   i asked you to get a little jar  that's all i wanted  i don't want a bucketload of it  do i   just a little bit to have with me boiled bacon 'cause it goes on lovely   it's tangy  but  no  you didn't bother  did you  too much trouble  was it   i didn't think it was too much to ask  but no  too much trouble  innit  eh   too much trouble for you  innit  eh   too much trouble for you     i'll get it now    what  i don't want it now   don't you bring it up here now  don't you bring it in this house   you do  i'll tip it in the fucking bin   i'd choke on it   no  no  it's too late now   no  too fucking  now   no  no   go on  piss

tomorrow  yeah   that's it   leave me on me own        agh     i once met a man with a sense of adventure    he was dressed to thrill wherever he went    he said  ''let's make love on a mountain top    ''under the stars on a big  hard rock''    i said  ''in these shoes     ''i don't think soi''    downloaded from
