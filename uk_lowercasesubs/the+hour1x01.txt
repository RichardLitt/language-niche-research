admit in public    you wrote that   actually  mark twain did  but    damn   tilt your head   pinch the bridge   i'm sorry   it's only a handkerchief   you see it  don't you  freddie   you always have

broadcasting house   one moment  please    i said 8 30   don't mix single malt with martini   oh  wonderful   frederick lyon for the director of programmes  of course   i've brought the manifesto   that was written years ago  when we were very drunk   you were drunk   i was sober   you've put three ts in topicality    thank you   freddie     think i should start with the marx quote   freddie  you really need to focus  no  you're right   don't want to scare them off straight away   not when one is looking to run     it doesn't have a name yet   this changing face of television news programme with no name   i'd pitch on balancing london news with the provinces   it's important they know you're interested in stories in bradford  manchester  leeds     why   because you need to show them     show them what   that you're familiar with the demands of home affairs   that's your job   you need to keep your options open   moneypenny  your eyes look piggy when you lie   i'm the producer   the new programme  clarence wants me to be the producer   lift pings  girls giggle  right   you produce  i'll present   lift pings bel  freddie  there you are   now  breathe  freddie    clarence   he's waiting but he has a packed day  later   we speak in full sentences  we listen   we don't try any funnies  yes  right   your reputation goes before you  the good  i have been able to confirm   the bad was youthful recklessness  which in your more mature years   you have left behind  clarence  i can     freddie  this is my programme   it's very important that i get the right team  and that you are part of it   ditch the manifesto   bel told me   top button    remarkable   there   there     ballsed it  top of the frame  bloody boom   how do we run that   i want two men at lord's next week to film jim laker   one to hold the camera  the other to keep the bloody boom out of sight   you play  yes   no   do i need to   i like football   which team   derby county  my mother was born     so  not really   you're something to do with natural history   heard a rumour they're setting up a unit somewhere in the bbc   i'm a big fan of animals   clarence tells me you're a brilliant journalist   give me tomorrow's news   well  a lot can happen in 24 hours   eisenhower looks like he'll run for another term  but that's obvious   i'm more interested in the underdog   rumour has it that the young mr kennedy is a contender  for the vice presidential democratic nomination   but in newsreels  we don't do scoops   let me guess  accounts   researcher  you're flying out with a crew to the amazon  monday   something like that   do you take sugar   that's a pretty blouse   so  60 minutes  six days to get it together   seventh day it's out there  three slots  tell me how it looks   at the top  new commonwealth immigration   every year from the colonies  but what does that really mean   martin luther king gives a public address in san francisco   the birth of the new negro  one who is not crippled by fear and self loathing   but driven by dignity and destiny   but we don't even challenge the fact that in every hotel window  we still  without shame  say  no coloureds  no irish    second story  macmillan and the credit squeeze  obviously   and third   it's a good story   you've got a boom tracking in every shot   seeing him cross that finishing line's the thing  it makes it more real   seeing the boom  it's the mechanics of how we bear witness  because that's what we do   what one tries to do  reveal fleeting moments of history   not with apology  not as it is now  endless static newsreel   a man who never leaves his desk delivering the story  as if it's the dry  five minute warm up act to hancock's half hour   we all want to be entertained  but while we're all busy laughing   russia's aligning its missiles and declaring world war three   it has to be the hour that you can't miss   the hour you have to see   putting real journalists in front of the camera  is sending out the message that you take the news seriously   so you see yourself in front of the camera  mr lyon   i never understand women and magazines   they only ever buy them for the pictures   you're so right  and those things called novels  impossible   so many words     this is where i ask you for a drink   sorry  i have to pack for south america   is this some kind of joke   home affairs   house of lords garden parties and outbreaks of foot and mouth in keswick   the audacity to even think you could present this programme  he asked for my opinion   and you gave it  including telling him to stuff it   i said talk to him  calm him down   i said he's a risk    he's always a bloody risk   but you said no  you don't lead the story   the story leads you  freddie  first rule of news  hmm   well  maybe you are better off where you are  two minutes   you're not in accounts  are you   no  mr lyon  i am a big fan of your work   how  exactly   i mean which bit  of my work   freddie   mr madden  my apologies  this is miss rowley   yes  i know exactly who miss rowley is   may i introduce you to the face of our new programme   if you'd like to come this way   christ  he's charming as well   freddie     lift pings  how could you do that   how could you not warn me what i was being interviewed for   if you listened    i thought it was so sweet you wanted to meet me beforehand   it's still home affairs  you're still part of the team   and it's the team clarence believes in   what  you  me and gregory peck  what is he  oxford educated   well  at least you're with your own kind   oh  of course  you find him attractive   you're pathetic   it's you who said you were calcifying in newsreels   do you seriously want to die there  the last job i got you   you nearly closed us down   you accused the then minister of trade of accepting bribes   he had  he was   clarence has championed you since day one   he was giving you an opportunity  and you have just thrown it back in his face   you could be even more brilliant than you know  but you just have to ruin it   a new programme  a new era   and they want me as producer   they're humouring you   they don't want a woman  a woman is difficult  hysterical   and you can never really find one who will ever stay   a couple more years  you'll probably want a baby  oh  don't speak   it's what they're thinking  anything else is just your vanity making you believe     what   that i can do it  that i can actually do this   watch me   oh  lyon  george wants to bump the vice presidential nominations for the duke of edinburgh     not guilty  mr wengrow is on royal duty  well  he does look very smart on his horse   copy in by four  ladies and gentlemen   oh  a doctor's been seen arriving at downing street  apparently eden's unwell again   well  you know where rumour gets us  and cairo  i'm covering the bobsleigh at bergen and then i'm     what to you is rumour  to the rest of the world is foresight  george   have you done your copy for the elms' engagement yet  mr lyon  not remotely   you know i have any number of men who would happily fill your post  mr lyon   is that a threat   four o'clock  no eden  no cairo   don't sulk  spoils your face   they could have at least offered me foreign affairs   already taken   you   traitor  i want my desk back   as i recall  i won this desk   you've got absolutely no poker face   mr lyon  there's a lady to see you  she said you're old friends   nice coat   mother hates it  i wear it to annoy her   one needs to find tiny acts of rebellion where one can   is this a joke   that's funny  most people think i'm too serious   but i find it very serious indeed  the world   you have grown up  oh  don't patronise me   why didn't you ever reply to my letters   it didn't matter   i've kept up with what you're doing  read your odd articles   that makes you quite unique   i even found the short story you wrote in the listener   which  i may add  was not very good   though i suppose the novel is perhaps still the last domain of the free mind   where they can't tell you what to think  what to say   that and art  i suppose   they  who are they  what are you talking about   they   they are everywhere   here in this building  out in the street  in your office   they even control what you write   have you heard of peter darrall   he is     he was one of the leading political minds this country had   he was killed last night   it will be reported in the evening papers as a robbery   it wasn't   there will be no investigation   even those who loved him the most will be told to forget him   they will weave a web of deceitful lies   you think it's ridiculous   i wish it were   i want you to find out why he was murdered   go to the police  i'm not the right person  yes  you are   you think you live in a democracy   you think this country stands for freedom of speech   it does not   no  i'll make my own way out   they will kill me if they know i'm talking to you   a man  stabbed  north london    came in this morning   did anyone see it  peter  his name was peter something   did he forgive you  who   mr lyon  you really should have told him  you know   he's a big boy   you found one another  douglas is on his way   all right  charlie  here you are  no   suspected robbery  came in last night   baby cries  you been frightening babies   plain clothes were in an hour ago   alexis storm will be heading the foreign desk  she covered the     spanish civil war in madrid  broke the news in '40  that the british troops had arrived in france   she has an extensive network of stringers all through europe  the middle east and africa   i'm presuming that you've resolved the home desk   there are a number of faces in the frame  clarence  we'll have the claret   i realise that freddie wasn't at his best this morning   you don't need him  he is passionate   he's dangerous   there's that very nice chap in that sunday news review  he might be an idea   no  freddie is infuriating and outspoken   but he sees the extraordinary in the ordinary   i truly believe we need him   i need him  to make the programme the best that it can be   and what is that   the world that freddie sees   a train crash  a labour strike   freddie will be somewhere away from all the other journalists   talking to the last person that should matter   but that is the story that matters most to ordinary people   he finds them   douglas   clarence  i hope you ordered for me  please   how many men   five   mi5   box 850  governor says   sis   you know you're someone when mi6 come to pay their respects   did they do this   someone's looking for something   there's   15 in here  wasn't much of a robbery   unless they stole his last cigarette   five minutes  we're done   yes  we're done   laughter  mccain's in   one of eden's press minions   christ  he's coming over   leave it to me   so  this is how westminster feeds you  hmm   clarence  what a gathering we have here  and mr madden   yes   er    oh  miss rowley  you did that lovely piece   at home with lady eden    my friends so enjoyed that   is prime minister eden in good health   yes  he is  thank you  only i heard he'd been unwell again   such maternal instincts  i do think you're rather wasted in news   i was hoping to see you today   michael was very keen to have a word   pandit nehru is coming to town   barton's been on the phone banging on at me for weeks about having an interview    no   i said   sorry  bbc has first dibs    yes  are we celebrating   we're launching a topical news programme   oh  good  marvellous  yes  um  does it have a name yet   oh  working on it   mr madden will present it  clarence at the helm  and miss rowley as the producer  that must have been a surprise   what a coup  miss rowley   douglas  i must introduce your team to     it's the mackintosh   you left it on the table   thank you  how about a brandy to celebrate   well  i'd love to  but     beyond that door women are not allowed   what is it about you men   you always need a tiny corner where we can't quite reach you   then we'll have to take you elsewhere   come on  i'm good at smuggling contraband   this is highly illegal   that's what makes it so much more enjoyable   how can you bear that man talking to you like that   we'd be foolish to make an enemy of anyone close to government  mr madden   hector   hero of troy   father with pretensions of a scholar   and mother   oh  she died  when i was ten   i've been out long enough   some of us have work to do   so it's true what they say   you work twice as hard as any man and none is half as good as you   i enjoy the company of men   is it true you covered mccarthy's lincoln day speech   with a tape recorder that didn't work   well  i don't believe you're prepared to give up this job for mr lyon   i think you'll do whatever it takes   take the afternoon off   you'll be out by the end of the week anyway   i hope you're not going to be this lax when i'm your producer   talk to mr lyon   i intend to  he doesn't listen to anyone but himself   this shouldn't be open  they told me it was going to be kept locked  they   i have an appointment with mr darrall   oh  professor darrall sadly passed away last night   oh  i'm so sorry   you knew him   no  but i hoped to   if you'd like to talk to the bursar    was he married   professor darrall  er  no  i don't believe so   tragic   apparently it was a robbery   you've spoken to the police   well  i'm sure it will be in the afternoon press   all right  sir   um  do you recognise this man  he works near here   yeah  came in last night  just as i was closing up   he didn't have no change  i told him he could pay me tomorrow   but he insisted i take this as security   it seemed a bit much for a packet of smokes   the thing is that he didn't come back   orchids  you should talk to your banker   they really are an awful cliche   george   george   you know i'm leaving  don't you   what   if i'm about to lose two of my best journalists then i'm entitled to feel a little sore   you're a big girl  bel  so i'll tell you this for nothing   i know  because there are no secrets in this place   you'll have your strings yanked like the rest of us   no  george  you'll see   there you are  georgie   an eminent professor is found with his throat cut  and it's reported as a robbery  no inquest  no search for suspects   every seam in his suit has been cut  mi6 visited the mortuary   missed your slot  programme's been filled   when does mi6 visit the body of a robbery victim   they won't even answer my questions  why should they  they're mi6   what  and we should never challenge that   he still had his wallet and his watch   give me another 24 hours and i know i can follow it up  george   though i share your desire to live in the pages of an ian fleming novel  mr lyon   i prefer to keep my life separate from a work of fiction   no  this is happening now  right now  outside this building   down on those streets  and we are doing a disservice to the public to deny it   you won't run this  but you'll run footage of ruth elms smiling at her engagement   no  the film blew  the bobsleigh   also gone   eddie thinks there's something wrong with the machine  for god's sake   have you had a single original thought in your life   do you want to die knowing you were always a yes man   if you'll excuse me  i have a news programme to get out   do you know more people watch the sooty show than us  george   you're sacked   accepted   freddie   buzz off  moneypenny   it is true  i am asking myself why i am doing this   especially as it is you who should be apologising to me   but that's what you do when you believe in someone  you let me go in there   i should have told you  i'm sorry   but home affairs is    not presenter  not good enough   but most of all not here  don't you want to get out   who else is going to have you   you know some nice girl needs to rescue you  who   there's only ever been you   and you're not even that nice   all right  you sit here  pulling apart some stupid cigarette case  when next week you could be    before  it was an offer i declined   now  it's a pity post  which i just can't   won't  no  and don't ask again  because  quite frankly   it's getting very tedious  your inability to stand on your own two feet   but then i suppose one should expect that from you   i mean  for all your strong talk  moneypenny   you really are quite hopeless  aren't you   you want to be  oh  so independent  but you just can't quite cut it alone   why else do you throw yourself at such unavailable men   bravo   phone rings  yes   'yes '  nothing  they've reported nothing   i'm sorry  but     you were stupid to ask me to help you  'and i was even more stupid to think that i could '  are you still there   'ruthie '  never give up  freddie  never   'if it's something you truly care about  believe in   'then you have to keep kicking back   'let the rest of them give up if they must   'but if that is being a grown up   '  i'd rather stay 21 forever   ruthie   operator  'sir  could you please hang up '  could you tell me where this call is being made from  please   'the claringdon hotel  sir '  bel and i are leaving in five minutes   stop being such a coward   when i was in france  there were these men   i'd    i'd loosely call them journalists  but they were never at the front   they never stuck their head above the parapet   they were terrified of being shot   yet they wrote some of the best battle reportage i've ever read     filched most of it from us and what they didn't know  they'd make up   but you're not one of them  and you'll never truly know  freddie   unless you stick your neck out and get yourself a bit muddy   come on  jump  i dare you   coming for a drink  already drunk   but i don't smoke   save it for later   i wondered if you could have a look at this  mr lyon   i'd really appreciate your opinion    the tradition of freedom of the city of london dates back to   the 13th century when it attracted privileges including   being allowed to go about the city with a drawn sword    did george ask you to write this  yes   it's very  um     it's very  um    nice and clear   it's    it's boring   yes   i thought so   you forgot your lamp   it's just a piece of tat i picked up somewhere   april  1952  your birthday  i bought it from john lewis   a yellow desk light  just what every girl needs  isaac  in   what are you doing   i thought we'd come along for the ride   douglas has invited us for drinks at lime grove studios  goody   children  there will be tears   tv chatters  thank you   shall we leave our things over here   i think that will be all right   what  falling at the first hurdle   you can do this job standing on your head  moneypenny   and don't let anyone tell you otherwise   not me  not george  not your stupid bloody banker   you're the best man for the job  and you know it   is that your idea of an apology   after i gave you that lamp  we ate at that terrible chinese   it's an angle poise because you press your face too close to the page when you read  and there's never enough light   you won't wear glasses because you say your nose is too small  and with glasses you'd look like a mole     which you don't    wouldn't     they'd suit you  you'd look just as     fairly beautiful as you are   it's yellow because you said no one wants a yellow lamp   so i thought if i got if for you in yellow then no one would steal it from your desk   i do give these things quite a lot of consideration  you see     the devil is in the detail   and what you said about my story     you're right  george will never run it   an academic  seemingly eminent  has his throat slit in a suburban street   who wants to hear that  it shouldn't stop me   that's why i am pulling apart a cigarette case  i want to hear you say it   i get first choice of desk  and i want an office with a window   and an assistant   i'll absolutely need an assistant   and i won't do the farming slots   and   may i accept the offer that i so     rudely   so rudely declined   the hour   it'll never run   mr lyon  mr madden   looking forward to working with you  at least that makes one of us   thank you  thank you   welcome on board  comrade   general chatter music plays  help us out  have a look  see

of thing   yes  she said you were witty   she's easy to make laugh   so tell me about yourself  mr lyon   no   isaac   isaac  the cigarette     the cigarette that i     bingo   music drowns speech  how did you know i like them   all beautiful women like orchids   do they really fall for that line   is it bad   very bad   darling  there you are   well  somebody obviously did   that's your
