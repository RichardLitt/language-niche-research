special talent   mine is being able to write  produce  direct  act  paint     other people are good plumbers  that's their gift   when i wrote  directed and starred in darkplace back in the 1980s   television was up cack alley  and the inside of my head was its only ticket out   this show could have changed the world   but they cancelled it for a re run of who's the boss   they were scared of my script's radical predictions   i portended that by 2040  the world would see its first female mechanic   who knows  she might even do a decent job  i wish her the very best   still  so much for possibilite   french for possibilities   tonight  i take no small amount of pleasure  in bringing you this forgotten episode of darkplace   with interviews from my publisher  dean learner   who was there at its creation and didn't die or offend me   take this gift  sit back and enjoy  what still points the way forward for humanity   love  loyalty  sacrifice  and extrasensory perceptive telepathic psychokinetic powers   voici  you're welcome    'i'm garth marenghi   author  dream weaver  visionary  plus actor   'you are about to enter the world of my imagination   'you are entering my darkplace '  cheesy '80s synthesiser music  darkplace  darkplace  darkplace  darkplace  darkplace  darkplacel   it's always the same    have you ordered chicken    yes  yes  of course i have    how long have you been here    three hours    try the fish   how long is it going to take the so called chef to cook this chicken   sorry  i'm not really this bad tempered  i'm just really peckish   i should be thanking you for looking after me   no problem   first days can be a real pain in the ass   who's that  he has a special aura around him   that's dr rick dagless md  the world famous gp   he's a brilliant yet troubled man and i'm privileged to know him  i'll introduce you     the doctors want their chicken    it'll be ready in five minutes   what's going on with that chicken     five more minutes   do you know what's going on     the word is it'll be five minutes    i'll believe that when i see it   have you met the temp   i've not got time to shoot the shit   why don't you and your new boyfriend bring me some chicken   hey  are you all right     no  i mean    yes  i deserved that   where's this flipping chicken   who said that     was it you  missy  i said five minutes    but     but nothing  women like you are the reason the chicken's late in the first place    goddamn son of a bitch  this is great chicken  getting nothing but flak    when's the chicken   the chicken's ready when i say it's ready   don't know why i'm cooking  i'm so angry  seasoning   what do i need   tarragon  oregano  never heard of it   italian seasoning  too vague    sage    son of a bitch   if i had to call myself anything  and i hate labels  i'd say imaginer   i call garth the orson welles of horror   and not just because of his weight   he's a titan of terror   i call him that as well   there are rebels and there are innovators   i'm a rebel  i play a rebel brain expert  who's in rebelliance against conventional logic  the world order   the show is about rebelliance   and if that's not being an innovator  i don't know what is   'my name is dr rick dagless  md   'i hadn't been getting much sleep lately  not that darkplace lets you get much sleep   'the pillows are like cardboard and my duvet's all lumpy   'got the call   chef down and it can't wait till morning   'poor guy   ladle to the head and a fork where a fork don't fit   'this damned evil place was getting crazier by the day '  morning  all  cheer up  liz  how's chef   guy's got a fork through his kernel   he's gonna make it   just  but the chicken's off   men laugh  that's a shame  i was looking forward to the chicken   it seems we have a mystery attacker in darkplace   i suggest we split up    you guys and the temp can search the wards   me and liz will search this office   me and sanch don't need a third wheel   this temp was a personal recommendation of won ton's   he wouldn't run if his ass was on fire   he goes with you  and that's a deal breaker   fine  if he makes administrative errors  i'll bust his hump     at least you're not going with liz    that's true   now get out of here   god  i wish i was hitting the wards with those young bucks   but i'm old  tired  spent  busted   stuck in a mouldy old office with just a moody woman for company   liz  that bulb's gone again  could you fish another one out   all of us have untapped potential   that's what the garth marenghi foundation is about    harnessing psychokinetic abilities in underprivileged kids   we've got the full backing of the army  we've already got a child who's very intuitive   i've seen garth bend a fork  so he knows what he's talking about   i mean we all have abilities   i once learned how to hypnotise women   but with that power must come responsibility   did you attack the chef  thanks for your time   did you attack the chef  thanks for your time   did you attack the chef  thanks for your time   i'll say one thing  he's very thorough   all this started to happen when the temp arrived   android   i haven't seen him eat anything today and it's 1 pm now so     what shall we do   just keep 'em peeled  we might need to kill him   uh huh  bye   good gravy  a bunch of objects flying of their own accord in e wing   and apparently more objects are heading this way    goodbye   flying objects  it beggars belief    we asked everyone if they're the attacker and they all said no    so that's why we're searching the hospital basement    exactly   ping   dead   we're too late  looks like our man struck again   negative   this ain't a fresh kill  it don't look like a kill at all   guy probably came down  got lost  went mad   ate his hands and died right here   come on  there's nothing we can do for him   keep close  these tunnels are really long and curving   hissing  hug the wall   aargh     what is it    cordless iron  friggin' smarts as well   of course   that's why these are not conventional attacks      reed   jim  in here  quick     tell dag  it's liz    ok  i'll get help   and hurry   aaaaagh   aaaa ha haaaagh   get me dr rick dagless   aaah haa haaaagh   aaaaagh   no    'y ou again  you bastard '  hissing  'what the  '  'life of its    '  'damn thing's come alive in my hand '  'suck on that '  whoa   gunshots  'escaped it '  'filing cabinet '  in times of conflict  when you're up against an aggressor   be he human  be he inhuman   whoe'er he be  often he's both   you're running on adrenaline and that's what you have to capture in the mise en scene   and then you add to that the supernatural element   an eagle eyed viewer might see the wires   a pedant might see the wires   but if you're looking at wires   you're ignoring the story   if you go to a puppet show  you can see the wires   but it's about the puppets  not the string   if you go to punch and judy to watch the wires  you're a freak   yeah  it's me  dag  i've been cornered by some cutlery   i think i can take them   a whisk  a tin opener and a spatula   i'll take the whisk out first and hold them off as long as i can   ah  i'm hit  i'm down  yeah  got me in the leg   they'll be after you next  bye   let's do this   it's just you and me now  kiddo   phone rings  hello  dr rick dagless speaking  how may i help you     bye   that was jim  he said liz is the source of the telekinetic activity   she's pinned reed against the wall and is propelling objects around   he added that i should hot tail it up there  which means going back to where we started     you stay here    but rick     no buts  there's a lot of clerical work ahead of you   don't blow it all by getting killed   cheesy '80s synthesiser music  there's a lot of slow motion  the episodes were running up to eight minutes under   the only way to stretch them out  was with slow motion   and we tried to keep the slow motion away from the dialogue as much as possible   anything without dialogue was considered for slow motion   'i ran the only way i knew how  by placing one leg in front of the other in quick succession   'i had to help reed  trapped in his office by a desk he could no longer trust   'i had to help sanchez  locked in primal struggle 'twixt man and whisk   'and i had to help the temp who was probably doing some filing or data entry   'i pressed on  chased by a stapler with my name on it  this was unbelievable   'liz was turning my own stationery against me     'w hat would she throw at us next  '   in god's name     'as i rounded the corner  i felt muscular and compact  like corned beef   'irony of irony  all this paper meant more paperwork   'look at that  liz has even struck the kiddie wing   'lf only there was a foundation to harness kids' psychokinetic powers   'this sorry madam was about to get a double dose of darkplace dagless medicine '  liz  hide your shame   aaaargh   argh argh argh   argh argh argh   argh ugh     agh    rick   argh argh argh   heartbeats  argh   argh   argh  argh   argh   no   all scream  i wanna say  you did a heck of a thing back there   i'm sorry i busted your balls   i wouldn't have had it any other way     what's your name  son    clive     strange name for an american    i'm from bermuda   oh  a british principality     it's a dependent territory    what's that   the queen appoints a governor  but she's still de facto sovereign   we had so much to teach each other   i'm gonna miss you  clive   i'm gonna miss the banter which has fizzed from the get go   and as i say  i'm gonna miss your balls   i       what    i     i can't hear you   i was supposed to file this   i'll get liz to do it first thing   under the circumstances  it's the least she can do   chokes  don't you dare die   splutters  no   he wails  silent  i owe you all an apology  sanch       yes  liz    thanks for the lobotomy   not a problem   though extracting psychokinetic ability is in its infancy   i guess being told i couldn't get a chicken supper was the last straw   it was unprofessional and girlish  it won't happen again   buns   i've seen a couple i fancy   i baked them by way of apology   so ends a chapter in a book i fear has yet to close  right  dag   i just can't believe the temp is dead   it's all right  rick  we'll get another one   it's not that  i guess i liked the kid  reminded me of me at that age   i was wild  full of ideas  knuckle to knuckle with authority   real jimmy dean  guess we were two peas punching it out in the same pod   i just hope he realised how much he taught me  that it weren't just one way traffic   i'm sure if he'd had any breath left in his body   he'd have used it to thank you   well  you'd hope   come on  dag  what say i buy us all a drink down the drip   i'd like that  i could use a drink   as long as it's not a screwdriver   yes  i'd prefer a beer   dear me   oh  dear     hee hee hee     'we'd seen a new side to liz   'hell hath no fury like a woman scorned   'they can get upset at the slightest thing    'forgetting to acknowledge them in front of one's friends   'br insisting on splitting a restaurant bill  even though that's only fair   'i'd have to try and change   'tomorrow i'd tell her she'd lost weight  or her hair looked nice   'whichever seemed more plausible '  i think what this episode shows is that the human spirit cannot be overcome   as a writer  if you take away my paper  i would write on my heart   if you took away my ink  i'd write on the wind   it wouldn't be an ideal way to work    'garth marenghi's darkplace is a garth marenghi production  'in association with dean learner '
