walk along here  no safety barriers   it's a coastal path  people know to be careful   it's a death trap   how's it going  well  from what we've got up here  sir   it looks like the rock fall around the body was faked   what do you mean  the angle of the body was wrong   it was too arranged   and up here there's no flattened grass or slippage   no loose rocks  no fibres  no hand marks   no sense of a downward trajectory  you mean he didn't fall   could he have jumped   that's unlikely  sir  given where he was found and the trajectory off the cliffs   see  not danny   if you ask me    someone tried to make it look like an accident   i don't think he was up here   get on to the pathologist  tell him to hurry up   even if it is just preliminary   ds miller  who's that   just keep walking  ellie   he seems to know you  auntie ellie   i told you  don't do that  olly stevens  broadchurch echo   i was down at the other end  why has the beach been closed   no statements now   i heard there

this is my first  you can't make it better  don't try   you don't know how i work  most likely premise is abduction   was he taken  if so  who by   watch them  every movement   if anything doesn't make sense you tell me   ok   don't look at me like that   morning   morning   i'm detective inspector alec hardy and you know ds miller   why don't you take a seat  we need to talk about something  yeah   sit down  get a chair   don't worry  i can do it   the body of a young boy was found    it's danny  isn't it   i saw his shoes  plenty of kids have those shoes   sorry  you talk   we believe it's danny's body   who is it  ellie  was it him   hey   hey   hey  it's all right   hey  hey  hey  hey   was it an accident  did he fall  we don't know yet   can you think why he might have been up on the cliffs last night or this morning   he wouldn't have been  well  he obviously was   he didn't have any reason to be   how was danny over the past few days   he didn't kill himself if that's what you're suggesting   he's been just    normal   he wouldn't kill himself  he knows he can talk to us about anything   and you last saw him when   i looked in on him er     about nine o'clock last night   he was laid in bed reading   anyone see danny this morning   no  he was up and out before anyone else  he's got a paper round   but he didn't turn up for that  jack  i spoke to him   he runs the paper shop   any signs of forced entry or disturbance round the house   no  nothing   i wanna see the body   you might be wrong about it being him   so  i wanna be sure  i wanna see   how many times you done this  ell  i haven't   thanks a lot   mark  all right  buddy  all right  trev   what you in here for  nothing serious  i hope   nah  sign this petition  will you   they're threatening to close this place down  in a bit of a rush   oh  come on  won't take two seconds  it's important   ah  good man  hey  coming to skittles  the lion on tuesday   the yetminster  grudge match  i don't know  mate   see how it goes  eh  right  give my love to beth and the kids   all this way i thought it wouldn't be him   my danny   can i touch him  ell   why him  eh  ell   he's only little  isn't he  he's just     he's just my little boy  isn't he   listen  boy   er     i'm    i'm sorry that i er     that i wasn't there for you and er     you're    you're my     you're my boy  danny  and i let you down   i'm so  so sorry   i love you zillions  superstar   i always will   was danny latimer abducted  did someone gain access to the house   if so  how   if it wasn't forced entry  who has the key   we need to collect any cctv from a mile radius around the house   miller   family  who are they and where were they   beth had chloe  their eldest daughter  when she was 15   mark was 17   mum and daughter were at home watching telly   they say they didn't leave the house until school next morning   dad was out on an emergency call out  he's a plumber   he got in around three  neither parent thought to check on danny   gran lives nearby  she was in all evening  the other gran lives in wales   until we're ready all of this remains confidential   no gossip  do you understand   all right  go on   given the nature of this case  it makes sense to hand it on to another lead officer   no   it's nothing to do with your ability  we don't want sandbrook to become a thing   i was completely exonerated  alec  you came down here to lie low   i came to do whatever the job requires   but in terms of public perception  you may be vulnerable   i'm giving you the chance to step back  nobody will blame you   this happened a stone's throw from your station   i've met your team  no one's as qualified as me   sandbrook doesn't make me vulnerable  it makes me the best man for the job   you wanna stop me  you're welcome to try   thanks for the 99   what did jenkinson want  jenkinson   the chief super  i saw you walking with her  no   i did  you were having 99s  miller  your son went to school with danny   does he know yet  no   you need to talk to him  tomorrow  i'll tell him tonight   and  sir  do you mind not calling me miller   why  i don't really like the surname thing   i prefer ellie  ellie   ellie  no   jack  we need to ask you a few questions   danny didn't turn up for his round this morning   i assumed he was sick  did he often miss his round   they all do  one time or another   how was danny yesterday  no different from usual   you didn't notice anything on his mind   he was only in here 15 minutes first thing  i'm no psychiatrist   are you married  no   are you   they brought him in here  mark and beth   three days old  he was   it's not right   what do you have  superficial cuts and bruises to the face   traces of domestic cleaning fluid on the skin   cause of death was asphyxiation   he was strangled   bruising to the neck and windpipe and at the top of the spine   the pattern of bruises suggest large hands   i'd suggest er    male   it erm    it would have been brutal   the angle suggests he would have been facing his attacker   er    he would have known   any sexual violence  mercifully  no   the time of death   er  i'd put it between 10pm thursday night and 4am friday morning   thank you   we don't get these around here   make sure you find them   we have some preliminary findings   we are treating danny's death as suspicious   oh   we think he may have been killed   i should have checked on him before i went to bed   if i'd checked    beth  this is not your fault   whatever happened  this is not down to you   i promise     we will find the person responsible   oh  my god   you have my word   he's a little boy   chlo  i don't know what to say   i know   it doesn't feel real   are the police round   come on  let's go  i want to do this   seriously   what did they ask you   do they know about us  cos you ain't  nobody knows  let's go   are you ok   i'll be better once i've eaten something   do you want anything   no   do

  oh  um  hi   i saw you broke the story about danny latimer   i'm down here after a hotel recommendation   oh  right  ok  where are you at the moment  the beach   i see people have started leaving flowers   danny's sister left one of his toys down there  it must have started it   um  ok  so your best option is the traders hotel   it's opposite our offices on the high street   becca runs it  tell her you know us  she'll give you a good rate   great  thanks   i'll maybe see you around  yeah  i hope so  yeah   i mean  that would     who are you putting up at the traders  no one  a girl  woman   oh  a woman   i'm off to the media briefing at the school  good luck   not that you    i know   different suit   press conference in 10 minutes   look at this  cctv from town centre last night   is that danny   it matches his clothes  height  it looks like his skateboard  he wasn't abducted   he snuck out   why  where was he going  who was he meeting   and where's his skateboard  yeah   i was checking through the list of belongings recovered from danny's body and at home  and there's no mobile phone   he definitely had one  he and tom  my son  had the same model  virtually identical   it isn't there  no   check with the family   good   i'm going to hand over now to our senior investigating officer di alec hardy   what advice do you have for people in the town  particularly parents   the crime rate in this area is one of the lowest in the country   this is a terrible anomaly   we are in the early moments of what might be a complex investigation   danny's life touched many people and we'll be looking at all those connections   if you or someone you know has any information   has noticed anything unusual   please come forward now   um  i'd urge everyone  don't hide anything     because we will find out   if a member of your family or a friend or a neighbour  has been behaving differently in the past days or weeks   please tell the police immediately   there will be no hiding place for danny's killer   we will catch whoever did this
