mileometer from the roswell spaceship   that's a bit of slitheen  that's a slitheen's arm    it's been stuffed   ah  look at you   what is it   an old friend of mine   well  enemy   the stuff of nightmares  reduced to an exhibit   i'm getting old  is that where the signal's coming from   nah  it's stone dead  the signal's alive   something's reaching out   calling for help   alarms buzz and bleep  if someone's collecting aliens  that makes you exhibit a   'attention all personnel  bad wolf 1 descending  bad wolf 1 descending '  on behalf of all of us  i wanna wish you a very happy

quite the expert   as are you   who exactly are you   i'm the doctor  and who are you  like you don't know  we're hidden away with the most valuable collection  of extraterrestrial artefacts in the world   and you just stumbled in by mistake  pretty much sums me up  yeah  question is  how did you get in   little cat burglar accomplice   quite a collector yourself   she's rather pretty   she's gonna smack you if you keep calling her  she   she's english  too   hey  little lord fauntleroy  got you a girlfriend  this is mr henry van statten   and who's he when he's at home  mr van statten owns the internet   don't be stupid  no one owns the internet  let's just keep the world thinking that  right  kids   so you're an expert in everything  except the things in your museum   what you don't understand  you lock up  you claim greater knowledge  i don't claim   i know how good i am  yet i captured you right next to the cage   what were you doing down there   you tell me  the cage contains my one living specimen   what's that  like you don't know  show me  you wanna see it   blimey  you can smell the testosterone   goddard  inform the cage we're heading down   you  english  look after the girl   go and canoodle or spoon or whatever it is you british do   and you  doctor with no name   come and see my pet   we've tried everything   the creature has shielded itself  but there's definite signs of life inside   inside  inside what  welcome back  sir   i've had to take the power down   the metaltron is resting  metaltron   thought of it myself  good  isn't it   although i'd much prefer to find out its real name   here  you'd better put these on   the last guy that touched it       burst into flames   i won't touch it  then   go ahead  doctor   impress me   don't open that door until we get a result   door slams  look  i'm sorry about this  mr van statten might think he's clever   but never mind him  i've come to help  i'm the doctor   mechanical  voice  doc     tor       impossible   the doctor   exterminate  exterminate   let me out  exterminate   sir  it's going to kill him  it's talking   you are an enemy of the daleks   you must be destroyed   it's not working   fantastic   oh  fantastic   powerless  look at you   the great space dustbin  how does it feel   keep back  what for   what are you gonna do to me   if you can't kill   then what are you good for  dalek   what's the point of you   you're nothing   what the hell are you here for   i am     waiting for orders   what does that mean  i am a soldier   i was bred to receive orders   well  you're never gonna get any  not ever   i demand orders   they're never gonna come  your race is dead  you all burnt   all of you  ten million ships on fire   the  entire dalek race wiped out  in one second   you lie   i watched it happen  i made it happen   you destroyed us   music swells  i had no choice   and what of the time lords   dead   they burnt with you   the end of the last great time war   everyone lost   and the coward survived   oh  and i caught your little signal    help me   poor little thing   but there's no one else coming cos there's no one else left   i am alone in the universe   yep   so are you   we are the same   we're not the same  i'm not       no  wait   maybe we are   you're right  yeah  ok  you've got a point   cos i know what to do   i know what should happen   i know what you deserve   exterminate   dalek screams have pity   why should i  you never did   get him out   help me   i saved your life  now talk to me  godammit  talk to me   you've got to destroy it   the last in the universe   and now i know your name   da lek   speak to me  dalek   i am henry van statten   now recognise me   make it talk again  simmons   whatever it takes   sorry about the mess   mr van statten sort of lets me do my own thing   so long as i deliver the goods   what do you think that is   a lump of metal  yeah   yeah  but i think      well  i'm almost certain  it's from the hull of a spacecraft   the thing is  it's all true  everything the united nations tries to keep quiet   spacecraft  aliens  visitors to earth   they really exist   that's amazing  i know it sounds incredible   but i honestly believe the whole universe is just teeming with life   i'm gobsmacked  yeah   and you do what  sit here and catalogue it  best job in the world   imagine if you could get out there   travel amongst the stars and see it for real   yeah  i'd give anything  i don't think it's ever gonna happen   not in our lifetimes  oh  you never know   what about all those people who say they've been inside of spaceships and things  and talked to aliens   i think they're nutters  yeah  me too   so how d'you end up here   van statten has agents all over  looking for geniuses to recruit  oh  right  you're a genius   sorry  but     yeah  i can't help it   i was born clever   when i was eight  i logged onto the us defence system   nearly caused world war three  what  and that's funny  is it   you should've been there  just to see them running about  fantastic   you sound like the doctor   are you and him        no  we're just friends  good   why's that good   just is   so  wouldn't you rather be downstairs   you've got these bits of metal and stuff   but mr van statten's got a living creature down there   yeah  well  i did ask  but he keeps it to himself   although      if you're a genius   it doesn't take long to patch through on the comms system   let's have a look then   it doesn't do much  the alien   it's weird  it's kind of     useless   it's just like this great big pepperpot   man drills  dalek screams it's being tortured  where's the doctor  i don't know   take me down there  now   the metal's just battle armour  the real dalek creature is inside   what does it look like  it's a mutation  they were genetically engineered   every single emotion was removed  except hate   genetically engineered  by whom  by a genius  van statten   by a man who was king of his own little world  you'd like him   it's been on earth for over 50 years  sold at private auction   moving between collections  why would it be a threat now   because i'm here  how did it get to earth   the records say it came from the sky like a meteorite  it fell to earth on the ascension islands   burnt in its crater for three days before anybody could get near it   and all that time  it was screaming  must have gone insane   it must have fallen through time   the only survivor  you talked about a war   the time war  the final battle between my people and the daleks   but  you survived too  not by choice   this means the dalek isn't the only alien on earth  doctor   there's you  the only one of your kind in existence   now     smile   two hearts  a binary vascular system   oh  i am so gonna patent this  so that's your secret   you don't just collect stuff  you scavenge it   this technology has been falling to earth for centuries   all it took was the right mind to use it properly   oh  the advances i've made from alien junk    you have no idea  doctor  broadband  roswell   just last year  my scientists cultivated bacteria  from the russian crater  and do you know what we found   the cure for the common cold   kept it within the laboratory  of course  no need to get people excited   why sell one cure when i can sell a thousand palliatives   d'you know what a dalek is  van statten   a dalek is honest   it does what it was born to do  for the survival of its species   that creature in your dungeon is better than you  in that case  i will be true to myself   and continue   listen to me  that thing downstairs is gonna kill every last one of us   nothing can escape the cage   but it's woken up  it knows i'm here  it's gonna get out   van statten  i swear  no one on this base is safe   no one on this planet   a aah   hold it right there  level three access  special clearance from mr van statten   don't get too close   hello   are you in pain   my name's rose tyler  my friend can help  he's called the doctor   what's your name   yes   what   i am in pain   they torture me   but still they fear me   do you fear me   no   i  am dying   no  we can help         i welcome death   but i am glad  that before i die   i met a human  who was not afraid   isn't there anything i can do   my race is dead   i shall die alone   rose  no   genetic material extrapolated   initiate cellular reconstruction   what the hell have you done   what ya gonna do  sucker me to death   muffled scream  it's killing him  do something  condition red   'repeat  this is not a drill '  release me if you want to live   you've got to keep it in that cell  doctor  it's all my fault   i've sealed the compartment  the lock's got a billion combinations   a dalek is a genius  it can calculate a thousand billion combinations in one second flat   open fire   don't shoot it   i want it unharmed   rose  get out of there  gunshots  de maggio  get the civilians out alive  that is your job  got that   you  with me   electrical buzz  abandoning the cage  sir   we're losing power  it's draining the base   oh  my god  it's draining the entire power supplies of the whole of utah   it's downloading  downloading what   sir  the entire west coast has gone down   it's not just energy  that dalek just absorbed the entire internet   it knows everything   the daleks survive in me   the cameras in the vault are down  we've only got emergency power   kill it now  all guards to converge on the metaltron cage immediately   civilians  let 'em through   cover the north wall  reds  maintain suppressing fire along the perimeter  blues       agh  gunshots  gna a a argh   a aah   a a a aah   tell them to stop shooting at it  but it's killing them   they're dispensable   that dalek is unique   i don't want a scratch on its bodywork  do you hear me   do you hear me   gunshots die out  that's us  right below the surface   that's the cage  and that's the dalek   have you got any alien weapons  lots of them  but the dalek's between us and them   we've got to keep it alive  we could just seal the entire vault  leaving everyone trapped with it   rose is down there  i won't let that happen  got that   it has to go through this area  what's that  weapons testing   give guns to technicians  lawyers   anyone  everyone  only then have you got a chance of killing it   stairs  that's more like it  hasn't got legs   it's stuck   it's coming  get up   great big alien death machine   defeated by a flight of stairs   now listen to me  i demand that you return to your cage   if you want to negotiate  mr van statten will be willing to talk   i accept that we imprisoned you  and maybe that was wrong   but people have died  and that stops   right now   the killing stops  have you got that   i demand that you surrender  is that clear   el ev ate   oh  my god   adam  get her out of here   come with us  you can't stop it   someone's got to try  now get out   don't look back  just run   woman screams loudly  i thought you were the great expert  doctor   if you're so impressive  why not just reason with this dalek   it must be willing to negotiate  it must need something   everything does  what's the nearest town  salt lake city  population  one million  all dead   if the dalek gets out  it'll murder every creature  that's all it needs   but why    it honestly believes they should die  human beings are different  and different is wrong   it's the ultimate in racial cleansing  and you  van statten  let it loose   the dalek's got a force field  the bullets melt before they hit   but it's not indestructible  if you concentrate your fire  you might get through   aim for the dome   the head  the eyepiece  that's the weak spot   thank you  doctor  but i think i know how to fight one single tin robot   positions   hold your fire   you two  get the hell out of there   it was looking at me  yeah  it wants to slaughter us   no  but it was looking right at me   so  it's just a sort of metal eye thing  it's looking all around   i don't know  it's like there's something inside   looking at me  like       like it knows me   on my mark   open fire  volley of shots  we've got vision   it wants us to see   screams  fall back  fall back   perhaps it's time for a new strategy  maybe we should consider abandoning this place   except there's no power to the helipad  sir  we can't get out   you said we could seal the vault  it was designed to be a bunker in the event of nuclear war   steel bulkheads      not enough power  we've got emergency power   we can reroute that  we'd need a computer genius to bypass the security   good  thing you've got me  then  you want to help  i don't want to die  doctor  simple as that   and nobody knows this software better than me  sir         i shall speak only to the doctor   you're gonna get rusty   i fed off the dna of rose tyler   extrapolating the biomass of a time traveller  regenerated me  what's your next trick   i have been searching for the daleks   yeah  i saw   downloading the internet  what did you find   i scanned your satellites and radio telescopes   and  nothing   where shall i get my orders now   you're just a soldier without commands   then i shall follow the primary order   the dalek instinct to destroy  to conquer   what for  what's the point     don't you see  it's all gone  everything you were  everything you stood for   then what should i do   all right  then   if you want orders  follow this one   kill yourself   the daleks must survive   the daleks have failed   why don't you finish the job and make the daleks extinct   rid the universe of your filth  why don't you just die     you would make a good dalek   seal the vaults   i can leech power off the ground defences  feed it to the bulkheads   it's years since i had to work this fast  are you enjoying this   doctor  she's still down there   mobile phone rings  this isn't the best time   where are you  level 49   you've got to keep moving  the vault is being sealed off up at level 46   can't you stop them closing  i'm closing them   i can't wait  and i can't help you  now for god's sake  run   done it  power to the bulkheads  the dalek's right behind them   we're nearly there   give us two seconds   doctor  i can't sustain the power  the whole system is failing   you've got to close the bulkheads   i'm sorry   doors bleep  come on   doors bleep faster  the vault is sealed   rose  where are you  rose  did you make it   sorry  i was a bit slow   see you  then  doctor   it wasn't your fault   remember that  ok  it wasn't your fault   'and d'you know what '  i wouldn't have missed it for the world   exterminate  electrical pulse  it killed her  i'm sorry   i said i'd protect her  she was here because of me  and you're sorry     i could have killed that dalek in its cell  but you stopped me   it was the prize of my collection  your collection    well  was it worth it   worth all those men's deaths  worth rose   let me tell you something   mankind goes into space to explore  to be part of something greater       exactly  i wanted to touch the stars   you just want to drag the stars down and stick them underground underneath tons of sand and dirt   and label them   you're about as far from the stars as you can get   and you took her down with you   she was 19 years old   go on then  kill me   why are you doing this     i am armed  i will kill   it is my purpose   they're all dead because of you   they are dead because of us   and now what   what are you waiting for   i feel your fear   what d'you expect  daleks do not fear  must not fear   you gave me life   what else have you given me   i am contaminated   you were quick on your feet  leaving rose behind   i'm not the one who sealed the vault   open the bulkhead or rose tyler dies   you're alive  can't get rid of me   i thought you were dead  open the bulkhead   don't do it  what use are emotions   if you will not save the woman you love   i killed her once   i can't do it again   what do we do now  you bleeding heart  what the hell do we do   kill it when it gets here  the guns are useless   and the alien weapons are in the vault  only the catalogued ones   broken   broken   hairdryer   mr van statten tends to dispose of his staff and wipe their memory   i kept this in case i needed to fight my way out  you  in a fight   i could do  what you gonna do  throw your a levels at 'em     oh  yes   lock and load   i'm begging you  don't kill them  you didn't kill me   but why not  why are you alive   my function is to kill  what am i   what am i     don't move  don't do anything   it's beginning to question itself   van statten   you tortured me  why   i wanted to help you  i just      i don't know  i was trying to help   i thought if we could get through to you  could mend you       i wanted you better  i'm sorry   i'm so sorry  i swear  i just wanted you to talk   then hear me talk now   exterminate  exterminate   exterminate   don't do it  don't kill him  you don't have to do this any more   there must be something else  not just killing  what else is there   what do you want     i want       freedom   you're out  you made it   i never thought i'd feel the sunlight again   how does it     feel   it whirrs  get out of the way   rose  get out of the way  now  no  cos i won't let you do this   that thing killed hundreds of people   it's not the one pointing the gun at me   i've got to do this  i've got to end it   the daleks destroyed my home  my people  i've got nothing left   look at it   what's it doing   it's the sunlight  that's all it wants   but it can't      it couldn't kill van statten  it couldn't kill me   it's changing  and what about you  doctor   what the hell are you changing into   i couldn't       i wasn't       oh  rose   they're all dead   why do we survive   i don't know   i am the last of the daleks   you're not even that   rose did more than regenerate you   you've absorbed her dna   you're mutating   into what   something new   i'm sorry   isn't that better   not for a dalek   i can     feel  so many ideas   so much darkness   rose  give me orders   order me to die   i can't do that   this is not life   this is sickness   i shall not be like you   order my destruction   obey   obey  obey   do it   are you frightened  rose tyler   yeah   so am i   exterminate   what the hell are you doing  and all because of you  sir   take him away  wipe his memory and leave him by the road someplace   you can't do this to me  i am henry van statten   by tonight  henry
