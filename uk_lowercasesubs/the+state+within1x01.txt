condoning the appalling events of yesterday   all i m saying is that the stance the ukand the us take internationally   it can be interpreted by certain groups as provocation   can you elaborate on that   right  well  take tyrgyztan  where i was ambassador   since  99  the ukand the us have invested over 50 billion dollars   and at the same time 10 000 political prisoners have disappeared under president usman s rule   did you inform your government at the time of suspected human rights abuse   of course  but every cable i sent to london  nothing   deafening silence from the other end  and that s when i started to speak up   you re saying the ukgovernment deliberately ignored your allegations   not only that  they hauled me home  slapped my wrists   and when that didn t work  they sacked me   it s this questionable support of corrupt regimes that helps inflame the enemies of the west   thank you  james   that was james sinclair  british ambassador to tyrgyztan  1997 to 2001   now back to the news team for an update on the terrorist attack   well  you re looking well   you missed me on the telly     coffee  sir    i m not staying  thank you   we re getting a good response

can t even be seen with you   then why did you ask to meet me   stop calling the embassy   don t try and use our relationship to further your cause   this isn t my cause  you know bloody well what s going on in tyrgyztan     this has to stop  all right   for christ s sake   this is for azzam   why don t you give it to him yourself  i m sure he d like to get to know his godfather   tell him     i wish circumstances were different   he s nine years old  all he knows is people in his life disappear   just leave me alone   dulles airport is scheduled to reopen at 11 00   the first of the relatives arrive this afternoon   the authorities are very jittery  one unclaimed suitcase  they will shut down the entire system   has anyone claimed responsibility   islamic european jihad  but no serious contenders   as far as we know  it could be white supremacists  a lone nutter   how s this playing in the uk media   it s mostly leading with mutual grief of two allied countries   i ve told sally she should cancel tonight s reception   absolutely not  we go ahead   let s put a release out  show our resolve  something along the lines of  um      yesterday s tragedy will not distract us from pursuing our international aims    please let s avoid the  spirit of the blitz  clich    i ll run it past you before i issue     next    james sinclair   do we need to draft a rebuttal denying the claims he s made about uk us aid to tyrgyztan   and our support for president usman s government   don t give that windbag oxygen   phil s right  no comment on his visit  next   luke gardner s death row appeal is before the supreme court this week   we expect the ruling in the next couple of days   jane lavery  our new human rights liaison  has gone down to florida  to coordinate with the release campaign   there s interest in this both sides of the pond  falklands hero on death row   thank you     where s sam    sorry   my lawyer  sam levinson   i wanted the opportunity to talk to you

your appeal   the supreme court is ruling on whether you received ineffective representation   you re wasting my time   if you re not prepared to talk to me  you re wasting mine   now  your previous counsel failed to introduce evidence from witnesses  who claimed they saw you two miles from the scene of the murder     fighting with a cab driver    i can t remember a cab driver   i can t remember most of that year   well  if you can t remember  how do you know you didn t kill those giris   i d know  i ve had blood on my hands before   the foreign office have a strong anti death penalty stance   regardless of your innocence or guilt  i m here to inform you  that they have made official representation to the supreme court     heads or tails    what   heads or tails  choose   heads   you ve chosen to die by lethal injection   now  they say it takes four minutes to die   but the doctor doesn t pronounce for 15   i bet you wished you d picked tails now  eh  jane   you tell me   death by electric chair   you ever smelt burning flesh   it stays in your nostrils for life   but they say it s quicker   but do i really want that to be my mum s last memory of me   tricky call  i m not some kind of freak show   so you take your anti death penalty stance  and you get me the fuck out of here  all right  bitch     come in    we have a problem   ah  could you excuse us a moment   one of the british passengers on the plane  hassan khan     mi6 have turned up a second identity    which is   ibrahim wahid   suspected of having links to a jihadi training camp  and the islamist movement of tyrgyztan     tyrgyztan    it s on the northern border of afghanistan   i know where it is   national security advisor s in your office  ma am   tyrgyztan  they re supposed to be our goddamn allies   it s tough enough keeping a lid on the mid east  what  now we have a central asia dimensi n   according to mi6  president usman claims to have suppressed the militants     christopher    we have our doubts  ma am   we re paying that ingrate  100 million a year to scratch his balls  jesus   scramble f 16s from our bases there and bomb the terrorists for him   show the asshole how it s done   suspect bomber was a british national   any link to a militant group in tyrgyztan  give me strength   i m supposed to be standing shoulder to shoulder with the brit ambassador  in our moment of loss   it turns out it s one of their home grown massacring our people   didn t 7 7 teach them anything  for christ s sake   what should we tell the speech writers   oh  try   lf britain s our friend  who needs enemies    the hunt for the terrorist group behind the bombing of flight 113  took on a new dimensi n today  as intelligence sources released information on their chief suspect   several news channels are reporting links between hassan khan ibrahim wahid  and militants in the hills of tyrgyztan   also an al qaeda group in north pakistan   where the bloody hell are they getting this stuff   all right  i m gonna need a complete dossier on khan wahid  full background   home life  schooling  mosque  overseas travel   and see if you can find out from your guys in mi6 exactly who these groups are   what their aims are  we need to sort out the facts from the fiction   someone s leaked this before we can prepare a proper response   sure   paul  has forensics turned up anything on the bomb   debris indicates the explosives were in the hold  they re not certain what type or grade yet   it s looking that they were detonated by an electronic signal from the passenger deck   mark  it s garcia   carl  yes  of course   not at all  goodbye  sir     we re going to the west wing    invited or summoned   in the situations room in five   how the hell did the bastard slip under your radar

passports and closed our borders   if she lets this damage uk us relations  she ll be doing the terrorists  job for them   for christ s sake  mark  there are american body parts on a beltway courtesy of a brit muslim   you ve tolerated these extremists too long   sure  we re not gonna slash and burn england  but the president has to be seen to do something   what if i get the pm out here in a gesture of solidarity   too soon  that ll just expose him to a tidal wave of public anger   people are panicking   the us could be facing a new wave of suicide attacks   if you don t want hysteria

mark brydon  kcmg   her majesty s ambassador to washington   i d like to thank you all very much for coming here this evening   these are frightening  uncertain times   but it s in adversity we find our true friends   and that s why i m especially pleased and honoured to be able to welcome lynne warner   secretary of defense for the united states government   may this gathering serve as a reminder of the bonds that unite us today   will unite us tomorrow and shall never be broken   madam secretary   i thought long and hard before coming tonight   but yesterday s events were a violent reminder of the forces out there  who wish to sabotage not only the us democratic way of life   but also our economic and commercial interests throughout the worid   i stand here tonight        to give full warning to those who wish to undermine us   the people of america will not allow fear to haunt their lives   wherever our rights and freedoms are threatened  we will stop at nothing to defend ourselves   the governor of virginia is rounding up all british muslims in his state and detaining them   this is an illegal act  never mind that it s a breach of international law     it shows total disregard for basic human rights    that is for congress to decide   as i understand  the governor of virginia is acting under the powers of the patriot act   we don t even know who s behind the attack   pakistani fundamentalists  tyrgyztani islamists  saudi     the bastard with his finger on the button was british   and from what i hear  they re plenty more queuing up right behind him   do you know how many british muslims there are in virginia     it only takes one    at least 3 000   holidaymakers  students  business travellers  visa holders   you re saying they re all terrorist suspects     it s an obscene act of racial discrimination    obscene   ask the guys riding your subway who s being discriminated against  next time some wacko decides to detonate himself   i played along with your little stunt out there  all right   all that hot air about strong bonds and unity   but my son did not die in afghanistan so that our so called allies  could blow themselves up in our own backyard   if governor norris believes that these suspects are a threat to the security of his citizens   he has my 100    support   virginia authorities aren t being very cooperative   but it appears a rough estimate of 200 british muslims have been picked up across state   they re being moved to fort bird national guard barracks  their passports are being confiscated     give me the governor s number    he s refusing to come to the phone   too busy declaring a state of emergency   what the hell  you ll wake the building     what are you playing at    what am i playing at   you re the one that s puffed up like a cobra   defense intelligence  your department  leaked intel that there was a brit suicide bomber   do you have proof of that   don t play that game  not with me  we re in meltdown   you ve got a xenophobic maniac locking up british citizens   governor norris has every right to protect the people who put him in power   you re deliberately fuelling anger   now we ve got a witch hunt  you must know how dangerous that is   whatever your reasons  they d better be worth it   are you done now   what do you want   he didn t do it  he didn t do it  he deserves better     who    gardner  who do you think     jane    he didn t do it  all right   hey  hey  you know that guy   hey  buddy  don t move   he accosted me in a dark car park     it could be construed as intimidation    don t blame me  i m not responsible   how come he s so certain you re innocent  could he be used as a witness   look  death row cases attract the crazies  all right   look  i m trying to help you   you may know him  he s your age  heavyset  wired  scared       of flight 113 took on a new dimensi n today     he said you deserve better   well  i don t know the bastard  all right     the bomber of the airbus was british      time s up   wait  wait  i was watching that  let me just watch it  let me get       open up    just me have a look at it       was also known as ibrahim wahid   a terrorist with established connections to groups close to al qaeda   think you re gonna escape me  man   it s not gonna happen       statement this morning  governor norris stands by his belief  that the enforced detentions are a necessary and correct response  to protect the security of the state of virginia   it s gonna be another beautiful day in the lovers  state   but not for the 200 british muslims held at fort bird   the british citizens were arrested yesterday after the revelation  that the flight 113 bomber was a british muslim by the name of hassan khan   governor norris ordered them to be taken to fort bird  where they can be held for up to seven days       oh  god  we re going to be arrested     while the authorities decide  whether to deport them or bring criminal charges     there is chaos on the highways      we ve got to get out of here   don t worry  don t worry     please  shahid  i don t want to get      whoa  whoa     stop  we ll shoot    stop the vehicle or we ll shoot   stop   sir mark brydon  british ambassador  nasreen qureshi  press secretary   the police made some calls   they told friends they were frightened they d be rounded up   they were trying to get to maryland     how old were they    25 and 24     she was three months pregnant    jesus christ   right  make sure the names don t go out until the family s been informed   right   whilst admitting the deaths of these young people was a tragic accident   governor norris says he plans to stand by his decisi n to detain the british muslims   civil liberty organisations across the us are petitioning the president  against the legality of the governor s actions   the secretary of state and the attorney general are scheduled to meet later today     hello  mark brydon    hi  i
