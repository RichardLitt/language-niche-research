 this programme contains adult humour  welcome to st saviour's on this rather cold sunday morning   it's nice to see so many faces here today who are so familiar   the lord be with you   and also with you   almighty god  to whom all hearts are open  all desires known   and from whom no secrets are hidden   cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration  of your holy spirit  that we may perfectly love you and worthily magnify your holy name   through jesus christ our lord   amen   amen   i thought the sermon was electrifying today  adam   it gave me shivers   thank you  adoha  it's hard to be rousing when there's only five of you   can i have a word with you  adam   hello  archdeacon  how nice to see you  i wasn't expecting you   i'm a bit worried about you  adam  is everything

nigel   oh  yes  it's an upsettingly small turnout today   is there a tube strike on  no   alex is at the police station  oh  yeah  well  that's one   yes  er  olanna has gone to the primark sale   steve warwick's taken his daughters to gymnastics  mike swan has a cheese stall at the farmers' market   margaret's gone to visit her mother     nigel  i don't need the individual gps location of every single member of your congregation   unfortunately  archdeacon  the reality is sometimes people just   don't come   you're late paying your parish share again   there's another cheque on the way  is there  what was your congregation plate this morning  mm      60   you mean 20   no  no  it was much more than that  it was  er   40   it was     24 07   i saw you putting in 20 yourself  it's not against the rules  is it   well  there's a general feeling that you're letting the side down a bit   not my words of course  words of the area dean   you know how the wealthy parishes grumble when their money  this isn't an empty church  the congregation will be back up next week   will it  i'll be back to see if you're right  care for some instant   no  i can't linger  i've got tickets for chelsea man u   oh  there you are   double your collection plate  oh   what's rowan talking about now  is it interesting   he's talking about his childhood in swansea   you've been reading that for three months   well  you know it's not a quick read  it isn't easy read   how about you put rowan down and hold me instead   do you think i should do a leaflet drop  what   i've got to increase my congregation numbers   sorry  i can't help it  i've got to get my numbers up   you know sometimes weeks go by without us having sex   no  they don't  yes  because one or other of us is always too tired  or distracted by work   we need to rekindle things  darling   i want some excitement   i want to be seduced   now  no  not now   but soon    would you like me to dress up as a vicar   dear lord  if you don't mind me bringing this up  could you give me more energy in bed   i'm so exhausted all the time and it's not fair on alex  she deserves to be happy   please help me find more time and energy for her  and it   and please help me get my numbers up   why do you make finance such a constant daily issue for us   shouldn't i be spreading your word and building the kingdom rather than worrying about money   i gather wine's a good investment at the moment and property in bulgaria   and i hope you don't find the size of my flock insultingly small   if you've got any ideas on how to fill this place  i'd love to hear them   hello  can i help you   hi  yes  you must be adam  er yes  er  i'm  i'm adam   i'm darren   i love your church  adam   it's awesome   thank you   adam  we've

hundred   yeah  do you have space for us all for a sunday   um  er  probably  er  perhaps   yes  how would you describe your worship at st james's  darren   mm  we mostly use the international bible  ah  but  er  we don't have to   you're charismatics  then  no     i'd say we are evangelical   but in a kind of chilled  friendly way  you know   we love god but we're not out to convert people  right   cos i do have a problem with the way that the charismatics sometimes  seem to let their emotions supplant theology  yeah  me too   look why don't i come down here on sunday and give a little service   if you like us we can hook up more often and if you don't  absolutely not a problem   they really are a very  very cool bunch   do you think your whole bunch would come  absolutely   well all right  darren  let's try it once and see how it goes   awesome   of course i have fantasies   what are they then  they're just  you know  male fantasies   they're all about you  ha   yes  course they are  then that doesn't make them fantasies  does it  because i'm here   what  what's yours  tell me yours   you know mine  do i   tell me again   sex in a lift  in public somewhere  being naughty when there are strangers around   dressing as a stripper  as a prostitute and being picked up by someone famous   being serviced by two faceless men who are only interesting in satisfying me   being dominated  being tied up and captured by a man i'm sexually attracted to  who treats me very nicely while pleasuring me  and then instantly falls in love with me in a lift   if only we had a lift   but they're just fantasies  they're not meant to happen   well  maybe some of them  perhaps the stripper   or being naughty in public  it's a bit tricky with my job   no  it isn't  no  i'll show you   i love you  thank you for cooking and cancelling the homeless meal for me   i love you too   buzzer  ignore it  please   banging on door  buzzer  it'll just be colin  it might not be   mick  i'm not

aren't there   god's love is far more profound than physical love   it's powerful  ceaseless  ineffable   but sometimes you just want to stick it in  don't you   hi  morning   darren  hey  adam   pretty awesome  huh   i didn't know you doing all this   it's great isn't it  i always like to joke that  the more god loves you  the better your pa system   i haven't got a faculty permission for any of this   don't panic  keep your cassock on  we will have it put back to the cold barn it was before   jesus is awesome  isn't he   this all looks good  adam   a bit friendlier  was this your idea

as usual   er  not today  adoha  next week  it's smoothies today  just for once   this is wrong  adam   you know coffee should be served in church  not this girl's fruits  and where are my flowers   hello  everyone  hello   as  as the vicar of st saviours  i just wanted to welcome you all here  today and what a lot of you there are  it's a  it's a wonderful sight   i'm delighted that    hello  guys  so good to see you all   and how cool is it to be here in this awesome church   and it is also great  jesus  to have you here with us today   we're going to need some monster donations from you guys today  if we're to reach our expansion targets   so don't forget to fill out one of our standing order forms  or maybe a direct debit   it's all very  very straightforward  of course we do now accept all major credit and debit cards   now i want to talk about the adulteress in john's gospel  chapter eight   only last week i met a woman who'd given in to temptation   a drug addict off her face on whizz  selling herself in order to fund her addiction     this is great  isn't it  give me some of that  colin     the healing power of jesus's love  she no longer does that   you see we all have to fight against temptations in life  don't we  yeah  and i want to talk    hiya     about her journey to salvation  but before we do that   shall we get ikon up here   right on your feet     i felt my life was like a heavy sinner's    that was until i came to you for repentance    look at the size of my love yeah    that's all for you above   oh  oh     i didn't like my behaviour    i should have known that christ was the saviour    i surrender to you you're the one    i'll give it up for you and you son    send me your love put my sins in remission    i believe in you  lord you're not superstition    let me feel the power of your love bring it    like it was a shower from above sing it    sing it sing it    love me  take me  jesus make me feel brand new    love me  take me  jesus our resurrected jew    love me  take me  jesus make me feel brand new    love me  take me  jesus our resurrected jew    love me  take me  jesus     yeah  all right   anyway she said   i didn't know that  i thought it was the relief postman    killer that  innit  eh   oh  hi  darren  thank you for that  that was a real eye opener   well  it's been an absolute joy  we would love to come back next sunday   well  i've been very glad to do this once  darren   but i'm afraid it won't be right to have you back again next week   why not  well  if you'll allow me  because i think  what you do is more of a show than a sacrament  and i don't think it's quite right for my congregation   wasn't that the most wonderful service  adam   full of song and colour and emotion   oh  what a clever  gorgeous vicar you are  yes  so good looking   hello  you two  how are you getting along together   yes  very well  thank you   what an extraordinary service  it certainly was   memorable  great bunch   very clever of you both   you know i said to the father  i said   father i want all you've got    and if it blows my mind  let it blow  yeah    did you experience jesus  oh  yes  several times   i was just saying to adam here how much we would love to come back next sunday   er  yes  well  we'll have to see   i have a cheque here from my church to yours for     10 000   i'm sure it'll go towards whatever it is you do here   goodness gracious  darren  that's very generous   yes  well  the dean will be delighted   i hope we'll see the fruits of this   of course   ok  gentlemen  well done   enjoy your sunday   play nicely   oh  hello  alex  what are you     shh  i'm not alex   i'm vivienne  what's your name   i'm darren   i'll just get these   are you serious   quick as you can  please  lisa   no way  shut up   no  at the end of the day  i didn't even call her a slag  no    i didn't   seriously  babe   er  sorry  hang on a minute  what   oh  darren  oh  darren   buzzer  no  me     don't mind me   want me to do round the back     love me  take me  jesus make me feel brand new    love me  take me  jesus     sorry  i can't seem to get that hip hop hymn out of my head  yeah  it's   catchy stuff   very different from your services  all that energy and pizzazz   must say darren is very good looking   yes  i've got an e mail from him here  saying he's looking forward to seeing me again soon   he's not coming back is he  no  i was very clear to him   hello  vicars   i have had the best time ever   have you  where have you been  colin   on a two day  be transformed  course at center parcs  i am so   transformed   the st james's lot   they're just so friendly  and they paid for everything   th there was parties  and we talked about jesus     here y'are  check this  vics   they gave us free stuff  and glowsticks  this one says  jesus    and this one says  transform    and there was smoothies     oh   there were so many smoothies   and lectures on how to deal with sex  and how to cure people of being a poof   and the girls are mega hot   i can't wait to see 'em all again this sunday when they come back 'ere   sorry  hang on   darren's not coming back here this sunday  colin   yeah  they are  they all are   darren's down there right now  awesome  yeah   i can't wait to see pip again   i think she really likes me   so what exactly is the problem  adam   we're all partners in the gospel  aren't we   but the thing is i don't necessarily think that jesus is er   absolutely the answer to every single question   he is  though  well  i don't think so   i think that faith must encounter doubt  and all i get from you is certainty   that's right  so i don't think a blending of our styles is going to work   i'm going to have to ask you to not attend any more   your church was empty  adam     now it's full  because we appeal to people   you don't   our god is a success     and that scares you   your services scare me  that's what scares me   your services  they scare me   you have no sense of this parish   and i dread to think what your views are on gays and women priests   well  your pathetic  liberal acceptance of them disgusts me   when you know they're wrong   the bible tells us  st matthew tells us     this church is ours now  adam   and you need to acknowledge that   no   be my friend  adam   be god's friend   there'll be no interruptions tonight  i promise   so get ready for a night of hot romancing   alex giggles yes     i'm ready  darren   tie me up and take me to erm       heaven  like  my kind of heaven   ping  going down     reverberating hip hop music  can you hear that   rapping    i should have known that christ was a saviour    i surrender to you  you're the one    i give it up for you and your son       darren  what are you doing   this is my home  go away   oh  we were just praying for you  adam   well  stop it   what you doing up there  adam   i     none of your business  i'm extremely busy  darren   can you go away  please   get out  bugger off   this is criminal  this is harassment   engine starts up  go on  what are you looking at  go away       love me  take me  jesus  our resurrected jew    love me  take me  jesus       i understand your concern  of course i do  adam   the problem for you   for us    is that the dean just loves the st james's lot   does he  i didn't have him down as a hard line evangelical   no  i think he went on one of their be transformed courses at butlins   said   it was magical and very exciting   and i haven't been able  to get a word of sense out of him since   of course  in purely financial terms  i should be congratulating you   as you know  it was agreed at the deanery synod last week  that darren should preach at your place once a month   what   no  they can't do that  i won't allow that   well  weren't you at the meeting  um  no  not on this occasion   why not   because they're incredibly dull  do you go to them   well  of course i do  well  darren can't preach without my approval   it's my church  i'll run it how i like  of course   but i'd strongly recommend you don't do that   i don't know what to do  can you think somewhere else   i'm expected at one of gordon ramsay's soft openings   so i'm going to drop you out   here   quick  quick   so  john 15 makes us ask  if you were hanging out with jesus and his posse   what would you say to the fella   i'm gonna give you the top ten tips on how to be a friend of god   get off me  get off  you're disgusting   well  jesus told me to do it   pip is extremely distressed   she's having a smoothie   and she will never be able to come back to this church   she's wearing a chastity bracelet  she's clearly a virgin   a born again virgin   i want that man barred from this church  i'm not doing that  darren   colin's been a regular here for 15 years   is there no chance you could forgive him  we may well prosecute    lord  how many times am i to forgive my neighbour  as many as seven times     70 times seven   said the lord     70 times seven  70 times       pip is a vital part of our congregation  yeah   colin isn't vital to anybody darren   except god   and if god loves you  darren  then he loves colin just as much   colin's presence in this church is a blessing   colin is a dangerous person    who smells funky   archdeacon  please understand   if that man is not barred from this church  i'm going to have to take my large  giving   very generous congregation somewhere else   darren  we can't be seen to bar anyone from our churches   you know that  especially those in need   even though he touched her bottom   even though he touched her bottom  which i'm not condoning   but   there's my answer   well  i feel for you both  no wonder your church is in crisis   i shall take my large  devoted gang  and my money  elsewhere   any chance you can leave the smoothie bar   thank you   congregation    he who would valiant be    'gainst all disaster    let him in constancy    follow the master       are you ok  colin   yeah  yeah  course   i just miss pip a bit  is all   i was in a dilemma with her  cos  well  i did like her a lot    mm     but she was also a massive prick tease   what you did was wrong  you know that  don't you   i only pinched her arse   no  but you can't do that  it's horrible for women   people lose jobs because of that sort of thing   that said  of course  if you hadn't done it   darren and his lot would still be here  so   thanks   you can always count on me  vicar   phone rings  hello  my darling wife  'hello  is that darren
