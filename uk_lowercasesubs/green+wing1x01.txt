said you were an unreliable neighbour   but the man from number 37 has a big heart and a ladder   so  as i was saying  the fuel consumption on both models is fairly similar   but the variable valve timing on the xk8 really helps acceleration at low speeds   gives you that extra bit of wallop   in terms of litres  you can really do what you want   3 8  3 9  it's your call   yeah  yeah  yeah  but     which one's gonna make me look young   well  neither  they are both just cars   i am starting a new job at 8 30 in a hospital   i am dirty and exhausted   people will possibly die as a result  and you will be responsible   you know i could damage you quite badly for wasting my time   yeah   listen  thanks  anyway  it was really kind of you for trying   and you'll be paying for a locksmith  all right    ohh   oh  oh  erm    sorry   don't try and move your neck  you'll be fine  i'm a doctor   uh uh uh  i said don't move   i don't know if you ever go to the winners gym  but i'm there most

be intelligent  but humble   men  women and small children will fall in love with her instantly   she might be latin  olive skin  husky voice   that'll be nice for everyone   put all these elements together  what have we got   we've got potentially  today in this hospital   a very tall  genius  woman of the people    berbabe  latino chick coming to work here     will she be too tall to get through doors    no  she'll be the perfect height   good  well  that's all tickety boo by me     so  not even a flicker    no     not even the tiniest bit    no  no  no   cos jealousy is an ugly emotion and only for the weak   what i want you to do for me  just once   try it  pretend     why  because it turns you on    yes  please  for me   if you see the new bitch  snap off her fingers  burn her hair and pluck out her nipples   yes  fanta    how did you feel   dangerous  liberating  yeah  orgasmic   exhilarating  in a dirty sort of way     are you all right    oh  yeah   there's a new female doctor coming today  so    that's all     do you want to sign kerry's birthday card    no  not really     do you want to contribute to the present    no  not really     do you want to sign

of time as well   oh  don't worry  if i had to do a school run  i'd never get to work on time    come on  back in the car  off to school   here we come  no time to chase you    ouch   what can i do for you this time  dr statham     i'd like a new badge  please    what happened to the old one   i've still got it  i'm sorry to report it's been vandalised by some bloody bastards     in what way    rather not talk about it   if you don't  i can't order you a new one   and wh where does it say that in the regulations   there   all right  erm     somebody has used a marker pen to make some alterations   the badge should read  dr alan statham   next line  consultant radiologist    on  consultant   they've blacked out the letters  o n s  and  l t a    i see  so that would in fact leave     a c  a u  an n and an       yes  yes  exactly    oh  i see   so your badge now reads  alan statham     cun      yes  that's what it's been changed to     again    yes  again   well  all right  i'll see what i can do   it's gonna take a couple of weeks to order a new one   what am i going to do in the meantime   i suggest you black out the bits you don't want   well  th that    right  i will   i'd lose the second line rather than the first     what    just trying to help   is that for me   thanks very much there  thank you   sweet   mmm   oh  that's  erm     that's quite interesting  what is that     you don't know    i found it in my bed   would you say you're asian  it would really help my end of year quotas   it's a bit hard to tell in this light  but i think we might get away with it   come on  come on  come on   staff liaison ought to be here to sort out your bits and bobs   talking of bits and bobs  i do have a bit of an accommodation problem     a curious smell  sort of  erm  toiletty     have you been to a festival    i had to spend the night in my car  so     ah  walk and talk   this is the same gall bladder   and here we can see the small object has become dislodged  and is now down here   this is what i like to call the     mick jagger effect   because it is essentially a rolling stone     which is a joke  you may laugh      you're not laughing  mr boyce     that's because it wasn't funny    yes  it was   not really     i'll be the judge of that    you can't be the judge   you don't find it funny because you know very little about imaging techniques   when you've had as much experience as i have  you will find it funny     i doubt it    hm   hm   you can't make me laugh by poking me   well  just     heed me  hm      and radiology   sorry to interrupt you  i wanted to introduce the new surgical registrar  doctor caroline       caroline todd    dr alan statham  consultant radiologist   welcome to the lunatic asylum   you don't have to be mad to work here but it helps   well  no  come on  hang on  now  the doctors aren't mad here   i mean  that certainly wouldn't be allowed  not at my level   but we are an equal opportunities employer  so there might be some ancillary workers   or even some clerical staff  who might be considered a bit     dear god  we'll have to be moving along   so sorry to have disturbed    you     i'm like a loaded catapult    i can't talk right now     have you seen them  the juniors  the students  martin  boyce  all of them     yeah  what about them    well  a new woman turns up   a frankly pretty ordinary woman  and they're all like bees round a honeypot     no  no  bees make honey  don't they    yeah  so   yeah  so why are bees bothering with a pot of honey  yeah   why not stay back at the hive  where there's as much honey as they could have   why flap all the way down to the supermarket  or somebody else's house   or wherever this honeypot is  when there's plenty of honey at home     well  flies round a honeypot    flies prefer shit   well  wasps  the fact is  it makes men look like a sad  desperate species   so you probably think that it would be better if everybody was a little bit more like you     well  yeah    yeah  well  no   because then  of course  there would be a great surge in lesbianism   bet you can't head butt that sign   yeah  well  that was actually quite an easy one   nice   no  no  no  but it is funny  you do see that  don't you   well  it makes sense  a rolling stone   yes  thank you  i thought i was going mad for a minute   you see  dr macartney  some people do have a sense of humour   sorry  i'm with boycie on this one  angela was being polite   yes  well  who asked you  anyway   i think you did  about two minutes ago   ooh  erm     any news on the other thing     what other thing    whether moustaches are back in fashion   no  no news  you'll keep me posted   i'll let you know when they find a blonde with more than two brain cells to rub together   not you   or you  obviously you've got lots  well done   but you  dr macartney  are about as intelligent  as a gracilis myocutaneous flap on a perineal hernia repair     banter     sorry  sorry   was that a comeback  i didn't hear it  i was about 20 yards down the corridor   but emma said something about you were talking to a lightbox     shall i report that earring    if i can report the moustache   most women find male body piercing repugnant   i  thankfully  am completely intact   even i draw the line at piercing arseholes   exactly   ju       banter    yes   ow   when you're ready  martin   well  erm     the patients don't like me   really  anything else     no    good   well  don't hesitate to pop in again if there are any other worries   what  is that it     will you go out with me    no  get out   oh  i love the smell of formaldehyde   i must say  you're not as young as i thought you'd be   oh  my sainted lord in heaven  what is this bollocks   val two   i thought i said no more fucking rainbows   yeah  over my rotting cadaver  i'd rather stick pins in my eyes  can you deal with it     sit     walkie talkies aren't allowed in hospitals    it's a talking pager   it's a walkie talkie  they're dangerous  they could interfere with vital equipment   dangerous  and i suppose a flood  or a patient on fire   or an outbreak of aids isn't dangerous  hm    ooh  ow
