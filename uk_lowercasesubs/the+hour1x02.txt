this new programme   it's everything we've been waiting for   mr lyon  i'm a very big fan of your work   which bit of my work   have you heard of peter darrall  he was killed last night   it'll be reported as a robbery   it wasn't   mccain's in   we are embarking on a truly exciting journey   the hour is coming    look at this man   this is mr reginald thomson   like many young men newly arrived from the west indies   he needs a place to rest for the night   not far from victoria would be best   he starts a new job at the railway station tomorrow  and he wants to be on time for work   now look to my left  this is mr alfred baker   also newly arrived in the city  also about to take up employment tomorrow  in the clerk's office close to lincoln's inn   victoria is not an ideal location     and now comes the smile     but it's cheap and needs must  yes  there it is   here's what happened when we followed them in their search for lodgings   counting down three  two  one    roll  freddie  i'm going in   victoria  you will find a hotel or a bed and breakfast  on every street to take a guest in search of shelter   are you in discomfort or does it just seem as if you have a pickle up your backside    freddie   i want that man banned from the set   it's camera two then back to camera one   three cameras  three lights  you're a beat behind every time   colonies  all with hopes     when it's red  you hit your light   if i could see my light then i would hit my light   clear the set  please  ladies and gentleman   he's here  go in hard on the first question  have you got them   yes  i know what i'm doing   mr thomson  could you tell us what happened   the lady was very polite     ron  star jumps behind the bloody camera if you have to   behave   mr lyon       i can't breathe   i'll let the american space programme know   if you're white  then you're all right   freddie lyon  reporting for the hour   ok  and go to camera two     one  er  one  camera one  sorry   good evening mr gabot  it's gabord  not gabot   you're an expert on immigration  that was an interesting insight  into the prejudice faced by an immigrant arriving in london   well  yes  it was   although i don't know the notting hill area well   something's wrong  ask the question  ask the bloody question   and where are you from   well  actually  biggin hill   the congestion is particularly bad     interrupt him  interrupt     the a232 and join the a236 at croydon     he hasn't got the questions     to wandsworth bridge   once over the river i do find it's preferable to follow the fulham palace road   anything rather than face the hoards on the bayswater road   i'm sure your viewers would agree with that   three weeks       you said three weeks   four  i said give him four   and we're clear  that's a wrap  everyone   erm  hello   ron  move that mars set   we won't be needing it   how difficult is it   we write the questions  you ask them   questions on the future of the british colony of cyprus   a slot you scrapped   it's not my fault you don't pick up the right sheet   i'm not a bloody puppet  no  you're right  the puppet wanted more  freddie   away   right  your charm is wearing thin  hector   i wouldn't call it charm   i call it trying to make the best of a shoddily run show   it's a farce  it's a bloody farce   mad arm waving  you screaming at me   no  you are the farce  you   clarence  clarence   we've got a terrific piece for next week on the credit squeeze  it's very exciting  very exciting   i look forward to it  you should  you really should  good night   brilliant   i'm sorry   next week       do better  please do better   because if you don't then freddie wins 12 shillings  and my entire bill haley collection   knock on door  you're pathetic   merci  madame   ah  here   oh  don't give him any  they won't let him on the flight   you're on fiery form tonight   drink up   whisky is god's way of telling us that he loves us  and he wants us to be happy   night   oh  no  thanks  i'm all squiffy on a shandy  do you need anything else  miss rowley   no  it's fine  i'll see you on monday  ok  night   all  night   rumour has it she can type   she's probably taking the a297423   biggin hill   all laugh it was rather like a flaying fish   laughter continues  really  mr gabot  do tell   do tell us more   well  i usually take the a2678453 to absolutely the middle of going nowhere  ssh  he's outside   laughter never mind the immigration crisis     lift and shove   lift    lift and shove  banging at door  lift and shove   lift  and shove   she laughs  that is really very dangerous   for the person trying to get in or for the person trying to get out   what if there was a fire and you couldn't get out   or someone tried to break in  i could unpick that with a toothpick if i wanted to   really  bel  it's hopeless   oh  freddie  you're very sweet    when you're not being such a mutant   oh  no   i'll have to do this lying down   nice to see my bill haley collection   just checking for scratches   it was all a bad dream   don't be wet   i think i might cry now   no  don't look at me   he clears his throat  have you finished   no   yes  no  no  not yet   it's all gone horribly wrong   teething troubles   you did it on purpose  didn't you   gave hector the wrong questions   no   he sighs yes  i don't know   i'm not sleeping brilliantly at the moment  oh  you should sleep   everyone needs their beauty sleep   not everyone   general chatter  'i'm not speaking to you '  what do you expect me to say   peter was a   a nice chap  a little flirtatious  perhaps   i don't really approve of that sort of thing  all these young girls  it   it does go on  of course   you shared the same office  and rarely spoke  the odd formal dinner  a coffee here or there   he liked to fish  i do not  why are you lying to me   he was short of money  i was very busy   he'd fill in for me every other week   fill in  crosswords   i set the crosswords  peter was always very interested   really  i   i'm very sorry   which newspaper  which newspaper did he set the crossword for   evening standard   the last one he set was printed the day after he died   that's done it   i'm terribly sorry   clarence  miss rowley   yes     sorry    though his glare may so far be a little dim    let us pray mr madden will guide this rudderless ship  namely the hour    there is only so long that one can wait    one can only hope for a better tomorrow    lift doors ping  shall we   freddie   you don't like me  do you   it's not personal  huh   you went to a minor public school in     sherborne   not so minor  then  where you excelled at cricket  rugby and fives  i bet you were     head boy  then cambridge  where everyone hoped for a first   but sadly you partied more than you should   met the right people and had a ball  your parents were naturally disappointed   but what's an upper   lower second   third   still  you had fun   indeed i did  whereas mugs like me slaved away at a second rate university  with very little of what you call a good time for a paltry  unrecognised first    most of it in a haze of misery  but i digress   then    no  not sure what happened then but probably     welsh guards  you've seen service   oh  god  you've got a medal   two   ha    absurd   so after victory at the d day landing  you came home   looked about you and set your sights on television presenting   you started at a regional station  possibly manchester   i was on the sports desk  occasional outside broadcast   but your wife didn't like the    people   she got on the phone to pater and before your insignificant producer could say    how did that happen   he's watching you front your very own tv programme   while he  despite 40 years of loyal service   is stuck in manchester  crying into his beer   as i say  it's not personal  i just don't like privilege  god   you're a snob   we can't use this  we have no    no  no  no  it's got to be egypt  egypt  egypt   there are furious anti british tirades playing continuously on their radio   for weeks now   until you have something to break  we can't run it as a story yet   freddie  abolition of hanging   second reading in the house of lords this afternoon  take a camera  mmm hmm   right  anyone else   thank you  anyone else   time is ticking  we are cutting it fine  as ever   again  nasser  egypt  thank you  lix   we have one day to go  we don't have a programme yet   the premium bonds story works   macmillan's backing it  we could use the footage of the labour strike   cutting it fine  but    brilliant  what question would you put to our chancellor  if  say  you were to interview him  hector  preferably the right one   but please do feel free to intervene  mr lyon    a man of your impressive record  any pointers you could throw my way   i still say we go with egypt  no  i think hector's got the story   oh  it's what's of interest to the man on the street  lix  isaac's got a very good piece on   uum     smokeless fuel  life after the clean air act   remarkable  think you could manage that  hector   interviewing a slice of irish bog  i don't know  that depends   if i'm given correct questions and they're less provocative  more succinct   i won't grapple to find a decent interview   i will not have you squabbling like this  you're like children  you're like bloody children   is anybody listening to me  egypt is the story    i am not your mother  and i am not your nurse  so just grow up  all of you  just grow up   i'm sorry  i can't work like this  excuse me  clarence   sorry  clarence    the hour is like watching the car you've always dreamed of   being driven by a man who has never sat behind a wheel    telegraph   your job is to ensure hector is prepared   because you are not on the front line  freddie  hector is   bel tells me you're working on another story   it's not ready yet   clarence     rudderless  at least they didn't say it was because you were a woman   perhaps they haven't noticed it yet   don't make me regret my choice  bel   auribus tenere lupum  hmm    grab the wolf by the ears    are you all right   absolutely   is there a single bloody phone here that works  no   we're between the bbc home service and johnny morris in priority  apparently  he's mine   the world service sent him up   he speaks arabic  no harm in being ready  bel   monitoring are sending transcripts of the egyptian broadcasts   i need someone to translate   my man in alexandria  well  he does his best   but it's   it's schoolboy arabic   lix has got a lackey   when you have a president of a middle eastern country angry with half the western world   buying arms off the soviets and whipping up crowds in alexandria   chances are  egypt leads   and westminster's getting a little edgy  tu ne penses pas   find him a desk   i'm sorry   you were unspeakable  freddie   i am your producer  you absolutely cannot talk like that in front of clarence   it's not just you and me  what's wrong with you   i could  of course  bring up your obvious attraction to cary grant   but ignoring that  which i won't   because you are quite frankly out of your mind    i'm not listening   he's slick  mediocre  smug   i stopped listening at  mediocre    why did you not even consider me   because you're too goddamned ugly   this is when you reference my brilliance off camera  my essentiability     not a word    that  without me  you really couldn't go on   i couldn't go on   phone rings  bel rowley   clicking down phone  does yours keep doing this   police report   it still says suicide  freddie   there are scratches all round the paint around the showerhead   like she tried to grip it to pull herself up  like she struggled   everyone struggles when they're in the throes of dying   the body clings to life  second paragraph    compression to the oesophagus  and fracture to second vertebra    it's a seven foot three inch drop from showerhead to base of bath  at best  that's slow asphyxiation   i don't think it'd break your neck  second vertebra  you'd have to hang from a tree or bridge   or by violent force  is this really scientific   she didn't kill herself   they'll say that you fell for a  i made a promise to her    because they tapped into your own  they did  they do   i knew her  i stayed with her family during the war   peter darrall was setting the crosswords in the evening standard every other week   he was using them to send messages   the perforations pick up certain letters   because he's a spy   the last crossword he set was published the day he died   mi5  mi6   maybe   he was killed by a russian looking for this   what does it say   i don't know  i never finish crosswords   seven letters   many set free   possibly an anagram   marvel's all true crime doesn't make you a real detective  doesn't it   they publish the answers the next day  why don't you     i would if i could bloody find it    amnesty    many set    very good   but not good enough to be considered as a frontman for the hour  right  oh  god   it's a fact  moneypenny  and stop calling me that   as your producer  that qualifies me as something more than a secretary  you know i have a story here   no  you don't  not yet  abolition of hanging  house of lords   you know lord elms has an office there   be nice to hector   why   sorry  do you mind   behave  freddie  ignore him   he's a melancholic   and thanking you again   he likes to hoard newspapers  rather like a tramp   no  i like to keep them  because one day they will have their use   this is mr     kish  thomas kish  pretty girl   yes   just need a     yes  of course  sorry  thank you   i didn't know where to put him so i thought you might share  oh  help yourself   isaac   phone rings  bel rowley   clicking on line  murmured conversation  hawley harvey crippen  john christie  ruth ellis    all hanged for very different heinous crimes   but today  a momentous bill already passed in the house of commons  is to be heard in the house of lords which may put an end  to capital punishment in this country for good   all i'm getting is rain  it's like court shoes on parquet   can we try inside   thank you   you know  you always click your heel harder on the third step   no  i don't  yes  you do   heels click  we need to work on your links today  say more  smile less   yes  i hear the newspapers don't like the smile  do you really not read them   front page and sport  i find that normally covers it  incredible  what   i should be interested in the bored bile of some fat hack stuck in fleet street on an expense account   they refer to an absence of intellect  they may be right  it's overrated   you really don't care what they think   i care what you think   four o'clock  in the studio   ron  reel three is fine  thank you  miss rowley   miss rowley  your mother's here   yoo hoo   what about here  well  it's as light as it's probably going to get   hello   if it's pink  it's fish paste   i can't stay much longer  it's madness today   we should have gone to that little italian   ooh  when did you cut your hair   umm     last month  perhaps  i don't remember  platinum would suit you  darling  yes   if i wanted to look like a lady who works the docks   darling  why don't we sit here   i've got to go now  ma  oh  five more minutes   isn't that your editor   producer   how old do you think she is   i don't know   she must be nearly 30    thank you   she looks just like that actress   you know  the one we saw in that thingy   where's the bolshevik  out   how's the broker   banker  he's fine  i expect   i haven't seen him in weeks   how's bill  clive   don't know  don't care   you worry so   is that her mother  oh  god  it is  it's verda rowley   oh  she left her husband   don't stare  darling  sorry   i am quite back on my feet  in fact  it's really rather exciting   where are you staying  cynthia's   she's been marvellous  oh  robert's still appalling   he reminded me i had a daughter with a very nice little flat   oh  please  god  no   just try not to     miss rowley  i must apologise  marnie insists on    yes   carole lesley  hector doesn't agree with me  but you look just like her   the embezzler  have you not seen it   she's terribly good  no  hector hates it when i pop in   no  i don't  but one is just so curious   this is my mother  hello  you must be very proud  hello   that's my babydoll   we have to go   leave   yes  we should go too  darling   babydoll   i'll be 28 in august   why not bel or isabel  the name you christened me   rather than something you'd call a showgirl   the lock's broken  you have to lift the door a little  and then a quick push and you're in   there are some cold chops in the refrigerator  help yourself if you're hungry  i'll be back by nine   i won't forget this  sweetheart   yes  you will   miss rowley     did you make mr madden a cup of tea again this morning   no  well  yeah  but he just smiles at ya and then     do you want to be taken seriously   or for ever be some stupid little marionette fluttering on the arm of every good looking man in the bbc   no  well  the first rule   you don't make tea  right  but  i     you're a very pretty girl but the last thing i need is someone distracting those around you   don't send me back  where  i didn't ask for you   i don't know where to send you back to   like most things in this corporation  people arrive  and you are expected to accept them  no questions asked  personnel   they're on the second floor  it's where all the secretaries come from  miss coulson     how old are you   cooper  it's actually cooper  as in gary   but there's a miss sally cooper down in children's casting  and they were concerned i was going to get her post  how old are you  21    got a distinction in shorthand   the hour is the most exciting posting i have had since i got here   i've been in the mail room since january  that implies you can stick on a stamp  but not keep out my mother  i'm not like them   the rest of them in that typing pool  always on the lookout   i ain't looking for that  i want to be part of something  part of this   and i know i can be really useful and helpful to you  miss cooper   less is more   the bbc   very good   i had a mind to go into broadcasting once   yes  you've done well for yourself  frederick   lord elms  i was hoping to interview you  sir   to get your reaction to the bill  it won't get passed  if that's what you mean   so you voted against it   does it matter  we get the vote we deserve  and the rest can hang   that doesn't make it right   is it on   as in everyday life  the word  right  has no single unequivocal meaning   is the widow of the police officer murdered by a violent attacker  not  right  to demand reasonable justice for her late husband   but is the man falsely convicted and sentenced to be hanged  also not  right  to demand that same reasonable justice   to demand his right to life   in a democracy  the only thing one can be right about is     the right to ask the question   and the real question is   do we live in a democracy       or     under the illusion of one     what sort of a camera is it   auricon   ruthie liked to make little films   i didn't come to the funeral   to ruth's funeral  i didn't know if you'd want me there   you are always welcome  frederick   you always were   she came to see me   she wanted me to help her   and did you   one could argue that swift death  is preferable to a lifetime's imprisonment   one could argue that   mr lyon   lix was looking for you   we did this story last week   and you smiled last week   and then you flicked your eyes up and down  yes  just like that   if it's a short script  learn it   it's this bloody desk   it's not the desk's fault  it's you   the only thing that's stopping you is you   sorry  my mother does this to me   she seemed very nice  that's just her flirting with you   so did your wife    seem very nice   freddie says    oh  mr lyon   he can be quite kind if you just    keep away from you   i don't know why you're so nervous   you're charming and you're effortless and then the minute you turn to look at the camera you just     well  everyone's waiting there for me to be brilliant   i can't just pluck the name of the president of liberia out of the ether   i need to stick to a script  but then when i look down and then i look up again and there you all are standing there  staring back at me   it's bloody terrifying   perhaps mr lyon would have been a better fit   she laughs  how did you get into news   i was about 16   i used to sit in my father's study listening to the wireless   hitler's decision  to leave the league of nations   the most powerful thing i've ever heard   it pulled me out of that drab little room  and into the middle of a crisis  as if i was sitting there with them  the third person at that table   that's how it should be   stand up   they need to see you   they need to know who you are   trust you as they would a friend   they need to hear you talk as i just heard you   a man who does a job that other men would kill to do   and that women want to sit next to at the dinner table because you're the most dangerous man in the room   there you are  lix is looking for you   thank you  freddie   yes  ok  listen to this   the military have moved into the central square in alexandria  they've cordoned off the crowd   nasser's been talking for coming up to an hour  and he doesn't seem like he's stopping   our man in alexandria's leaning out of the window  he's holding up the phone  give us pictures  lix   apparently there are thousands of people  they're waving and cheering   it's like a carnival     i  i can't understand  it's arabic  mr kish   what exactly is nasser saying  this canal is an egyptian canal   it is an egyptian limited company   the canal and then britain forcibly deprived us of our right in it   what's he saying  are we going to war  don't be daft   where's clarence  i don't know  are you listening now   what happens now  i don't know    i don't  umm  i don't know   let me think   we are  we are  we're going to war  we are not going to war  miss cooper   we're carrying on preparing for tomorrow's show  we are taking in our stride the incoming news  that colonel nasser has taken control of this country's most important trade route   we are reorganising and regrouping  lix  freddie  hector  and ron  now   sissy  telephone lines  we

with elms  when do you get it back from the lab   first thing  if mr albert gets a lick on  you have to see it  bel   you have to hear what lord elms said  we run this film    i don't know what we're running tomorrow   but when i decide i'll let you know   i'll come with you  to meet hafiz  it's fine  hector and i can    home affairs desk   this could loosely be considered home affairs with a bit of foreign affairs thrown in     is it just me  or has hector shrunk   i'm sure he was taller   when we first met you couldn't even knot your tie straight  you'd never tried an oyster   personally not much of a loss   been to the theatre  read woolf or wilde   i did that  it's what you do for someone when you believe in them   and you believe in him   i've got  atom     shamble    evolve    freddie     we were hoping to entice you onto the hour   so that you can interrogate me   no  yes  mr hafiz  we would like to bring a balanced view  to rapidly unfolding and sensitive political events  your president has stolen our canal   it hasn't been without provocation   i can just see the headlines tomorrow  grabber nasser   it does have a certain ring to it   freddie  may i apologise   why  he is only saying what the world will say   but they do not know the truth   and what is the truth  mr hafiz   if you come on to our programme  perhaps you will have a chance to tell the country   if i am interviewed by a gentleman   here  let me give you a hand with those   right     you'll need the background  you can't wing it  start with these   you'll need     perhaps a little more than a children's britannica   how do you do it  how do you know exactly the right question to ask   because i'm not afraid of the answers   right  this is good  i've marked the best pages  ignore the last chapter   thank you  this is for bel   not for you   you're still an arse   freddie   do you ever wash up  saucepans  not much   cutlery occasionally   and she won't even make me a cup of tea   i'll

to squeeze yourself into that bloody dress  you'll miss it   darling  please don't become one of those women  who feels the need to have a career and not a life   i'd rather be that woman than waiting for a bloody phone call   ooh  did you not sleep well last night  it always makes you so grumpy   the last thing i want is to sleep  i've woken up   horn blares outside  you should try it  ma   radio

great detail to president nasser so that he should be left in no doubt as to its implications   '  egypt   this chap must not appear on this television     lift bell dings door opens  clarence  i would have told you   mccain already has  they have their spies everywhere   naguib hafiz is a coup  you know it   a man who will be a mouthpiece for nasser  an arab nationalist whom eden sees as a soviet puppet   how can we be impartial if we only tell one side of the story   that is why i am about to tell them that i leave it to the discretion of my producer to decide   but freddie must forgo his interview with lord elms  elms complained   freddie was seen speaking to him in a corridor in the house of lords   there are things said in grief that a man may later regret   you are must tell freddie the film blew   pick your battles  bel   mr fendley  mr mccain's here   thank you   when did you     when did you first become aware of president nasser's intentions to seize the canal   don't work so hard  go again   you be mr hafiz  and i'll be you   westminster is concerned  i wanted to illuminate the situation for you   i  um    thank you   i insisted it wasn't just anyone coming down to talk to you   i realise this is all very new for you  but you cannot go ahead with this interview tonight   but i can  mr mccain   one must be aware that politicians are very devious   the arab world has a rich literary tradition   now  this is a very dangerous mix   a politician who understands the power of a good narrative could hardly be called impartial   and that is why we intend to interrogate him   you joined nasser on a recent trip to moscow  would you care to comment   see  now is when you build   well    i'm sorry  mr hafiz  i didn't catch that     was it in order to discuss the arms deal  the arms deal was with czechoslovakia   the arms were soviet  mr hafiz  how long have you been planning to seize the suez canal   would he know that  of course  now you     i would very much like to help you  miss rowley   now  there are many powerful people who will be very unhappy  if you allow mr hafiz on your programme this evening   i really feel it is my duty to protect you  i don't need your protection   perhaps if the programme was scripted  and we saw a transcript prior to broadcast   then it could hardly be called a live interview   if you proceed with this reckless behaviour   i cannot guarantee what our response in government will be  quite frankly   i run a news programme   it's my job to cover the news  that is what i intend to do tonight   anything else is reckless   and now if you'll excuse me   i have a show about to go on air that i must attend to  it must be those maternal instincts again   auribus tenere lupum      look it up   sorry  this is my dad   he's testing the line  the engineers were tied up putting in more lines on the sports desk upstairs   phone rings  hello   clicking on line he can't work out what the click is  on the line   but he will do  right  thank you   very good  carry on   we shall march forward to political and economic independence  all right   will you be much longer with that  mr kish  not much longer   if we look back  we do so only to demolish the relics of oppression  servility  exploitation     he's good  yes  he's the only englishman i've met  who can switch from the classical arabic to the egyptian vernacular without batting an eyelid   thirty minutes  ladies and gentlemen  30 minutes   sissy  i'm      freddie   your elms film blew   there was a problem with the sound  mr nelson said he could clean it up   i'm sorry  you're doing that funny thing with your eyes again   bel   everyone needs to get to the studio  we're live in 30 minutes   places  everybody  please   you set  yep  watch the smile   makes you look like crippen  was he a good looking bastard too   mr hafiz  thank you  this way  please   parcel  mr lyon  just arrived   eyes ahead  isaac   it's fine   i'll be there  fine   do you have everything you need   i see we are being watched   always  this way  mr hafiz   it's just you talking to that boy sitting in his father's study   stand by  studio     five  four  three   two  one     fade up vision  go   good evening and welcome to the hour   the most important  we lead with the story that dominates   president nasser's seizing of the suez canal company   to shed some light on this growing crisis  we are joined  by one of the leading supporters of egypt's president  mr naguib hafiz   good evening  thank you for joining us  thank you for inviting me   what is your opinion of president nasser's decision to take over the suez canal company   the canal is situated in egyptian territory and it has quite simply reverted back to egyptian control   well  if i may i correct you  mr hafiz   the canal is owned by the french and british suez canal company   it is theft   i prefer reclamation  well  you can be certain the british public won't perceive it that way   britain has for too long  behaved like a distant relative of egypt who believes that he's still entitled to the family silver   you off   till we meet again   yes   your country has been sold a fiction by an impotent prime minister  surrounded by all his cronies   and by a corrupt and deceitful government   the british empire is over   so you are accusing prime minister eden of weakness  worse  of lying   of selling to the british public a fiction   and is president nasser hoping to build an empire of his own   are there any plans to enlist soviet support for this new empire   is president nasser declaring war on the british empire  mr hafiz   the country is waiting  mr hafiz  i must press you   tell me you will come this weekend   i know you think you're onto something with ruth elms   i am  obvious as hell he wasn't in love with her   mr kish  no one told me to expect you in   didn't they  what do i do   just watch him  you don't know what you've got yourself into   and now you know too much    e mail subtitling bbc co uk
