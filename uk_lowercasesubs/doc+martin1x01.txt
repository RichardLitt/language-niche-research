downloaded from   you've got a problem   this is our district nurse governor  hilary richards   and bob matthias  the general practice adviser to the pct   oh  and louisa glasson  the lay member     well  shall we go through    yeah   yeah   any further questions   apart from   what have we done to deserve so eminent an applicant   eh     good  so       sorry  can i just ask     how would you describe your interpersonal skills   i've been a surgeon for 12 years   ran a team of senior registrars at st john's  think that speaks for itself   the image of a surgeon is someone who deals with cases rather than individuals   bodies rather than people   my work is with the patients  that's nothing but dealing with bodies   people   if you want to be a gp in our village  social skills and a good bedside manner are essential   louisa  i think that dr ellingham is more than qualified    to alienate people  perhaps   nothing i've seen of him so far convinces me that he's a proper replacement for dr sim   martin   mart   you cross the line just once in portwenn  and       will you stop that    is the vision a little blurred in that eye   yes     fixed  semidilated pupil  bit of pain    sometimes  what   it's acute glaucoma     you're kidding    no  you should see an eye specialist today    martin   excuse me   here's to dr ellingham  our new man in portwenn    dr ellingham

   it is urgent     what seems to be the problem    well  it's a difficult issue   l i suppose a cup of tea is out of the question  is it   yes   well     it's a problem in the chest department   a matter of excess weight   right  fewer carbohydrates  more protein  get some exercise     are we done    no  no  no  no  it it's     breasts   it it seems to be     it's not unusual  perfectly normal for men      normal      to have a little breast tissue    it's a disgrace     quite possibly  do you have another problem    what     is there anything else the matter with you    is that all you have to say   men have breast tissue  men even account for some breast cancers  it's perfectly normal   wow   right   the medical term is gynaecomastia   there can be a number of causes   genetic  environmental   could it be something to do with the water  there have been rumours   i sincerely hope not or we'll all be needing a bra  if you'd like to lie down   now  look here  i'm a respected member of this community     i did not come here to be ridiculed by you    oh  come on     a local man would have known better    he's dead and you had no appointment   for your information  i did

mouse  those lanes have bags of room   you'll stay for chicken   you know  i still can't get used to the idea of you as a surgeon   now you only have to get used to the idea of me as a gp   last time you were here you got a splinter in your finger and cried     i was seven    you were 11  and you wet the bed   not exactly the stuff of which    of which     surgeons are made  hm   right  hang on to this one   there you go   i always hoped that you'd grow up not looking like your father  but there you go   you as stubborn as he is  too  yes  of course you are     have you heard from him    no   god forgive me for cursing my own brother  but he is a bloody idiot   no  we'll have that one     well  go on    auntie joan  no  i     oh  martin  for heaven's sake     right  there we go   well  come on     so  what went wrong    with what   well  swanky surgeon in london one minute  gp in portwenn the next     you're here    oh  don't be ridiculous   i've been here for 30 years and i haven't seen you  was it a woman     no  it wasn't a woman    lack of a woman   i saw two practices  couldn't decide between them  then i saw portwenn        what   when you talk to the locals you might try and sound a bit more pleased to be here   actually  l l l i can't stop  i just remembered  i just wanted to say hello  anyway   martin  martin  you've got to eat   i do have a surgery to set up and i've got to arrange for a plumber   i'll send the large boys round  they'll fix up your plumbing for you   i'll tell you this  no woman will fix your plumbing up if you go round looking that pale   you need to eat    oh  dear  oh  dear   who put that lot in for you  doc  eh     whole lot have to come out    yeah  yeah   i know you've got to make money  and to you i'm a down from town londoner  but i'm not an idiot   hang on to your hat  doc  i'm just pulling your chain  that's one of ours  innit   have it fixed for you in a jiffy  no charge     thank you    probably just a new tap  i'll try the washer   yeah  you try the washer  son   here  doc  i'm not one to criticise  but you wanna relax   down here we just go with the flow   right     go away  go away  i've nothing for you   get    go away     definitely bodmin   bodmin  that's an endearing local term for  barmy  right   well  someone who's bodmin is    well  it's kinda like     well  the thing is    ok  now  what happens is       treat yourself to a noun    it's someone who wanders on the moor   auntie annie  she went bodmin  but she never went near the moor  do you remember     going bodmin is      i think i get the picture   unless it came from the old asylum in bodmin town  or it could be a literary reference   what are you going on about  boy   old doc martin don't want a reference  no  he just wants to know what it means   daphne du maurier paints bodmin moor as a gothic symbol of murder and madness   all granite skies and howling winds   you'll be going bodmin yourself in a minute  boy     dad  not that one  no    yeah   try it again now  this happens all the time  soon have it sorted   but where's the    the bloody    whatsitcalled     you know      i can help you with this term   the word you're searching for is  stopcock    now  not many people know that there are four kinds of stopcock       will you lend a hand    i can't work in this     well  why don't you go home  then    it's greg for elaine   who left the door open  get out  whose is this sodding dog     tell him you saw me and barry kissing    right     mouth open  with tongues    water damage  that's a beast all on its own   hold that and shut up  you  get off the telephone and find the stopcock   and you  either get back to delabole  wherever that may be  and don't come back   or go and find a mop and work out how to use it   and as for you     oh  er       stray dog   doc martin  it's nice to meet you finally   i don't care whether you think i'm lonely or bodmin or how far it is to delabole   it's just a dog     ah  hello  you must be dr ellingham  excellent   susan brading  welcome to portwenn  you must come up to the applegarth and see us     thank you    actually  i need to come and see you too     i'm not set up    of course not  it's a repeat prescription   i'll see you when you're ready  shall i tell you something     you're exactly what this community needs    there's one or two people might disagree   nonsense  is that the time  my husband will kill me     you couldn't dash off a prescription right now    no  i'm afraid i can't do that     shouldn't have asked    not a problem   it's just that old dr sim didn't care much for the rule book   from the state of his surgery  he didn't care much for hygiene either   it's just for some of my cream  you know  ladies of a certain age  couldn't you     then i'll see you when you're properly set up    hrt cream     any problems with it    happy as a sand girl  whatever a sand girl is     brading  b r a d       i  n g  yes   ok   martin   come and give me a hand   you settled in all right     i asked bert large to call on you    yeah  he did already     oh  jolly good    not necessarily  no   well  he's worth knowing  apart from anything else  he's a fount of local knowledge   yeah  i bet   her name is louisa glasson  by the way  the teacher     yeah  we already met    but not successfully     did she say something    no   but you were skulking  and nobody skulks after a successful meeting  right  come on   just for the record  i wasn't skulking  i didn't know she worked there  i just spotted her     elaine  can you get me the notes on mrs susan brading of the applegarth  please     why    because i asked you to  elaine   it's lady brading  actually  you remember old sir john   did you hurt that dog  i love dogs   yeah  i love them too  i love the way they smell  love the way they bite you   dogs are the best     susan brading    thank you   lady brading always had to call him sir john   i don't think she cared  but he was a stickler for it  even when it was just the two of them   especially when it was just the two of them   how much hrt cream can one woman use   they reckon that she was calling him sir john the night he died  if you catch my drift   these dates can't be right  elaine     does susan brading know gilbert spencer    know him  only in the biblical sense     do you mean she gave birth to him in a stable    they got married a few years back     lovely wedding  whole village was invited    greg got off with a slapper from dorset     will you get over it    no   the biblical sense  have you not heard of that  doc   it's like  i love al  but not in the biblical sense  cos he's my son  if you see what i mean     i'm surprised you've not heard of that  doc    shut up     colonel   colonel spencer   you're not my doctor  i'm seeing a chap in wadebridge in the morning     right  then  i'll talk to your wife    she is out   she just told me in town that she's coming home   can't help that  she's not here now   fine   right  we're going to talk  or rather i'm going to talk and you're going to listen   then if you want to go to wadebridge and inflict your ex military routine on some poor sod   i'll drive you myself  but at least i'll have delivered the diagnosis you asked me for   get out    the three of us need to talk   please     you haven't told your wife  have you    doctor   darling  you must be starving  poor poppet   dr ellingham  would you like to stay for a bite    you're late  again   darling  silly  i told you  i was shopping     did you get the moss killer    oh  darling   i'm such a fool  i completely forgot   yes   i'm becoming forgetful in my old age  doctor  is there a cure   no   listen  i've been updating your patient notes  your use of oestrogen cream  it's excessive   perhaps i use more than it says on the pack  makes me feel chipper   but there can be side effects   and to be honest   how can i put this    we find it smoothes the works   well  it looks like rain     i think i'd better tend to the garden     sit down     what    sit down     your husband came to me with a complaint    what     are you all right  what is it    it's nothing  really   all right  i'll tell her  your husband has gynaecomastia   that's a condition where a man develops chest tissue     breasts    yes    ah   the vest in bed  why didn't you tell me     not as attractive as i used to be    nonsense   i want to suggest that there's a connection between the cream and this condition   oestrogen is a female hormone   it's possible that during intercourse some may have transferred and  erm     gilbert  i'm so sorry   oh  dear  it's not your fault   i need to do a little bit more research  but i'm not the first to suspect a connection   right  i'll leave you two to       you know where i am if you want me    thank you  doctor   afternoon  elaine  you're looking efficient   enjoy your tea   what's wrong with you   nothing  the day got better   patient waiting   no  there isn't  because  as you know  i'm not open for business yet   there's still a patient waiting   you'd better be dying   i think i'm growing breasts   oh  no   oh  god  it's serious  innit   oh  oh  no  nothing to do with you   i had a theory  you've just proved it wrong  let me have a look     i've been drinking the water    i'm sure   there's something wrong with the water  no one's admitting it  but look       lady brading  i've been looking for you    we've been looking for you   caroline here is our local radio star     call me caro    she's in charge of prize giving   i assumed you'd give the prizes for fancy dress     it's usually the doctor's task    i just wanted a word with you   if i don't get inside and toss a few salads  the committee will hound me out of portwenn     that's interesting    glad you like it   it's better than that tosh over there   a lot of old firewood loosely glued to some litter in the name of arts and crafts   i like that  sombre   thanks for looking after my stall  bob     who's the best  class six     yeah   right  where's the eye patches  everyone with eye patches put your     ah     your diagnosis was right  they've got me on drops     what    they've got me on drops   they're beta blockers  it should clear up in a couple of weeks  if not  see your doctor   i would  but i got off to a bad start with him   oh  no  your doctor's a professional  am i your doctor   yeah  i should have told you i lived in portwenn     so how are you finding us    irritating   apart from the primary school teacher  who's  erm  a pirate  it seems     you're not at all like i thought you were      i've got to go   colonel  i wanted a quick word with you about your gynaecomastia     please    it seems it wasn't your wife's cream   not here  for god's sake   fine     what makes you think it wasn't the cream    well  there's been an unrelated case   bloody water  i thought so  who was it     i can't tell you    local fellow   young lad  surfer type  probably wished too hard for the perfect    swell    good god   it's probably not what it looks like     what are you doing here    nothing     gilbert    don't come near me      thank you  everybody    bloody hell     gilbert    susan     you told him about me    well  that's not     well  at least we know where your tits came from   perfect timing  here's our new doctor  dr

our new doctor  dr ellingham   disappointed the boys and girls who       you missed the show at the pub last night    really     gilbert got drunk and tried to kill ross    what  did you have to intervene   i took the view that a lobster is not a particularly lethal weapon   he says he's divorcing susan     you depressed    oh  no   i've antagonised the village  buggered up a marriage and crashed my car   why would i be depressed   i'm depressed   dr sim wanted to give me something  i'm trying the homeopathic route  so i know how you feel   i've wanted to drive my car into a bog sometimes   i didn't drive into a bog  somebody came at me  and not for the first time since i've been here   see  i've had that too   sometimes it's like everybody's coming at you     i thought you were gonna      i know   he got out   had a good lawyer   what the hell's going on   doc martin  sir  now  don't worry     it's all under control    delivery for ellingham   sometimes happens when we

face it  you piss people off wherever you go   couldn't stand the sight of you myself for the first few years of med school   i'm just saying  what are you gonna gain by moving on   how will it help the people here if they lose the best medic they're ever likely to see  because of some stupid     oh  dan  can you please just     so why don't we just sit tight  and hope all this just blows over     eh  mate    no   sorry  i'll put things right as best i can  but then i'm calling it a day   thank you   thanks for coming   i just wanted to say  i could have handled things better     i'm the one

won't talk  to be honest  i can't face him at the moment   what about ross   keeps calling  i've told him it's all over   long letter   but he won't accept it     he'll get over it    yes  he's a boy   today he thinks his heart is broken  tomorrow there'll be good waves   he'll surf  he'll forget   and then in a month or two  there'll be a sultry 19 year old  who'll let him enjoy her breasts without giving him a set of his own   you're going to have to talk to them both  you know that  don't you   i don't think this is a good idea     i said i'd talk to you  not her    colonel   darling
