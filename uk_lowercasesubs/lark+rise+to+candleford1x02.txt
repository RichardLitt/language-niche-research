miss lane once said that every secret  eventually sees the light of day in candleford    we had no idea of the length that mrs macey would go to   to protect her son from her own troubled past   oozin'  simply oozin' with goodness   or what a lark rise son might do to try and save his mother from herself   she'll have a sunday off soon  now she's settled in     how much  jerry    penny each

and you won't step a foot outside of the debtors' prison  till every penny is settled   episode 2  transcript  evarin transcript uk  sync  moochie  shock of it might've done for a weaker man's heart   what more can i say  but 'i'm sorry ' thomas  it was an accident   is it an accident the rascal has no father to keep him in hand   a gentleman's gentleman must go where his master travels   god intended for boys to have fathers  mrs macey   when there is none  the devil gets to work   well  i say there ain't no husband  and there weren't one when she turned up five years ago with that child in tow   and no wonder with a face as sour as that   lips like a hen's backside   struck down on the street for the whole town to see   hat's an affront tothe very uniform   it was a child's prank  thomas  not an assault on the post office   the boy's a miscreant  something ought to be done with him   zillah  the counter has been spoiled with you enough for today   and mrs macey's face isn't sour  it's sad   yes  ma'am   and anyone who cares to look can see that freddy is not a miscreant     he simply needs a little guidance   freddy     'my dearest  dear caroline'    oh  'dearest dear' is good   he always had a honey tongue on him  my walter   it's no wonder i spend half my life pregnant   'the seas have been kind to us  and we've made swift passage'   oh  just get to where he says when he'll be home again   'my darlin' dear  i've signed myself up for another passage to australia '  'so i won't be setting eyes on you for another six months and more '  i'm sorry  mrs arless     would you like me to continue reading    no  that's all right  little laura   i never let such things worry me before  and i don't intend to start now   mrs arless  i was sorry to hear your news   well  you won't catch me with my face under my feet about it   i've a thing to tell 'em  which means it won't come to no court   there's a disturbed mind that can dream up a creature like that  i say   it's the wood tree man   it's boys for you  my brother's always imagining such things   that's for you  laura   to hang up in your room  by your bed   let's see how natural that is  looking down at you in the dead of night  young miss   oh  freddy  you haven't been in the woods again  have you   come on  let's get you in the bath   there's young freddy  there   there's no one to keep that boy in hand   a mother's a fine thing   it's all too obvious mrs macey's not up to the task   what woman is   the little man can only get worse with no father around  to give him a proper steer on life   perhaps  thomas     you could do that for him   me  nah   that's not my place to go meddling in    that ain't my responsibility   i suppose i could be an example to the boy   'tis a noble endeavour to pass on some discipline and devotion to a child   it's not everyone has the moral character to impart it  is it   i'll see what i can do   good morning   if you're tied up  ladies  perhaps i should call back later   i was only after a few inches of lace   miss lane  i wonder whether i might ask your advice   which of these should i purchase   oh  blue   i always seem to dream more exotic dreams in blue   but the blue is so plain   i require something altogether more alluring   then you must go for the purple  your ladyship   and leave myself and miss pearl and miss ruby with our exotic dreams   isn't that so  ladies   i can't read them   what do they mean   what it means  alf  is that when your ma goes to court   there's a real chance they'll send her to the debtors' prison   what are we gonna do  mr timmins   her only hope is to take some money along to the court with her   offer a payment and promise to keep the instalments coming   but she ain't got no money   you make sure you keep your wages from her until you get to the court   at least that's something   my rheumatism don't like this damp night air   couldn't we fetch the last few buckets in the morning   that needs to be collected in the moonlight  you old duffer     good night  laura    good night  ma'am   looking at caroline's heartache and mrs macey's troubles with freddy   both of them cos of the man they married   i don't think i should want a husband at all   like you  miss lane   who ever chooses to fall in love  laura   now then  when we walk down the street  freddy   what do we want people to think when they look upon us   respect  they must say to themselves  'there goes a man '  so we must hold ourselves upright   that's a good lad  yep   keep yourself up  keep your back straight  not like that   nice and straight    up  up     morning  ladies   when your neighbours have a nose for scandal   the fear in your eyes is enough to arouse the suspicions   it's dan     my husband   come inside  we'll discuss this in private   laura  please tell zillah she is to go upstairs and turn my room out   it's from the prison authorities   dan has escaped   oh  this is a sorry kettle of fish   it's unheard of to do upstairs work in the morning   i'm in a bit of a fix  laura  mrs macey won't be able to take her letters out   i don't know what i shall do about today's delivery   perhaps  if you thought i could manage it     might i have a try  ma'am    what a good idea   mrs macey will need our support   as you heard  she has had some bad news concerning her husband   i thought he was abroad   he may have been at one time  but not any more   put this letter into sir timothy's private post bag to take with you   and laura  i know i can count on you to keep what you witness to yourself   yes  ma'am   right    there   yeah  that's grand   there     mrs macey's troubles had somehow become a blessing for me   i knew on that first morning delivering the post   that i had found my place in the world   you get your dog away from me   the sign there says  'no trespassers'   i can read  i meant no harm   the blossom's so beautiful around here   all the enclosures are barred   you're not supposed to pick flowers on sir timothy's estate   i had no idea that picking flowers was a hanging offence in these parts   let me give them back to you   well  it's just the pheasants are still sittin'     and it's my job  as assistant gamekeeper   to see that they're not disturbed   then i shan't disturb you or your pheasants any longer   well  it's just     there'sjust too much laxity round here   too much laxity   no wonder you need such a fierce dog  i had to sever all contact   i did it for freddy's sake   what would it do to the poor child to know what his father had done   do you suppose dan has escaped in order to find freddy   no  that's not possible   he had no idea we moved to candleford   you've had no contact with him     no one in your family    no     i have kept in touch with his sister   dan has escaped and put himself into terrible trouble   he must have a reason   and i think we must believe that the reason is freddy   you're quite a boy  freddy   your father must be proud of you  is he   my pa's a gentleman's gentleman and he's travelling all around the world   is that right   where is he now  then   ma says he's catching tigers in spain  which is a very long way away   that's right  it is   quite a man  your pa  ain't he   ma says he'll come home and tell me all about his adventures  and bring me presents from all over the world   you're a lucky boy to have such a pa as that   why are you hiding   you get some strange folks in the woods  freddy   best to keep out of view till you know they're not villains  eh   i can't face telling freddy  i can't do it   perhaps you could think of it as a kindness   it s not easy  i know   but under the circumstances   it could be best to prepare him for whatever might follow     good morning  mrs arless    that's a merry bit of luck  sir   you being on the road here as i'm on my way to the post office     and why's that    because of who i am  sir   and who you are  and me coming into your court this next week     mrs arless      only  since we've happened to meet like this and     you can see the way of things with me  what the child coming and all     i'm sorry  mrs arless  but if you were hoping to discuss your case     oh  no  sir  not discuss nothing  no   but  as i'm so close to my time     it would be improper of me to enter into any conversation with you   yes  sir  no sir  but now you've seen i'm expecting   i can't go to prison  so there'll be no need of a hearing   whatever you have to say about the charges   and any mitigating circumstance  you will have your chance  to do so at the appropriate place  the court room  good day to you   walk on   what i'm gonna pass on to you  freddy   is a priceless treasure  sit yourself down there   now then       that's the wood tree man    yes  yes   the reason you're getting yourself into fights   and every manner of trouble  is that you lack direction   you have no faith to guide you       he hides in the woods    are you paying attention   we are hereto enlighten you  not to waste time on such     grim fantasies  now     prayer   the lord jesus christ taught us how to pray   it must be something quite terrible since dear mrs macey came  hurrying into the post office in such a     well         a hurry   and looking so frightfully fearful of whatever it was   how considerate of you  miss pearl  miss ruby   to come enquiring after mrs macey in such a     well  a hurry   and her bringing up the boy all on her own these past five years     if we could be of any assistance     with whatever the trouble was   how neighbourly  indeed   but we already have all the help we require   was it stamps that you wanted today  ladies   er  yes   miss lane had taught me that the post office was the keeper of local secrets   i was about to learn that some of them were our own   perhaps you would like to go home on sunday   can i   i was going to suggest it anyway   and i need you to continue with mrs macey's round for a while longer   you will have to ask your parents' permission   is her husband ill  ma'am   i'm afraid dan macey is not  and never has been  a gentleman's gentleman   he was a bookmaker   i have mrs macey's permission to tell you this  laura   these past five years  dan macey has been in prison   and we must tell anyone who enquires about mrs macey  that her mother is unwell  do you understand   of course  miss lane   what did he do   that's the bottom and the top of it   caroline's going to jail and ain't nothing to be done   well     we'll see about that   ma  why does queenie get her water from the stream in the woods   she'll be making her mead   beekeepers have secret recipes   why do they   because when queenie was taught how to make mead   there were ways of concocting the recipe that can put a spell on it   course  that's only superstition   for a man to be locked away in prison for nearly five years     it must have been a most despicable crime  mustn't it  sir timothy   it's not the kind of penalty i deal out at my monthly assizes   it would have been the darkest of deeds  wouldn't you say  sir timothy   miss ruby  miss pearl  why in heaven would you trouble  your unblemished minds with such disagreeable considerations   it seems our local churchgoers  have been plucking at mrs macey's feathers this morning   yes  i'm afraid it's on everyone's lips  dorcas   they've established that mr macey is in prison  but that's all they know   we should have realised that every secret eventually sees the light of day  in candleford   how do you think word got out   i've told no one about it  only laura   well  she is young   you might like to add a lemon there  queenie   or a few bay leaves for the taste   folk who add any old thing to honey don't deserve to keep bees   you just keep your eye on the lane  make sure no one comes   i know what's to go in here   just smelling that makes a fella thirsty   do you suppose your last brew of mead is ready yet  queenie  my dear   oh  i only want a sup for my rheumatism   no magic charm's going to waste on a wastrel like you   i know who's in need of that first sip   caroline   now  lizzie         you know where alf's hid his wages  don't you   you tell your ma where it is   your ma knows best   a good dance always cheers me up   this wood tree man         he isn't make believe  is he   bees  bees  look who's coming   boy  ain't you grown  gal   that'll be all that fine candleford food they're feeding you   good morning  mrs turrill   i was queenie before you left and i'm queenie now   ain't no call for airs and graces here  gal     pa    why  laura  laura     quite the prodigal daughter    ethel     nothing seems to have changed    why should it change   we haven't killed a fatted calf  we hadn't one handy   but your mother's cooked her best fowl to a turn  especially for you   i expect you're used to better than a bit of poultry now   miss lane is especially fond of the best food   so there's always treats on the table   we sit and read together in the evenings   you wouldn't believe someone could have so many books   so is it all the bettermost people that come into your post office   one gentleman farmer asked miss lane   'where's that charming young gal of yours today '  'charmingyoung gal'  now there's something   and miss lane takes buttermilk baths  and puts petals in her face water   that must be pleasant for her   and you'd say if the work was hard on you   i'm enjoying it so much  ma   i'm learning such a lot from miss lane   i'm glad to hear it     and i've being doing a delivery    a postal round    one ofthe postwomen is unable to work due to a family tragedy     so i took out the letters    on your own   miss lane sent you out with the delivery   and i finished on time   miss lane was very pleased with me  so she said that i could continue   but i'm to ask your permission   well  i don't think that will be possible  laura   you're too young  you're just a girl   she's helping miss lane out in an emergency  emma   yes  i understand that   but you can't carry on with it after the end ofthe week  laura   but i enjoyed it so much  ma   you're my daughter  and i have given you my answer   i've given you my reasons  and that is what you will tell miss lane   we don't need to sit here bickering   i mean  listen to that   you can fetch alfie and we'll have a bit of a tune     bye    bye  lad   alice   you go away  and you leave us alone   i shall tell them you were here  do you understand   i shall send them after you   alice    alice  alice   i can't bear what i did to you and freddy   i can't bear not having the chance to tell you how sorry i am   come on  alfie   you always love to play for us   how's it going to help your ma  for you to be feeling so downhearted on her behalf   where'd you get jumped up talk like that from   and why are you snapping at me  when all i want is for you to join me   i'm only home for today   i'd enjoy it more if you were there   come on  alfie     for me   let's have some more beer   there you are     more beer    what have you done     oh      the money's gone  ain't it   my wages         gone on beer     well    y y you      they'll lock you away for certain   why couldn't you have just waited   why   why should i take a care  eh   what have i got   but a few words on a piece of paper   i've got another little one on the way and no man at my side   come on  lizzie  come on   that's not all lost   candleford might have their modern laws and their courts   but we lark rise folk have still got the old country ways   i can't say no more  but this   your ma  will have the benefit of things beyond this world working on her side   i didn't know how much i missed the feel of your breath on my face   when i feel your eyes on me it's like no time has passed   nothing else matters   being here with you     i could forget our troubles     for a moment   it was always that way  wasn't it   you talk and i lose sight ofthe truth   but it does matter   this moment isn't enough     alice    no  no   i must think of freddy   why could you not just leave us alone    you think i haven't tortured myself with that question  every morning when i open my eyes   freddy can't go his whole life without knowing   you fill his head with lies   you tell him his pa is that man in the photograph   well  i'm not  am i  not any more   freddy was stood here talking to his father   and he didn't know who i was   now i've lost my son     so i might as well tell him the truth    no   no  you must go   you leave us alone   she ain't got the money to offer the courts now  that's likely the end of it   but pa  can't you go down there with her   explain the way things are with mrs arless   and you suppose i can afford to lose a day's wages   what's caroline to lose  and alf   and the little ones   you always brought me up to believe in the importance of being folks together   my own words coming back at me  huh   i might've known you'd get too smart for me   all those books you've been devouring   i'll talk to your ma about it  that's all i can promise   what've i done  what have i ever done   oh  laura  the most awful thing has come about   poor mrs macey  it's all over the town about her husband   so i came here to warn you    well  ask you   you don't know how this might've happened  do you   there you are   so fresh he'll just about jump in the pot and pull the lid down on himself   poor fellow  did he make the mistake of showing too much laxity   i should have apologised for my dog charging up on you like that   your dog wasn't nearly as rude as his owner   but since your peace offering is just about my favourite dish   i expect i'll get over it   good  well  i'll be sure and tell sir timothy that   our squire regularly sends one over for miss lane   jugged hare is her one weakness     miss lane  about mrs macey's round      thank you  zillah   i did sleep well last night   feather pillows are my one weakness     i spoke with my ma      that will have to wait  laura   i have a somewhat more serious consideration to address   i've been waiting for your return so i could raise this matter   i would like to say that  unfortunately   there is no longer any need for me to keep up this pretence about mrs macey   it seems her secret is out   and i am sorry to say  that it can only have been revealed by someone in this household   would any of you care to comment on this   laura     did you discuss this matter with anyone     no  ma'am    ma'am   i i i    i believe i may know something about  how this unhappy circumstance came about   go on   well  i    i overheard you and the young miss  discussing mrs macey's distressing circumstance   and you happened to tell half the town about it   oh  no  miss lane   i wasjust having a word or two with one of the neighbours   and  erm  then it was on the lips of  every heartless gossip in candleford  ma'am   you can take this food away  i've lost my appetite   i shall have to consider what i am to say to poor mrs macey   and i will need to decide about your position here  zillah   oh  caroline     the thing i can't seem to get clear in my head  is  do i tell the little uns what this all means   it'll be a shock to them if you just vanish  and alf has to tell them what's happened to you   but that'll put fear in their little heads  if i tell 'em   and things might still turn out     somehow   no one here will let your children go to sleep without a bite to eat  caroline   why do i do it  emma   other wives have men who go away to work  and they don't go looking for ruin round every corner   why do i have to do this to my babies   morning  ladies     thank you and good day    good day   miss ruby  miss pearl   i have come to ask for your assistance on a rather delicate matter   how can we possibly be of help to you  miss lane   what i was hoping was   since mrs macey has been suffering such a difficult time   it occurred to me you might make a show of friendship to her   and why would we do that   your sensitivity  as esteemed members of the community   would make a very good example to the rest of the town   do you think so  dorcas   i'm sure your respected position would guarantee it   and little freddy will need some compassion from all of us   the child can hardly be held to blame  can he   you are right  to say we must consider our good name in this matter  miss lane   how would our clientele look upon us publicly condoning a brutal criminal   but mrs macey has committed no crime   her husband is locked up  and the woman has deliberately concealed it from those of us who trusted her   perhaps she was afraid her neighbours would not show her  the understanding she and her child might need   or is it more likely she wished to hide her own shame   if there shame to be found in candleford   i assure you it has not been brought on us by mrs macey   is that so   and is it something to be proud of  marrying a murderer   manslaughter  if i may be allowed to correct you   it is my belief  ladies  that the worse the crime   the more dreadful the circumstances are  the more mrs macey deserves our backing   how much more respectful it would have been  had you not turned your nose up at us  when we came to you to you to offer our help   i remember  ma'am  when this was your room   how many times have i sat here to dry your tears   it's little freddy's tears that must concern us now   would you like me to get on with the jugged hare  ma'am   zillah's jugged hare'll put flesh on your bones   i suppose it should be cooked   whether i have an appetite for it is another matter   why do you think i made this life here  do you think i wanted this   do you think i wanted all the secrets and the pretence and the constant fear   i did it for freddy   but you've made it impossible and our life in candleford is in ruins   there's no hiding it any more   freddy's gonna find out   you're going to move away again   do i have a choice   i can't let that happen  i can't bear the thought   i have to go   i love my son   and i love you  alice   well  you threw away the right to that love when you killed a man   it's no wonder the boy's always in trouble   his father a criminal  locked up for five years and more   a murderer     the boy's known nothing of his father  thomas  so  er   how's he been an influence on him   i'm only saying  i'm only thinking  i'm only wondering     is it in the blood   well  maybe we should run the boy out of town   what do you think  thomas   mud on your boots there  freddy   come on  let me show you how to clean them up good   miss lane  i saw mrs macey out in the woods today   and there was something about her that struck me as odd   i just thought i should tell you   thank you  laura  you were right to tell me   what is it  ma'am   whatever it is  i expect it will come to light soon enough   we must trust that  whatever struggles mrs macey is going through     she will find a way out of them    yes  ma'am   zillah has been with me for many years   i would not care to lose her   but it will do her conscience the world of good to make her wait a little while  before i let her off the hook   that's it  and spit     brush  spit     brush  when we're done  they're gonna shine like ninepence   a man is not a man without a polish on his boots  that puts the very stars to shame   you're a good lad  spit     brush   tell your ma she's to come now  queenie's waiting for her     miss lane    come in   please  sit down   i wanted to thank you for everything that you have done for freddy and me         but i have decided that we must leave candleford   when will you go     tomorrow morning    so suddenly   i won't have my child pointed at   or talked about like that  i won't do it to him   of course   you must do what's best for him   if there's anything i can do to help you     that's not what you truly think  is it   you have no idea what this feels like   this could destroy freddy   what his father has done and what the whole town is saying about him     you have no idea what it feels like   no  i don't   i have no right to judge you   but i know that you went out into the woods   i know that   i know you are in a great deal of torment   but i believe with all my heart  that moving to another town will not relieve you of your terrible burden   i saw him  in the woods   he's here   i spoke with him   he only wants to see his family   it's all my doing because     i broke off all contact  i     i wanted to be done with the past  but now it won't let me be   what can i do now   what can i do   face this   all of it  as a family   you must make dan face this   whoever takes the first drink from a new batch of mead   there's no bad luck can touch you for a whole day  the clock round   and with you going to court tomorrow  caroline     here you are  sup it up   look what you done  you duffer   is that bad luck now   that's the charm of it gone upside down  for certain it is   here  look   there's still a few drops left in it   oh  you drink that up  caroline  that's better than nothing   that's macey   that's him  all right   it's her husband  the murderer   come through to the kitchen  dan   i dare say you are in need of a hot drink   is the water boiling  zillah   laura  run to the manor and fetch sir timothy     tell him miss lane said it's urgent    yes  ma'am   laura  dear  who was that  is that poor mrs macey's husband   perhaps you would like to clean up and shave  dan   where's freddy   thomas has taken freddy out on his round   how are we gonna do this  how are we gonna tell him   it seems  ladies and gentlemen  that the post office is closed   perhaps you could call back this afternoon   mr macey  am i correct to understand you wish to surrender yourself  to be held here in candleford  until the prison authorities in dartmoor can be notified   i'm here  aren't i   i will ensure they know that you willingly gave yourself up  and ask for that to be taken into account     miss lane  could you send a telegram    of course   there is a holding cell at the court house   if you would care to walk across there with me   but what about freddy  i want to see freddy   you will see freddy   well  i don't want him to see me in no cell   as you saw  mr macey  there is quite a crowd gathering outside   we can't let him come here like this  we have no choice  dan   and so dan macey did as miss lane had asked   he walked through our town  he faced his shame   and  for some   nothing would ever be the same again   i spied him first  you see  that's him   why have they taken him to the court house   well     a long time ago  er     when you were no more than a baby   your father got himself into some trouble and         they put him into prison   he hasn't been abroad as i told you   he hasn't been in spain   i'm sorry i didn't tell you the truth  freddy  i     i was trying to protect you   it was wrong of me to do that because i     i've made things worse now   freddy     your father has been held in a prison for all those years   but he escaped   he came here because he wanted to see you   he put himself into great danger   he must love you very much     he ain't my pa    freddy     he ain't my pa   give him a little while to find his own way   and how many payments has mrs arless made  mr hales   not a one  your honour   and i called on her no less than on seven occasions  sir   and on the few times i did manage to locate mrs arless   she made vague excuses about waiting for a postal order  and promised to make a payment 'next week'   he won't see you   i've only made things worse for the boy   i told myself i came back to show you how sorry i was   but the truth of it is  i only concerned myself with what i wanted   to see him     to see you   you're too hard on yourself  dan   a father's entitled to want to see his boy   what will you do now  alice   will you vanish again once they've taken me away   i shall have to see what this does to freddy   i just want to get his little head on the pillow tonight   that's as much as i can think about   if i promise never to look for you again   if i could give you that  if i could give you anything     if i promise with all my heart   and you could believe it     your father will be taken away tomorrow  freddy   i think he deserves a chance to ask for your forgiveness   i believe that's why he came all this way   i know it's a lot to ask of a boy   but could you give him that   mrs arless   why did you buy the beer if you knew you could not afford to pay for it   i was brought up to respect my betters  sir   and this gentle fellow here is a clever oxford man  with an expensive suit of clothes   now if a man with all his schooling in numbers and such  tells a simple gal like me  sir   that i can afford his beer   well  who am i to tell him he's wrong   having taken the beer  you made no attempt to pay the money that you owed   that's cos they made it so tasty  your lordship  sir   the deliciousness of it had me coming back for more   and the more i drank  the more i forgot my worries     beer does that for you  sir   i only wish they hadn't made it so enjoyable  and then i might've paid for it   did you not think it irresponsible  mrs arless   for a mother of so many children to spend your money on ale   that's why i didn't pay for it  sir   if my children see me worrying  that has them worrying   and no good mother would want that  would she  sir   so  see  if the beer makes me happy   that makes them happy  to see me happy   what would you rather my children had  sir   a downhearted mother  or a merry one   i would rather they had a mother at liberty to take care of them  and not locked up for bad debts   what is it  mrs arless   it's the distress of it all  sir  it's brought the baby on  your lordship  sir   i will not have you ridicule this court with your sorry dramatics  mrs arless   i no more believe your labour than i do your reasons for buying the beer   i'll wait for you upstairs   who started the fight   he started it  freddy   but it don't make it any better  what i did   i could tell you what happened   tell you it all   so that you know  if that's what you want   it was a public house quarrel that led to blows   he struck me  so i took my fist to him   i knocked him down   i wanted to hurt him   that's all i knew  that's all that mattered to me   i let my anger rule me  see   i waited for him to come back at me   but he didn't   he couldn't   he lay there  all blood and fear     and i watched that man die before me   that's my shame  freddy   i got to live with that   i don't expect you to forgive me or that you'll understand it   i'm just glad that you know it all   so you can decide whether you want me as your pa or not   sir  may i be allowed to speak   those of us who know mrs arless  sir   believe that it's her big heart that is her weakness   she cares for her children  sir   sees them fed before anything else   always has a fire halfway up the chimney to keep them warm   yes  but the debts before us today  mr timmins   are not for coal  they are for beer   well  sir  you see  mrs arless's husband is away at sea and     though she won't like to admit it  she misses him sorely   her neighbours tend to think this is the cause of her recklessness   she's no rogue  sir   she means well   her son has managed to raise a few pounds for her to pay today  and     if the court were to write to mr arless then     the brewery could get their money   it is not the business of the court to manage mrs arless's domestic affairs   my duty is to justice   as far as i can see  sir  mrs arless's greatest crime  was to be born poor and simple   mr timmins  i will decide what the crimes are before this court   and she was easily tricked  sir  by this salesman's slippery words   and i will decide what is appropriate evidence  you are dismissed   i will now retire to consider my judgment   it's all right  it's all right   i have made my judgment  based on the facts   i cannot allow myself to be manipulated by the emotions in this case   mrs arless  i find you to be feckless and foolish   you wilfully took on a debt you could not possibly afford   if you could not pay then i ask myself  did you truly intend to pay   but if mrs arless is wanton  then i find the brewery to be still more careless   indeed  more calculating than she is   it will not wash for you to claim the moral high ground here  sir   any company with a conscience would have a care  who it was they were pressing into debt  with their salesman's slippery words to buy beer   such a seductive crutch at a time of difficulty   the slightest investigation on your part would have revealed  that mrs arless was already badly in arrears   but that was of no concern to you   i look poorly on those who blithely take on debts   but i look severely on these modern sales techniques  that weave a spell on the poor  to buy goods they cannot afford   i have decided that it is my duty to teach the brewery a lesson   therefore i reject your bid to have mrs arless imprisoned   i have not yet concluded my judgment   mrs arless  you are fortunate  to have a son to raise a few pounds for you at the eleventh hour   and a neighbour to speak so eloquently on your behalf   you will pay nine pence a week until the debt is cleared   i strongly advise you take a care what debts you take on in future   you may consider yourself on parole   if i see you before me again  you will be punished    severely   court dismissed   thank you  pa  for speaking for mrs arless   i wish i could say that was the end of it   i spoke to your ma about you doing the postal round  laura   she has decided that i know best  i agree with her   you tell miss lane you're ready to start   for all her troubles and her failings  no one could dislike mrs arless   however much she might offend their taste   she was so overflowing with life and good nature   alf had given up something so dear to him  to raise a few shillings to rescue his mother   but my father was right   mrs arless's troubles were far from over   the hare is jugged whenever your appetite returns  miss lane   i don't know that i could live without zillah's jugged hare   bye  matthew   mrs macey and freddy left us soon afterwards     goodbye  safe journey    goodbye  miss lane   they went to live in dartmoor  to be closer to freddy's father     bye  thomas    good luck  now   people still called it 'mrs macey's delivery'  but it was mine now   taking me out into the world every day   so that i could come to know these people   and count most of them as my friends
