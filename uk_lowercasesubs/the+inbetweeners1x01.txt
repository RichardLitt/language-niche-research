 episode 1  first day  hi  i'm will   and here are some things i hoped wouldn't happen in my life   my father would leave my mother   i'm so sad   i'd be taken out of private education and forced to go to a normal school   well  this is nice     where the school nutter would then take a bit of a dislike to me   i'll rip your fucking throat out   but they do say    whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger   except polio   and it's not been all bad   i'm gonna take you outside and i want you to fuck me   really  this is the story of how i make new friends like him   friend  fucking friend   and him    and him   him not so much   and definitely her  just to confirm   we are going to have sex   but back to the present   to put you in the picture  i have no friends   it's my first day and i'm in the headmaster's office  for a welcome chat with the rest of the new kids   or  as the otherwise known as  the freaks    you could be friends with us   yep  everyone's going to think i'm one of them   and in a well meaning but disastrous move   as a new kid i've got to wear a massive green badge   i can discuss it with my head of sixth  mr gilbert   he seemed like an intelligent man   mr gilbert  you seem an intelligent man     oh  i seem intelligent     how lovely of you to say   no  i just meant     i've long since been insecure about my capacity for learning   so it's nice to have it ratified by you  a child   what i meant was  do you think these badges  that single us out as new kids  are a good idea   yes  if you have any more views on it   i suggest you join the school debating society   obviously  you'll have to start one first   oh  my mistake  he's a wanker     hello  john  i'm susie    and so began my first day   is this 6b   great  i'm will   cool   god  just had a meet with the head  and his pet ape  gilbert     what's his problem    what   that gilbert  what a tosser   i mean   ooh  i'm mr gilbert   i'm such a big  huge massive freak    and i just love to suck the headmaster's balls  and then      is he behind me     did you hear any of that    oh  yes   can we start again   as you can see from his rather natty badge   this is your new classmate  will   as you share most of the same classes cooper     you'll be looking after him    sir  that's not fair   lesson number one of the sixth form   life is not fair    sir  look at his blazer for starters   he's got an actual briefcase   his shoes are clumpy  his hair's a bit gay      and that badge    i mean the badge alone   it's happening  get used to it   one more thing   the first day of term drink down the black horse  this tradition is ridiculous and illegal   don't get excluded before you've even started     what's he talking about    oh  nothing   is everyone going for a drink

a favour and just hang back a bit  yeah   oh  sure   wanker   i still hadn't managed to shake the freaks   it's not like i was aiming high   i just wanted to be friends with someone who didn't have a badge on     might not go to this thing tonight    i'm pretty knackered   we've just had ten weeks off   he's just spent the last ten weeks wanking three times a day   that's why he's knackered   yeah  that's it  i've had 210 wanks and my cock's like a peperami     whose cock's like what    carli   it's just  um  nothing   are you coming to the pub tonight then  i'll be there   great    that's great     are you going  simon   not sure  i'm sort of more into clubs than pubs   gay clubs  he's just shitting himself that he won't get served     no  it's not that    come on  i'll buy you a drink   can you do me a favour though   sure  anything   you know what my mum's like   she'll freak if she hears i've been near a pub  so  don't mention it to your folks  yeah     sure    thanks  hon     do

friends with the boy now called  boner      are you coming to sociology  simon    boner  boner  boner     oh  i'll save you a seat    thanks   well  there you go  i suppose beggars can't be choosers   and so my quest to make friends went  not worse   but certainly not better   it was as if i had some kind of contagious disease  and to be seen with me was a form of social death   which it is  but i was amazed they worked it out so quickly   it wouldn't stop me  anyone can be your friend   you just need to hang around them long enough   don't look left  simon  there's a girl with a knee length skirt on     you might spunk in your pants    yeah  very good     hi  simon    all right  this is will     nice to meet you    ooh  briefcase     yeah  briefcase    yes  it's a briefcase   ooh

girls always get served  as soon as they get tits  they get served   and fit girls like her definitely always get served     i'm gonna get served    how do you know   i've got a fake id  innit  a driving licence that says i'm 18 years old   but you're not 18   that's right  neil  it's fake id     oh  no      is that your mum    i told her not to pick me up     she's fit    yeah  i'd fuck her     thanks very much   no  i would though  wouldn't you     well  if she's my mum    no    but if she wasn't     she is though      what he's saying is   if she wasn't your mum  would you fuck her

not invited   unless you bring your mum   did you have to pick me up   i just wanted to hear about your first day  i like your badge   why did you say i got bullied at my last school     i thought you were    no   i got wedgied a couple of times  but that was just a fad   they wanted a reason and that's what sprang to mind   instead of   i can't afford the school fees      i'm going to the pub tonight      with who     just some friends      friends  already   yes   friends already    make sure these so called friends aren't just making fun of you     why would they be doing that    i don't want you bullied again   i was not bullied   can i borrow 20 quid   for all the new sixth formers  this would be a massive night   it wasn't the drink  it was an opportunity to reinvent yourself   a chance for a new start   and i've told you money's tight   d'you want me to be called  pikey  by my mates  do ya     jay  i've got your dinner    don't come in  don't come in   all right  i won't come in   mum  can i borrow 20 quid   here's  10  just promise me you won't spend it on the fruit machines   i can't do that  i'm afraid  bye   it turned out we couldn't reinvent ourselves  without our parents noticing     that's a lot of gel in your hair    what   smells quite strongly  too   why are you telling this to me now   i'm just mentioning it  i can see you've got a lot in  that's all   i don't    i can't wash it now  can i  i've not got time   god  i don't know why you're like this sometimes     can i borrow 20 quid    and by  borrow    we meant  spend and never give back   next stop
