i want to talk to you about what is called racketeering   or the black market   it is being stopped   these food cheats are the enemies of the people   they've been cunning   but they haven't been cunning enough   they'll get no mercy from me   there must be no dirty fingers in the people's food    halte  englander   lawrence   hey  hey  hey   bye   achtung  englander   chalky   that is the worst german accent i've ever heard   come on  john  up you get   can't you snap out of it   so caring and so sensitive   well  i am  but you've been moping around for months now   i want the old annie back   well  maybe i want the old bea back   but that's not going to happen either  is it   sometimes i just wish i could wave a magic wand   if you had a magic wand  you could use it to hide that   i'll be fine as long as i wear a baggy jumper   bea  you're six months' pregnant  you can't hide it forever   i have to   if they find out  they'll send me home   you're right  you can't go back there   john's finished his evasion training   so any day now  he's off on his first proper mission   oh  that's exciting   nerve wracking   it's strange to think he'll be flying to all these glamorous places  but he won't get to see them   i've always wanted to see belgium   john said he'd take us after the war  a chance to be a couple again   annie  annie what about your breakfast   me and my big mouth   poor love   i don't know what i'd do if anything happened to john   anything for me   i always said  if one of us had to go  i hoped it'd be me   it's been steamed open  has yours   don't think so     joyce    no   before you say anything  it's not cos it'd be too boring   it's been translated   you can hand it over in tomorrow's post   when i've glued it down   here's one she's written to her father   i can't be doing this much longer   it stops when the war office says so   italian again   but we've been passing nancy's letters on for months now   when will they be satisfied   when they're sure she's not in league with the enemy   there are numbers   map co ordinates   don't panic  don't panic  it's me   john   john  what you doing here   no one said we were expecting royalty   you've forgotten mr  luckhurst is coming  haven't you   no  it's next week   it's today  any time now   who's mr  luckhurst   my worst nightmare in a stuffed shirt  that's who   food rations officer   tell me you've not got any more black market goods   there's a leg of ham in a milk churn in the barn   well  we can't do anything now  can we   might as well just lock me up and throw away the key   mr  luckhurst  what brings you back to my humble farm   i think the word you're looking for is derelict   well  a lick of paint  new roof  new walls could be  er     you know how tough it is to get materials  what with the war and everything   some people find it remarkably easy to get what they need  despite rationing   of course     if i catch them   then the penalties are very severe indeed   shall we start with the barn   why didn't you just tell me   what  and spoil the surprise   i didn't even know you had any leave   when you gotta go back   honestly  joycie  you've got more questions than the gestapo   would they stop questioning you if you kissed them   they might   hey  i'll ask esther  the warden  if you can stop up at the farm     i don't want any fuss    it's no fuss    esther  can my husband stay in the spare room     yes  he can      where's the fuss    no   what i mean is  i've got a better idea   can you get it   not without him spotting   what's that doing here   what   that   it's got a hole   we didn't want to use it by mistake   otherwise the milk just flows right out   i am aware of the properties of holes  mr  finch     shall we  er       open it   beg your pardon   you heard   you're right  the beds at the farm aren't comfy  i'll give you that   they're better than sleeping in a barn     the barn's more romantic though    no  you like home comforts   slippers  open fire  cup of tea   it means we can be alone   why don't you finish your deliveries  and i'll meet you at the farm   oh  i can't wait for you to meet everyone   how are we going to be alone if you tell everyone   all right  our secret then   mrs  fisher   i've been looking for you   i been on the egg run   i've had a report from the raf   apparently air craftsman john fisher has gone absent without leave   no  you must be mistaken  no mistake   has he made contact with you   no   i haven't seen him  no   if he does  you must report it immediately   do you understand   are you even listening to me   annie  i'm talking to you   nancy  leave me alone   sorry i spoke   just wanted to know if your letters had been tampered with   look  i don't get letters any more  in case you hadn't noticed   you having trouble     i can't bend like i used to    here   no bending needed   thank you   you're very kind   you're very welcome   so  where's your dad   racing here  there and everywhere   he's lost a leg of ham and he's worried he won't find it before luckhurst   shouldn't you help him look   that's what i'm doing   perhaps it's out here  somewhere   yeah  i've got it stashed up my jumper   i wondered what that were   better get your sack     john    joyce   something you want to tell me   what do you mean   i've just been speaking to somebody from the home guard   it's not like you think   how is it then   talk to me  john   why did you do it   why did you lie about having leave  you never lie to me   you know what'll happen if they catch you     how they deal with deserters    joyce  joyce   of course i do  that's why i'm going back   you're supposed to be on a mission   i know  look  i just     i needed   to spend time with you   you know you can't just go off when you feel like it   you don't understand   what if     what if my first mission     is also my last   how could i go without seeing you     you all right  nancy    not really   i telephoned my mother earlier   she told me she sent me a letter a week ago  but i haven't got it   you got one this morning   yeah  that was the one from over two weeks ago   maybe the cambridge sorting office has been hit   have you asked esther  she's in charge of post   do you know what i think   none of the letters actually go missing  they just get delayed   so that means someone has been reading them   oh  don't be daft   i'm going to go and find out what's going on   billy   can you get those jerries started   i need to talk to annie   what   this came to the manor house   lady hoxley asked me to give it to you   they found it outside tobruk   and harry's body   if there's anything     right  well  if that's all  thank you   right   this is crazy   you said it yourself  esther controls the post   just keep watch   so  you never broken the law  mr  luckhurst   let he who is without sin cast the first stone   mr  finch   no   i haven't   do you want to get something off your chest   this happens   forced to spend time with a food rations officer   the suspect becomes desperate to end the scrutiny   and what better way to end the pain  than to confess   they'd be stupid  though   a confession might be looked on favourably   i am going to catch you  mr  finch   mark my words   she's coming   bea   bea  whatever's the matter   it's annie  she just won't let me help her   yeah  poor love  she's  er  she's taken it really badly   but i never thought she cared that much about harry   who knows what people really think  eh   maybe annie told you that  but inside she really loved him   thanks for talking   right  well  i ought to get on   i was right  she has been intercepting my letters     why    well   do you remember when tucker asked billy  to keep tabs on me  i think he still thinks i'm a spy   so he's had esther steam opening my letters  to tell him what's inside   wouldn't you have spotted it before   maybe she got careless     i've got to confront her    no  you can't   you'd have to say you'd been through her things   well  i can't just do nothing   why  you've got nothing to hide   what you doing loafing     my liberty's at stake here    you still haven't found it then     you should be looking    mr  finch  mr  finch   not now  this is grown up business   luckhurst is getting closer     go on    but i might     i'm not looking any more for that blasted ham     i'm going for a drink    i might be able to help you   i've saved your bacon   where is it   it'll cost you   mr  luckhurst   just having a breath of fresh air   you'd take anything that doesn't need paying for   do you want to     come on then  join me   don't be shy  it'll only cost you a nettle brandy   drink   you'd better make it a double as there's only one of you   well  you've passed my inspection   although i have no idea how   your luck's run out   unless  of course  you've got suitable documentation for this   looks like a ham bone   well  have you   no   but then again why would i need it   because it's black market goods   ah  yeah  but it was in your motor   so surely  you're the one that needs the documentation     don't be absurd  it's not mine    it was there when you arrived   we thought it was a bit strange  didn't we   yeah  we did   if you're gonna keep a black market ham bone in your car  that's your business   but perhaps we should do the right thing and report you   next time  finch   next time   one of these days  you're going to find out what prison food's like   not today though  eh  not today  billy boy   did anyone see you   i took care   thanks   where have you been all afternoon   working   and worrying   i made a mistake coming  didn't i   no  you made a mistake going awol   who is it   no one   i thought part of you would be happy to see me   it is  i just can't play happy families  can i   not when the police could bang down the door any minute   they won't find me     you have to go back    what  now   i'll get the train tomorrow   i said it could be romantic sleeping in a barn  didn't i   what do you say we make the most of it   we should stop   ellen'll be waiting   and so will your chickens   we all have responsibilities   oh  come on  live dangerously  stay another ten minutes   sorry   you know  if you'd told me a year ago i'd enjoy feeding chickens  and this whole ruddy cheeked life  i'd have said you were barmy     so what changed your mind    what do you think     i don't want it to end    why should it   well  things could happen that are beyond our control   nothing is beyond our control  is it   nancy   you're right  it'll be fine   ellen will be waiting   so will the chickens   time for a refill   annie   annie   you've had enough   why   i mean it's not like i'm a married woman  is it   i used to be a married woman but then my husband went and died on me     annie  you're embarrassing yourself    and you can push off   here he is  eh  knight in shining armour   well  my sister might be impressed but i tell you  i'm not   come on  let's not do this in public   annie  come on     miss morrell    you gave me a start   did you feel the earth move   what are you talking about   last night  condover munitions dump got a direct hit   question is   how did the enemy know about it   well  don't ask me   what are you doing here   someone is passing co ordinates to the germans     suddenly it all fits    what fits   the pieces to the jigsaw   can't you do that outside   you'd ration happiness if you could   i'd ration your vocal cords   annie said nothing about last night   probably too embarrassed  or perhaps she can't remember   i thought she might be getting over harry   things seem to be getting worse   i'll leave you to it   nancy  come on   spoilsport   i thought you'd be at work by now   you mean you hoped i would be   so you didn't have to face me   billy told you then   what's going on   i've grown up a lot these last few months   who's to say i can't look after you too   no one's going to take away your big sister badge   you wouldn't understand  i don't understand     talk to me  annie    just leave it   besides  you've got enough to worry about in your condition   no need to ask if you slept well   what time did you go   i don't remember   what is it   it's just     usually every minute together is just lovely  but not like this   i am touched that you did this for me   how many couples get this chance   and if anything happens  then this is what i'll remember   you sneaking up on me in the lane  making love in the hay   stay with me today   i can't  i can't     i'll try and get away later    ok   joyce   i'm touched you did this for me too   another jerry for you   crouch down  i put potatoes in   ich verstehe nicht   you know how to use a machine gun so don't tell me this is beyond you   go easy   look at him  his war's over  his family hasn't been torn apart   he's just waiting to go home     he didn't kill harry    no   but he's the closest i've got   you can't do anything   i can't wait for them to make the first move  either   no   you looks like you've got the worries of the world on your shoulders   perhaps we're worried about the way we're being treated   oh  i'm sorry   did i forget to iron your clothes   chance would be a fine thing   it's just been a long day  isn't it   well  if you've something on your minds  you should tell me   don't cover anything up   so we should be open and honest  like you   nancy   forget it   you make yourself useful   go find joyce

what it is   they say it's always the quiet ones you've got to watch for     miss prim and proper  the scarlet woman   stop it  stop it  he's my husband  if you must know     what    he's just come to  see me before he get's posted  why are you hiding him then     legenda n o traduzida    he's deserted  hasn't he   joyce  what are you doing   you're a fine one to lecture me on morals   i'm not the one with an awol husband holed up in a barn   he's going back soon  we wanted to spend some time together   surely you can understand that   look  i never saw either of you   sorry   well  you didn't hurt him     that's something    i came close  though   it'll get easier   the grief   you don't think   i feel relieved that harry's dead   i'm sorry if that shocks you but     i feel relief that i don't have to feel a failure in our marriage any more   relief that i've got another chance   relief that he's gone   i see   no  you don't   and i really wish that you could say it's normal  but i know you can't  cos it's not   so i know i shouldn't feel like this   well   we all sometimes feel bad about things   every time i laugh  i feel guilty i'm enjoying myself while my husband's locked up in a pow camp   and what would you do if he died   i'd be devastated   that's the difference between us   i am sorry   i couldn't even tell bea   no  no  well  she's got problems of her own   hasn't she   i have two words for you   romantic picnic   i have two for you  yes  please   dennis   sir   miss morrell   get in the car   i've got some questions that need answering   what's this about

  i'm not pregnant   bea  she knows   you can't hide it any more   well  i'm not   follow me   you've no authority to ask me anything   i'm a patriot  that gives me authority   i'll answer questions to proper military personnel   not a deluded gamekeeper   sit down   or do you want me to stop you from leaving   now     miss nancy morrell   you know full well who i am   sergeant   but that's not your real name  is it   it's nancy morelli   an italian name   which explains you speaking i tie to the pows   it's not a crime   my father only changed it to protect us   to cover up the truth more like   i am not a sympathiser   i'm just a land girl doing my bit   strangely enough  i was about to give you the all clear   i've had your letters translated and examined   the war office  they seemed happy   but then     there was this   it's a letter to my father   it contains two coordinates of the condover munitions dump   paragraph eleven of the women's land army rules states   any girl found to be pregnant  must be demobbed immediately and sent home   with no opportunity to re enlist   it's a shame it has to end this way   it doesn't have to   you could keep quiet  not tell lady hoxley   then i wouldn't have to go   i don't have a choice  lovey  i don't     there must be something you can do    please   we need each other   and you like having me around  don't you   and i promise i will never to lie to you about anything ever again   no  it's too late for that  bea  it's too late   so this is it   yes     you can't send her home    annie   i've got to tell her  it's the only way   you've got to tell me what   our father's very strict   he's more than strict   that's why i married as soon as i could   we needed to get away from him   and you're sticking to this lie   it's not a lie  i've told you  they're dress measurements   because your mother's making you a dress   they'll prove it's a lie when the military police round up your parents   you can't do that   and you can't keep me here any longer   this badge says i can   look  i've told you all i know   please let me leave   miss morrelli  are you familiar with a code template   it's a piece of paper with holes in specific places   when placed over a seemingly innocent letter   it highlights a crucial phrase   read your letter now   condover    dump     and the co ordinates   the name and the co ordinates of a target hit by the germans   condover    there's a lace shop in condover   for this dress   dump    telling my mother not to dump any of the leftover fabric   look  this is crazy   yes  it is and it will stop any time you want   once you admit you're working for the germans it will come to an end   but    if the letter wasn't sent  then how could it have tipped them off   i'm not stupid  you're working with other collaborators   just because i'm italian   look this is exactly why we changed our name to start again   you're just like the rest of them   perhaps your mother will confess more readily   leave her out of it   will she survive the camp     please  i am loyal to the king    would she survive interrogation   i don't know why you're terrorising me     confess    why are you doing this   what's my mother ever done   well  we'll soon find out   leave us alone   look  you should be out there catching the real spies or the deserter   and what do you know about that   got everything   i don't think you'd fit in me bag   i don't know if i can go through with it  joyce   you're gonna be fine   a couple of days in the cooler  that's what you said   no  no  i mean go on a mission   dropping bombs  slaughtering families   i'd be just as evil as the men that destroyed coventry  wouldn't i     don't you dare    but i thought     i'd get in those bombers myself if i could  we've got to fight   otherwise  all the pain  all the loss it isn't worth anything  is it   come on  we've     we've all got to do our bit  haven't we   whether that's dropping bombs or planting spuds   what would i do without you   let's never find out  eh   air craftsman john fisher   i'm to escort you to hq and hand you over to the authorities     no  he was going back    move it   please  he was going back   what have you done   you couldn't keep your mouth shut  could you  i didn't do it on purpose     legenda n o traduzida    stop it  joyce  joyce   go for a walk and calm down   it's all right   i've ruined joyce's life and tucker thinks i'm a traitor   thank you for intervening  sir   i want you to stop persecuting this woman   with respect  sir  i believe she's working for the enemy   based on what evidence   coded letters  translated by the war office   and the war office are satisfied she's a spy  are they   yes   only i've just been speaking with major driscoll   when you took her in for questioning  he'd already told you there wasn't enough evidence   but that didn't seem to stop this one man vendetta  did it   you leave her alone or you'll have me to answer to   well   look   i've got no choice   she can either come and see lady hoxley with me or i can tell her myself   but the bottom line is she can't keep working in the land army   i can   but you don't have to tell lady hoxley   bea could stay here  we could hide her   that's ridiculous   i'll pay her keep   she can help out around the place  making meals  doing laundry  anything that needs doing   you're serious   i'll do whatever it takes to stop her from going home   you won't hear a peep out of me  honest   please   i'll think about it   surprised to see me   you owe me an apology   what's going on now   of course  you'll be handed over to the mps   they'll make my treatment of you seem like a cake walk   sergeant    email subtitling bbc co uk
