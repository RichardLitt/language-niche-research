i will be an old bailey barrister   but i would rather you embraced me  dear mentor   and am i blessed to have the both of you to serve me  sir     you are instructed    this goes very well     who is this    william garrow   court shall rise   two hangings before lunch  i recommend the broth   and i recommend you read your brief  again     guilty    no  no   i will pay for mr garrow   this young woman may be executed in consequence of your evidence  will you not dare to venture to recall   my husband would consider my participation in this an infidelity   not guilty   hurry up with that   the prosecutor is a gentleman       i've read the brief       of cavendish square   julius champion crespigny  pronounced crapeney   what i mean to say is  be careful   you are not invulnerable  william     and how will i defend william haywood    indeed  how will you   he shall not speak on his behalf  and i shall not call witnesses   he shall be innocent until proven otherwise   mr crespigny shall have to prove guilt   and with my assistance  he shall not   william haywood was indicted for stealing  on 21st august last   one pair of plated chariot harness  valued ten shillings   the property of william champion crespigny esquire     how do you plead    not guilty  sir   call william crespigny   i think he said he'd meet us in an hour   oh  maria   some assistance here   for god's sake  some assistance   mr haywood was my coachman a very few months   he quitted it the 12th of august   i paid him his wages and went to the country   after i had been in berkshire 3 or 4 weeks  i wrote to town for the old harness  and it did not come     why write for the old harness  mr crespigny     i required it   i see  and you have two coaches     i have one    ah  well    i am indeed sorry for that   mr garrow   sir  but one coach and you required  all of a sudden  two harnesses   am i at fault for requiring my property   was the old harness laid by as unserviceable   i knew it was useful but might want repair   then if not unserviceable  but unusable  but still you wrote for it     i am not at fault for that    did it have a sentimental attachment   it pained you to be separate from it   is that your only fault  you loved it too well       my lord     you will not mock me  sir    mr garrow   address yourself to the evidence and how to disprove it   when this coachman was engaged  did you make a bargain with him     i did  of course    good   and i will trouble you to state it   i believe  at first  he asked for 26 guineas     i do not recollect    this will be very important   and i'm afraid i must trouble you to tax your recollection   i believe  in the end  the standing wages agreed  were to be 22 guineas  together with other articles   yes   yes  yes     now we do make progress    i cannot say   do you recollect whether he was to have the old wheels and the old harnesses to make up the sum   i never allowed old wheels and old harnesses to any coachman   well  then  explain to me what those articles were that were to make up the 22 guineas to be 26 guineas   i believe     i believe i paid him 25 guinea   i do not have such a minute recollection   a few moments ago  you recollected it perfectly  now you'll guess away a man's liberty    i understood you   the agreement was 22 guineas a year wages   but what other agreements did you make besides   i believe there were    boots and breeches and    a number of     a number of etceteras that the coachmen generally have   etceteras   an old harness in want of repair  perhaps   under the pretence of my giving it to him  he took the plated harness out of my stable   upon this man being discharged  did he  by your desire   deliver you an inventory of the things in the stable     he did    good  do you have the inventory here     of course i have not    ah   and what if i was to tell you the old harness is not listed in it     impossible   and if i have here the inventory that proves it   my lord  this is improper   mr garrow   are you attempting to introduce new evidence   my lord  i'm merely introducing the face of mr crespigny to the jury at this moment   it is my fervent wish that they mark it   mr garrow  i will not have such tricks in my court   my lord  i apologise for the creation of such a misleading impression   but i cannot best mr crespigny  who stands before me  in the way of that vice   mr crespigny   i believe that at the time you parted  you were in considerable displeasure with this man   i was   and how it shows still   how it shows   no more questions  my lord   who would you call now  mr silvester   the shaking servant still in the gentleman's employment   i call     benjamin weaver  servant to mr crespigny         thank you  mr garrow  mr southouse    you're welcome   you attract some attention  mr garrow   you will introduce yourself  sir     thomas rawlings  from the london gazette    i see   he came for a murder  but all he has today is a diary item that a defence counsel was witty     come    witty  fierce and merciless     you think so    i think the coffee house is a better engagement than this   mr garrow  do you seek to change the nature of the trial   are the lawyers and not the judges to turn events now   the defence of the individual against the power of the state   the rights of defendants  against the rights of those who seek to prosecute them     come away  you are not a pamphlet    but he solicits my views   let your vanity be in the interests of your clients   not in the interests of yourself   you are envious   you are careless   are the judges to read in the london newspapers that you intend to take control of their courtroom   that can happen case by case   it does not require you to become famous   mr silvester  what do you think of mr garrow's speaking   i think it is like a racehorse     runs fast because it carries a feather   you are even lighter because you carry no convictions at all   mr garrow  can you expand more on the defence of the individual against the power of the state   have a care  sir   oh   agh  oh   help me   to attack unsuspecting women with such a weapon  is a crime rendered still more atrocious  by the savage delight he enjoys in the terror  pain  and distress of the lovely victim   elegant and attractive women  almost without exception   gentlemen   to raise a reward of  100      for the arrest of such a vile person  and a further 50 upon conviction   sir  sir   a journalist from my own newspaper   i can't think i pay him well enough    sir  i wondered  is there not the danger that     danger  sir     that this may lead to the apprehension of innocent men   innocent men may be inconvenienced   innocent women will be saved   thank you  sir  very good  sir  i will quote you directly   and at length     i'll see you in the chambers       lady sarah    mr garrow   you wish to pay me   your guinea fee for our defence of elizabeth jarvis   you should make payment to mr southouse  he will then make payment to myself     i see    he didn't explain this to you     yes  i do recollect now    it's of no matter     you did not    tremble as you made your way here    why would that be so   the monster  the sanguinary terror   ladies are now having copper petticoats fitted to protect them   yes  i thought you did enter in my chambers with a very decided gait   the only metal in my petticoats are in my stays  mr garrow     then you're not enthralled to this new fever    no  i have not that fever   yet i have to find my husband  i was not to go out unless in company   yet here you are and not in danger   i'll go to milk street and to mr southouse to make rightful payment there   sarah   you're not so mistaken about your errand here   judge buller  you can assure me that when this monster is caught he can be hung     so that you may proudly assure the public    that wouldn't just be politic  it would  be reasonable  would it not   it's a question of finding the right indictment that will see him hang   it's been difficult   but i find we are indebted to the sixth act of george i   the cutting of cloth   felony  introduced in 1721 to redress the issue of english weavers  slashing garments made of cloths from india   what has this to do with the monster   our monster does not murder   and common assault  even with intent to maim or kill  is a misdemeanour   but this  this cutting of cloth  is a felony     punishable by hanging   if a bad law will becalm london  we must have it   i hear there are calls for a permanent police patrol in light of the monster   that would be very expensive for the treasury   the home secretary will be most grateful to you   miss ann porter is down there  sir   he came upon me like a madman  and suddenly i found myself brought down into a most indelicate position   on your hands and knees   i had more regard for decorum than my wellbeing   i'm sorry to have to make you revisit your most foul ordeal  but it's merely my way of cataloguing the man's crimes  and so build up a body of evidence against him   and will news of my welfare appear in your newspapers   with all the other victims of this most aggrieved city   miss porter   i see   one further question  if i may   certainly   the wound  it heals now   thankfully so   and    anatomically     the thigh or   higher up   higher up  sir   higher up   you bear it most courageously   i asked you not venture out unaccompanied   i had no wish to have mrs browning as my companion   then you wish a monster to keep your company   then should i stay at home  employed at my needle and thread   arthur  i'm not strung high as a violin   screaming at gusts of wind  i have never been   that is why i didn't engage you at the old bailey   i made you a guest of judge buller to serve both of us   but your welfare to me is not your progress       it's your safety   maria  this is too much to bear     to be out in public again    no     what  then    that man  that man there     you know him    yes  i know him  i recognise him   that man is the monster  he is the monster that did attack me     stop    get him   it is nine o'clock in the morning     your son was arrested yesterday afternoon    yes  sir   i am therefore obviously not the first attorney whose assistance you have sought   no  no  sir   this morning  your son is the most unpopular man in london   no other attorney has wish to represent     the monster    he is not the monster   he has alibis for each occasion   he is not the monster because he is my son   a mother knows what her son may be capable of and while renwick may be many things  sir  he     what kind of things   i did read that 22 women were called to the magistrates in total   half of them claiming renwick bore a resemblance to their attacker but not able to swear to it   and the other half unable to do either  sir   so  pray  what would that tell you   that you neglect your mathematics  madam   there was one who did swear to it  a miss ann porter   but the numbers are good enough for me   let us hope it is good enough for counsel     i have heard of a mr garrow    oh  i am sure of that    monster at bay      god is merciful    hmm   not to those other poor wretches wrongly accused and brought up before the magistrate   they have him now  for certain  renwick williams  23   native of wales  no doubt  and an artificial flower maker   hardly an occupation for a monster but at least he be not an englishman     and this will be an end to your agitation    i agitate for london   well  the press reports from the magistrates' court have thankfully been extensive   and it appears there is only one indictment   which is  wilfully and maliciously cutting ann porter's cloak  gowns  stays  petticoat and shift      injuries to buttocks or thighs    disregarded   this indictment of cutting clothes is surely not a felony   you should know your law better than i   i can plead a case  do not expect more   they wouldn't dare to make the monster's crimes a mere misdemeanour   in london's current fever  that would cause an outrage     so in the cutting of clothes they have found a felony    how so   they've dug up an obscure and very perverse statute from 1721   i cut to the flesh  it's only pillory or prison   but if i merely cut cloth  i will hang   strange in fact     both  but true in law   you will take the brief   visit him in newgate   it is worth  surely  that   in london's eye  you are a beast  a creature beyond the pale   what i learned from mr southouse and what london must also know is that you are        respectable   a man who makes his way in society happily and modestly   my son was in the theatre  a violinist and teacher of dance also   i myself dance like the movements of heavy cavalry  but is very difficult to assure the opportunities it gave me   to guide the movements of the limbs of high born maidens   he has played violin in theatre orchestras   renwick  you will tell them of your musical gifts   i screeched a living with my bow  until the orchestra pits of london swooned with the smell of the drink i'd taken   i beg your pardon   what i mean to say is that i possessed a spirit  of such effervescent gaiety   the trammels of art were just too much of a confinement     mother  is that some improvement    are you the monster   good  a man as direct as myself     then you oblige me with a direct answer    mr garrow  i cannot lie   i am a man who does indeed go after women   i lay siege to them  in restaurants   dancing parlours  assembly rooms   and if i am lucky  they will allow me to lay into expenses for them   and if i am very lucky  they will allow me to lay     renwick  you must stop this now   he has settled in a permanent position now   he is a flower maker  he has put the habits of the past behind him   in defence of me  there is no one more vociferous or loyal   do you think you can summon up such a feat of conviction  mr garrow   if he is not the monster  he certainly enjoys his monstrosity   but surely you can still plead a case   i can already conjure up what the prosecution will say    he's a lecherous libertine   so you will not take this case because you think you may lose it   i will not take this case because i cannot well defend it   your rising reputation no match for the grime attached to his name   huh  how does a man bound for hell propel you   justice is not applause  approval is not the law   i cannot do what is not in my heart to do   you were called to the bar  they did not announce your heart there   your business done here  gentlemen   it seems the business of one gentleman here is certainly done   i have refused to defend the monster   from conscience   if you would listen to mr southouse you wouldn't venture that i am troubled by morals here     it is not a popular cause    you think me too much impressed with my popularity   it must be a true novelty to you   i find i do like approval   i have no parents alive who might do the approving   i am sorry for that   but you may be sorry if you do not fulfil your duty   sarah  win the case and i will not be thanked for it   lose it and i will be remembered as the monster's apologist   if mr williams does not have representation and is hung   that will not be  a trial but simply a lynching   gentlemen     mr silvester     if i take a fee from the monster  i may never get another     has mr garrow already refused it    mmm   finally he understands how discretion is the better part of valour   or is it that you will only defend those that will add to the sum of your goodness   there we have it  garrow  not the reforming revolutionary  but an insufferable hypocrite       mr angerstein    afternoon   forgive me   john julius angerstein   i see you take my publication     a man of judgement in all things  i hope    we have business  sir   the monster is your client   i would venture there isn't a respectable attorney in london  who would wish to receive a guinea to defend his crimes   therefore i am not a respectable attorney  sir   i am sure that is something i could persuade you to remedy   this comes from what  sir  that you fear i have lost my moral sense   or that representation may mean success   do you wish the man success   i wish him the chance to plead his case   and you have counsel engaged in this   of course   you take my newspaper  mr southouse   beware  it may take you   sir  his mother engages me  and i am very fond of his mother   i believe her   it's the monster's mother   that's the monster's mother     leave her alone   i hope he starves and rots   madam  i am sorry that you endure this   i would rather you defend my son than myself  sir   i will happily lose a basket but not so happily my son's life   your colleagues at the flower factory  they will attest to your attendance on the day of the attack   there is an hour they will not be able to account for          an hour     it is thirsty work there    i see  and the name of the inn you did frequent     several    and witnesses there who will attest to your character     have we dispensed with alibi    yes  i think we have   my character   to show that what you are accused of is inconsistent with who you are   i am sure there are some who would say that i am a man normal in my appetites   mother  your attendance here is a credit to you   but it's not really necessary   if there are ladies of your acquaintence who will appear in court for you  then you must inform mr garrow     mother      you must do so   they are prostitutes   they are the ladies of my acquaintance   and less apt to judgment on my station or my manners     very welcoming    i bring these men here to save you  renwick   please give them the incentive to do it  and please son  do not deprive me of the incentive to wish it   mother     it may be that you should not let me detain you   how can you speak to me so   half my life you have watched me disappoint you  and worn a brave face through it   perhaps you should not trouble yourself so painfully any more   but you did not do it  you are not the monster   alas  i am a very good fit   you have a mother  mr garrow   no   it is my good fortune  and her hell   you are not sentenced yet   then let us go to it   the ladies of your acquaintance  you mentioned that they were less apt to judgment on your station or your manners   less apt than who  mr williams   than that bitch   what person do you refer to   ann porter     you knew her already  did you not    oh  yes   why would she not let me seduce her   no alibi  character witnesses  from a bawdy house and a motive to harm ann porter   good god  we will never earn our guineas here   in none of these newspaper accounts  does ann porter anyway suggest that renwick williams was previously known to her     you look to the newspapers for        the preparation of your defence     we have no other intelligence  mr southland  angus dean's journals only further the case for the prosecution   you will find nothing to encourage you here   and your hands will be black with newsprint   good day   i find i like renwick williams a little more     it's not surprising    how so   he's wayward   outspoken   rude  belligerent  and an enemy unto himself   do you suggest      the likeness is remarkable   mr angerstein   a runner has just informed me that the monster struck again   another woman attacked and he was called to her assistance  and it appears it was in the very way the monster goes about his work   and    did this new victim make complaint     at the magistrates' court    nowhere else reported   i've enlisted the runner as a source of information for a guinea or two   you will not report this   on the eve of the trial  such a revelation   would create unnecessary alarm   and divert attention from the crimes of a man already identified   would you wish renwick williams  to go free because a woman yesterday made complaint which we print   there is the danger that another newspaper may find themselves  privy to this information and not feel quite so    delicate about it   and there is a danger that you will be in want of employment if you press the matter     the trial of this monster begins tomorrow   and   i thought to accompany you   there will be some uproar there   do you wish to stop up my ears from the oaths   stand fast as the mob invade the bench in their frenzy and overcome me   judge buller will be the man for that   he will throw his arms about you   that is a thought not to be born         what would be your purpose              i merely wish to observe the trial that is the talk of london   such frivolity from one so steeped in higher matters   together we could observe  and then     we could     engage about it   you wish to engage me   it is my only wish     mr garrow         mr williams    you're in want of more information   i merely thought you may wish some company   you did bring some  then     what's that       as you do not appear to be in possession of a small waist or dainty feet yourself     am i to be hung tomorrow   well  i must be honest with you  the whole of london has its hands on the rope   but if the law does its duty and i'm allowed to do mine  i think we may overcome the prosecution   and then you will save me from damnation   from death perhaps  but in life i think you are hopeless   your hands are black as the devil   yes  newsprint     oh  my god  who does rampage now through our streets  wielding his terrible weapon   oh  it's garrow's infallibility let loose upon us all   renwick williams was indicted for          unlawfully  wilfully  maliciously and erroneously make an assault on ann porter   you no longer find favour with the public gallery  mr garrow   take care   has humanity taken flight from this damn place   to whit  one silk gown valued 20 shillings   a pair of stays valued five shillings     you who slaver like dogs at the sight of a bone     silk petticoat  value five shillings   newgate is a haven of a civilisation in comparison to this dog's kennel     against this form of the statute and against the king's peace   mother   animal   animal   i did warn you  it's never a most congenial place   and renwick too infamous to expect fairness   i must return   from your poster  mr angerstein   the monster is generally described as  full eyes  large nose and is marked with the smallpox upon his cheekbones   now look  if you will  at the appearance of mr williams   and no sign of smallpox   men such as these are capable of fiendish cleverness   what  to gain six inches in height   you have invested a great part of  your energy and reputation in this case   well  i thought i was fortunate enough to be able to exert some influence on the outcome   you mean that your efforts would help to furnish arrest and conviction   i would think it be the hope of anyone in london to see such a conclusion   and is it not the case that what you would settle for  as the conclusion is the arrest and conviction of any man who might fit this sorry position   and in renwick williams  you think you had found him  and the matter over and done   in all this  i wished merely to save young women from the danger   i have here a collection of interviews  you conducted with the victims of the monster and were published in your own newspaper   the interviews were conducted under the general title   an authentic account         of the barbarities lately practised by the monster      and you do recognise them as your own    i do               good   why did you note the dress and appearance of the victims that you interviewed   well  i thought a description of each of the fair victims  to be interesting    may 12th  the victim is young  below the middle size with blue eyes that do allure    pale  soft skin  fine teeth  delicate and pretty   do you recognise her   mary forster   and another   june 6th    young  about or rather below the middle size  shiny black hair    striking black eyes  full lips  a dainty waist  an agreeable countenance and  again  very  very pretty    that's rebecca godfrey   what a noble opportunity presented to be able to sympathise with those beautiful women  yes   to sympathise  certainly  but also to obtain information   and provide a good excuse to visit them repeatedly     you will not imply      if only further to display your sympathy and want of information   it seems  sir  that you wish to save handsome young ladies from danger   if only to put them in the way of another     yourself    no further questions  my lord   thank you  sir   call surgeon tompkins   the case goes better  madam  decidedly so  come   the wound  surgeon tompkins  can you tell me of its appearance   er  four or five inches long   its middle part had penetrated the skin to a depth of an inch or so   a wound  in your view  only rendered by a sharp instrument   most certainly   and but for the bow of the stays  the wound might have penetrated the abdomen   if not for the bow of the stays  this may have been a murder   and the brave miss porter  that did suffer such trauma     is she fortunate still to be living    oh  yes   your witness  mr garrow   murder  you say  intent to kill   or at least maim   excellent   no further questions  my lord   it seems that mr garrow knows more of his law than we at first supposed   call ann porter   do you swear that you shall present the truth   the whole truth and nothing but the truth  so help you god   i do   miss porter   you can identify the man who maimed and abused you so cruelly   i can   and if it is not too much to bear   i wonder if you would venture to do so     miss porter  may i commend you for the grace and valour with which you have appeared here today   i am aware of the great attention which has fallen on me   but i merely wish to do my duty as a prosecutor  sir   even with the eyes of london upon me   especially with the eyes of london upon me   no more questions   i was not aware that you had asked any   miss porter   you will forgive me  miss porter  if any of my questions might confuse or dismay you   i can assure you that no man in this court may sympathise more with your sufferings than i   but firstly  i must insist  my lord the judge  that her veil be removed   i cannot bear to have the wretch stare upon me or look upon him   my lord  i ask the veil be removed so the jury may see  how my questions demand a truth that cannot simply come from speech but from the colours of a female cheek   miss porter   you will remove the veil   can you describe what your assailant was wearing on the day you were attacked     a tight fit coat    oh  it's a tight fit coat today  is it   can you explain why you told the magistrate that it was a greatcoat  a surtout     i was confused    may it have something to do with the fact that a runner   having searched mr williams' lodgings  found no greatcoat  as you had sworn it   but a tightcoat  and now conveniently you concur with that   he came upon me suddenly  i was       i was mesmerised by the knife before me    oh  the wretch   what words did your assailant speak to you on the night you were attacked     insults    such as   i cannot bear to recall such obscene and gross       bear it  madam         i will not    blast your eyes  you damned bitch     shame  sir    mr garrow   beg your pardon  my lord   i am merely quoting what comes from the magistrate's committal    blast your eyes  you damned bitch    i will take a particular pleasure in murdering you and drowning you in your own blood      you do recall recalling that    i have tried to put it out of my mind   how would you describe your state of mind in the minutes after your attack   it must have been the most terrifying experience   i was insensible with fear   but not so insensible that you could provide a thorough description of your attacker  and identify mr williams here   however agitated i might be  i should have always known him   his features are more impressed on my recollection than that of my most intimate friends   and because you were previously acquainted with him   not acquainted but accosted  sir   you will tell the court what passed between you   he had attempted to seduce you   it is too dreadful to recall   then you did at least rebuff his advances     i did disdain him most definitely    how so   i called him a shop man  a wretch and a scoundrel     and he did further insult you    he did          how so     no    no   will you answer the question  miss porter   precisely what the insult was    blast your eyes  you damned bitch    i will take a particular pleasure in murdering you   and drowning you in your own blood    it is very familiar   i put it to you  miss porter   that on that occasion  mr williams did insult you  most scandalously and indecently but there was never another one    am i to be insulted again    i put it to you that for those insults  you determined never to forgive him and to gain revenge   you seek revenge by portraying mr williams as the monster and the man who cut you   madam  your agitation seems to occur at the most convenient time   withdraw  sir   my lord  i ask you to bring my learned friend to order     very well    mr garrow   do not insult the witness     very well   miss porter  i accept that you were indeed attacked and cruelly used         but not by this prisoner   behold him  miss porter   a man it is easy to accuse  in that he is an unsympathetic figure   his position in society generally despised   his social habits far from respectable   but does he deserve this accusation and the death it may bring him     does he deserve the way you have set your eyes upon him     he should not have set them upon me   that is your answer   now we do most certainly have your answer   you do hide your own iniquity   no more questions  my lord   the court will adjourn   the court shall rise   my chambers   scheming  swooning  irrational  she acts like a defective man     and garrow a heartless one    well  she deserves no one's pity or admiration   who's the real hater of women  the monster or his counsel   judge buller awaits me   this prosecution fails     mr garrow has      the court is yours  it's not garrow's   my duty is to give advice as to the law  as to proof   williams's conviction may answer your difficulties in parliament  but this jury may not even convict   well then  it is your duty to direct the jury to see it favourably   mr garrow   lady sarah     you're alone     sir arthur did need the ear of judge buller     in this case     i fear he does not attend him for entertainment   ah  i think the jury may yet acquit   if the judge does turn their attention to the law and away from the hue and cry   the judge will not   i think we may be in want of one very particular law  mr southouse   indeed   gentlemen   the attack on miss porter is not in dispute   her identification of her attacker  absolute   and the motive of the prisoner  apparent   as for his alibi  that's barely credible and certainly not convincing   this is a man who had previously waylaid miss porter with lewd intent  and when these intentions were frustrated  threatened her most violently   you have before you an opportunity to remove this foul potential  from the streets of london and restore peace of mind to its gentlewomen   i trust you will do your duty by them   you will consider your verdict   you have reached a verdict   we have   how do you find the prisoner  guilty or not guilty     guilty    damn the lot of you   this is a lynching  not a trial   renwick williams  you've been found guilty of the indictment     the sentence i pronounce upon you      my lord            is that you be     my lord  i submit my client has been wrongly indicted and that any sentence be respited     you're a little late in the day  mr garrow    my lord  if you will allow me   mr silvester   my lord  very well  i will hear you   in 1721  certain weavers who were objecting to the importation of indian fashions  purchased in preference to theirs own goods actually poured aqua fortis onto the clothes of people wearing those fashions   to stop these outrages  it was made a felony punishable by hanging  to assault any persons in the public streets with intent to tear  spoil  burn  deface or cut the garments of such persons   my lord  the clothes of my client were cut   but  my lord  you did accept the evidence of ann porter  who quotes my client as wishing to murder her   you did hear and accept the testimony of the wounds to her flesh   this surely would prove by my client an intent to maim or kill  which is a misdemeanour        a misdemeanour    strange in fact  but true in law  therefore  therefore     mr williams should face a retrial for the minor offence  for the misdemeanour of wilfully and maliciously cutting ann porter with intent to maim and kill her   it was  of course  impossible for him to strike miss porter's person  without    cutting the clothes   unless he did in fact     cut the clothes in order to get to the flesh underneath   it's an ancient statute   indictment is indeed debatable   i shall reserve the case for the 12 judges of england   sentence is respited until then     what does this mean       you'll at least not hang   why did you come here     i was sent here    by whom   you wish only to engage me   in what  sir  certainly not the truth   the home secretary sent me   in all this  i wanted nothing more than the safety of this city     it was a weak law to try a man's life with    all law is weak if men can bend it to their will   i did not succeed there  mr garrow was very persuasive   mr garrow saved an innocent man's life   lady sarah   neither the old bailey or i can detain you further   i'm already detained by you  sir   it's injustice that quickens your heart   dear will   you are mistaken in that   mr rawlings     a foul attack   monster still infects the streets     tomorrow's edition   but this is the times  not the gazette   angerstein would not allow it   the times are very happy to employ me with it   three more attacks  identical  all committed during williams' incarceration     you come with this now    this would have served justice during the trial  mr rawlings  not after it   my position is only now just secured   so you are safely in your new employment while williams still rots in newgate   i'm afraid there is more  the runners have a man for the crimes   i would happily lay my hands on you  rawlings     but i will instead shake  the hand of my client    come  william      which should prove to be a most welcome occasion   and i shall be even happier to tell his mother   indeed  mr southouse   gentlemen  it appears the rough court of newgate  has given its own verdict here   madam  my profound sorrow   and your son now proven an innocent man   an innocent man should be a free one   and living   i would offer her consolation in prayer   but god will not change the law     you think him not guilty    i defended her as best i could   mr forrester  still filling your pockets with blood money     many in the house hope you will lose    you overestimate mr garrow's influence     how much would a criminal pay    i wouldn't know   you are ill prepared   be reckless with your own life  not your client's   beast  vulture   e mail subtitling bbc co uk
