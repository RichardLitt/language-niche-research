breakfast   it is our work  captain   it is yours  reid  me  i have other matters to attend to   hanging off a tart's tit   don't knock it till you've tried it  sergeant   reid  i'm serious  i'm not     reid  what is this   a 63 year old man   series of wounds and fractures to the skull and jaw   no  i mean this   this is your new dead room   now  look here   curved indentations to the cheek and to the forehead   belt buckle   belt buckl      you see  now this is why i send for you   what do you mean  mine    these are to the specification you described  is it not   now would you look here  jaw flattened and the skull stoved in   hot water  too   your description was very precise   it may well have been  reid  but i was talking about  the john hopkins in baltimore  not a cop shop in east london   should we not aspire so high  you and i   the mortis is set in  you'll have to wait to get in there   this  though     drake  a measuring tape  ah  drawer  top   he has a name  this man  it's manby   and he has served the good children of this borough  a sight longer than you have whored through it   thank you  nurse   it's a small boot  how small   small  mr reid  sir  the vigilance committee marches on us   reid  now  this room  i'm flattered   but i have made no call to be deputised   you would sooner return to your     in growing toenails and hawking snake oil   toenails and snake oil mean bread and whisky   and how exactly do you intend to compensate for monies  left unearned  whilst i lead you from ignorance here   reid   what's this  george lusk  finally decided on applying for uniform   if matters weren't so grave  i'd be inclined to enjoy your comedy   no  inspector   the men of whitechapel do your job for you once more   thomas gower  the lad what robbed and killed our toy seller   the emergency patrols were disbanded three month ago   you vigilantes were stood down   on whose say   it's not for you to tell us  when we may organise  in defence of our community   better still  you thank us     and consider yourself fortunate we bring a culprit across to ya   i consider myself nothing of the kind when it comes to your presence  in this world  lusk   now  this boy has done what you say  he will feel my outrage   but i will not simply take your word for it  not you  lusk   your own offences are as bad as the felons you hunt   i don't ask you to   these were found on the boy   it's got its maker's mark on it   and i have five witnesses saw him  leave the alleyway not two minutes before old manby was come upon   names  sworn statements   that boy is to feel punishment   he does not and we will string up every street arab in the quarter  from the gaslights of the high road   get up   look at me  boy   there's an army out there ready to roast you on their spit   look at him   you see how a story emerges here that fits you for this crime   i would be wary of this silence   it may oblige me to send you to trial   quiet in court   the jury return with their verdict   boy's lawyer  churches with my wife   all rise   how do you find the boy   guilty  your honour   that'll teach ya   my thanks to our jury for the speedy delivery  of sound verdict   however  given the boy's barely comprehensible  and continued silence   does counsel wish to speak for him  before i pass sentence on his guilt   my lord  i do   this is a child stood here   i would hope that you might recognise that as an opportunity  to assert the sanctity of that childhood and to be merciful   this boy and the others like him  who we would blame for the violence on our streets   it is not they who we should punish   but the fagins who stand behind them  directing that violence   these innocents  we should protect   you would urge an attempt at reformation   i would   reformation be damned  mr eagles   this child  we shall make an example of him   no  my lord  please   he is 14 years old and admits nothing of this crime   yeah   thomas gower   three days hence  you will be taken to the gallows at newgate   where mr berry will deliver you  from this life and into the next   mrs manby   inspector  i would thank you for your diligence and speed   you and mr lusk  here   you serve my husband and his memory well   inspector   the boy is of tender years  the sentence     immoderate or apt   my duty was to fetch the lad here   all else is for greater men than i to settle   shame  shame on you  you fetch a child to his murder   wash your hands of him and call your duty served   shame on you  shame  get out of here  miss   justice may not make friends  reid   i will not be silent  i will not   is the jewess on your ticket  is she   i know her not  though she is of my mind   then shall i ask my sergeant to return her   so i may remind you both of the facts here   that this condemned boy was brought to you beaten blue by his captor   no  mr eagles  that the victim's belongings were about him   that five men saw him depart the scene at some  speed soon after    though none saw the act     that this boy is no stranger to violence   and that finally  when presented with the opportunity   he even now refuses to deny it   lusk and his hamheads have served an entire hymnal of guilt  and the world has sung from it   mr reid  you are no stranger to the horrors of our city   but have they poisoned your heart  so completely that you truly believe this boy   this boy alone     capable of the savagery brought down on that man   it's finding this boy's master that will bring true peace  to our streets  inspector   i will do what i can still  but thomas gower will hang   would you look me in the eye and say you rest easy with that   get out of here  get out of here   these young that riot here  lusk will use their violence  to justify his place on our streets   and respect for badge and uniform suffer further  sir   oi   oi   not so fast now  are ya  eh   wait  this name on your knuckles  what does that stand for   do you know thomas gower   tom gower  of course i do and he'll never squeal on us  neither   aargh   vicious little runt   what do you make of those markings  what is that   a brotherhood  a gang   been gangs on these streets as long as there's been horse muck on them   they're not near as young and savage as these   then their hands must be guided by another   i would not tell him so  but there is something in mr eagles'  position i might lean toward   we are to choke this boy now  but before we do   i would have a broader picture painted as to what and why   find captain jackson  bring him back to the dead room  tell him     tell him i would have a more intimate study of our fellow  manby   good evening to you   god sends his confections for the poor boys what's incarcerated here   this way  sir   now  you tell me should any other come visit my boy   i will  sir   all right  tom   you must be strong in your silence  lad   rose  what     sergeant drake bid me wake you   i've been looking for you all night   i should have thought to search the gutters  where you been   i don't know   get up   we cannot open it   thoughts   cigarettes  vanity case   murdered for that and tuppence ha'penny  no   we're getting inside there any time soon   we must be thorough  i suppose   drink this   what's in that  reid   various  magnesia for the heartburn   rum  sugar syrup  cocaine   well  thank you   i'd have you happy in your workplace   you have a bite block  reid  i do  i do   ratcheted   well  look at you   huh   what  what is it   take a look for yourself   his tongue is cut out   there's more in there than that  reid   dental restorations   gold dental restorations   we're told the boy's motive was theft  are we not   he cuts the man's tongue out  yet disdains a year's worth  of picked pockets sat right in his face   this was no smash and grab   there is a wider purpose here   make good what you have done   whatever you say  reid   this matter of being dead   tell me it ain't all bad   always been a manby on this street   my day  it was her old man   he didn't want the shop front changed   she kept her name  husband took hers   took both daughter and business for his own   what do you recall of the father   only that he'd see me and my kind off  if we loitered too near   a version of gower's luck was yours  too   well  his ill manner and ignorance  certainly   drew the line at murder  however   perhaps the recruiting sergeants were the saving of you  bennett   perhaps they were  sir   early in the day to be disturbing so recent a widow  inspector   early in the day to have stopped with her  lusk   should those sewer rats seek reprisal   the widow knows she cannot rely on you for protection   she can look to us for questions  however  and provide answers   your part in this matter is played  yet still you investigate   what questions would those be  mr reid   excuse us  ma'am   as to what connected your husband with this child   her loved husband's murder connected them  reid   and that boy is under key and condemned for it   mrs manby  do you know what these are   they are patent applications   such matters are costly   they are four pounds for every filing and there are many   i'm not sure your profits  given the volume   would have stretched sufficiently   where do you suppose he found the wherewithal   he wouldn't take from my daddy's till  not never   then  do you see   i must ask myself from whom he took the loan of it   if he'd only speak  that boy could tell us  i'm sure   have you lost the last of your scotched brains   no   i forensicate myself   may a woman ask why   if she swears to serenity   you wait all morning to tell me that   why would you do that   because i knew how you'd react   i told you when we sailed  i begged it of you   put it in the ocean   how  now  would you prefer me to react   maybe as if the world has not  in fact  just ended   an interested party gets their hands on that ring   the end of the world's exactly what we are looking at  you and i   our life here  finished   all right  boys  let's see how we're doing  jack   edmund  you are alive   you are here so often these days  i have forgot how you look   then you come to remind yourself  do you   wanted a word with mr eagles   two minutes  mr reid   i should    emily   these  er  places  will ever make me think of you   the bells clanging  the faithful falling to their knees   and you and i at home   careless of god  abed in our sweat   i would have those sundays back   well  we live in different times now   once i had no need of church   but now   coming here  speaking with mr eagles   i see that i do   so do you  edmund  if you'd only accept that she is dead   what  emily  what have you spoken to him of   mr reid  should i find you a ladle   no   no  eagles  not today   i've a theory i would put to you     how your boy might recover his voice   i believe that tongue was taken as proof of the death itself   it was manby himself who was the aim of the assault   not what was on his person   we have enjoyed welcoming mrs reid at worship  and hope that the comfort she has found there  might be extended to yourself   stay away from my wife  eagles  i simply     take as fact that god's law holds no fear for me   oh  my god   they say it is a painless process   now  the executioner  mr berry  is a very clever man   it takes a person's weight to establish  what length of rope they require   too long  they fall too far too fast  and the head comes clean off   too short and the neck is strangled  instead of dislocated   i say more than they     there's not much of you  is there   wouldn't have thought you'd need much more than    ten foot   now  if it was you that ended that old man's life  i cannot say   but this brotherhood you run with     you make a practice of cutting  men's tongues from their throats  do you   what  boy   it wasn't what he had on him  was it   manby himself was the target   you must tell us who made him so   two days  thomas   i will stay beside you every hour until   but this end awaits you     unless you talk to us   i have you   what ring is it that you've lost   was it the one you wear about your neck   i weren't eavesdropping  promise  the whole house heard her   is it very valuable to you   it belonged to a man that i knew   a good friend  a  er     brother   dead now   mr eagles   thomas   shh  it ain't safe here   what do you mean   please  it ain't   if you want me to tell you what i know   you get that bluebottle and fetch me out of here   you understand   i go to send word  mr eagles  will i go to hell for this   your bravery will save you and all others who serve this man   i will be back  and soon   ready them   mr reid  sir   from mr eagles  sir   have a maria readied and despatched for newgate   hobbs  you travel with them  you tell no one  you keep him hid   whoa   the way's    the way's barricaded   you  man  stop   wait there  thomas   no  thomas  you're to wait inside   thomas gower   the love we bear you  does that not mean nothing to you   squeal  would ya   me and your brothers   you know we cannot let you live now  tom   hey   you shall not take him   you shall not   who is this man that stops me   my name is patrick eagles   you pass through me first   you  run   mr eagles  no   run  thomas  run   i'd know your name  sir   before i crack your skull   now  thomas  go   go on   i said i'd know your name   or do you give it only to the farm animals you lie with   inspector  inspector   inspector reid   the streets sing with rumours of your folly   can it be true you've lost him   remember  reid  boys from gaslights   are you here on this earth to bring me to murder   you keep the peace   see how he loses command of the streets and now of himself   get your hands off me   these children run riot over him   the lawyer   signs signature   belt buckle   signs less so   it's a ring   sir   look at me  constable   it is a fool who joins a fight he cannot win   i would far rather have you here  alive talking to me  than otherwise   have you seen this man before   some kind of scouser  i think   scouse    and he had these tattoos  sir  all about his hands   you know  picture cards  like the youth has and a hundred more   who is this that brings his way of life to my streets  a usurer   who kills for monies left unpaid  then gulls and fits  young boys for his own violence   and now hunts one such  before he'd tell us what he knows   then we must hunt thomas gower also  but faster and smarter   hobbs  you go to records   we need to find somewhere that he might consider safe  as home   you search every record and birth certificate of every family  that might match his name  yes  sir   sergeant  get yourself to newgate   my guess is that ship's sprung a leak   and i think i know where   he's your brother   his world   it starts and ends in the same place as yours does   and yet you still can't find him   now     you get back out there   and you return only should you have something of value to report   gower  thomas  years 1872 to '78   you  there  i want a word with you   who is he  who'd you tell   just a man  like you   come to me with threats and violence   name  he never gave it   honest  see me for the coward i am   i'd tell you if i knew   i don't know why you all care so much about one boy   one little christ killer   what d'you call him   saw his little prick when we scrubbed him  he's cut   it's a jewboy you fight for   well  nothing  sir   keep looking   throw out the gentiles   jewish   mr reid  sir   i have him   the orphanage off castlemaine   i have not seen him  since the day you delivered him to the hangman   i don't know why you believe he would return   because he owes his name to you   an english name   it was an english world in which he hoped to survive   he had none he was born with   he might have   the cruelty men found him  trapping rats for food in a railway yard   he was eight and knew no parent to tell him it   and you became that parent     that person to whom he may now turn   miss goren  you will get word to me  should he come to you for refuge  will you not   i will  inspector   then i thank you   she lies  or she is soon to   we wait   no girls  are you sure   if there was  i would have enjoyed one  i checked   i did not   listen to me   that ring was on his fist  when he beat a man to death with it only last night   he's an evil one   you be wary   you forget who we are  what we have done   get out  get out  don't come back here  till you have him   who is this that intrudes here   woman  how do you know where to find me   i know many things   how to make a man rich  for example   you would serve me well   serve you  indeed   you make me equity partner in this here enterprise of yours   you will feel our benefit   you're touched or you're drunk     or you're both   no  sir  i'm neither   imagine     i bring my girls into your service   their  erm  encouragements   inflame men to greater exploits at your tables   any losses you suffer will be recouped by way of the pointed  lust your briefly enriched patrons exert upon the girls  who've aroused them so   you are indeed     a woman   and you're indeed a man   will you show me your tables   place a bet   perhaps we may rehearse our intentions a little   the woman  stop her  stop her   no  stop   steal from me  would you   let me think of what i shall take from you in return   this pretty nose  perhaps   drop that  drop her   that ring is ours and she's mine   this i give to you   that's not enough  not near   well  i guess we're at a pass  you and me   we are   wait  wait  wait  wait   i have more to trade  i have  erm  information   valuable information about     thomas gower   see  sergeant  she goes to him   thomas  this will always be your home  but we must find an answer     the answer may have found you   you will not take him     i can keep him safe  miss goren  the street cannot   how is he called  this scouse you hide from  please    carmichael   don't be rough with him  he's only a boy   and you collect his debt for him   debt  my arse  then what  thomas  what work does he set you to   it's him   upstairs   keep him hid   come now  come   inspector   a parlay  sir   you have nowhere to go   what is your aim here   to have my boy returned where he belong  and then we can all go home  safe and warm   if i choose to deny you this   do you have children  inspector   but if you do not  i pity you   the love they bear you  you see this youth here   no idea what that youth will do for me  do ya   own a grown man's savagery  for example   i tell him to tear this place apart and everybody     young and old   inside and they'll do it and they'll thank me   now  what manner of atrocity do you wish to be served here   will you give him up or no   i will not   his word will send you to the rope   he is my prisoner and in my protection   then  at the time of my choosing  inspector     we will end you all this night   there will be nothing left to indicate who or what  took place here   it will be my passover   and it will be on your head   these walls and doors are sturdy enough  we are secure   they are still not many  cannot stay outside for ever  all will be well   did you hear what the inspector said  all will be well   perhaps if we ask him nicely  he may put you to your beds   what do you think   which one is yours   head up  lad   no good ever came from moping   this one  mr lusk   thomas gower   you  to what end do you bother me   i bring you news   which  if acted on  will bring you all you seek   these children  do you know where they have come from   not all  no   if a girl  say  was brought to you and had perhaps lost  the memory of her home and her name  would you take her in   i would  yes   and i would hope that  in time   her name  her memory  would return to her   men say some are born evil  others blameless   the truth  in my experience  is simpler  they are mirrors     as evil  or as innocent as the world that gives life to them   and this world    i need not to tell you this  sir   this world is a wicked one   then why  why do you take on this burden of care   i am a secular woman  inspector   i have seen too much of the truth of things to be otherwise   but this of my faith i hold onto      save but one life and you save the world entire    what does this stand for  anyway   i got some of me own  you know   came by it in egypt   in the army   holy man painted it   made offerings and prayers for me   in his tent  in the desert   said it would let me sleep   what d'you need 'em for   things i kept seeing   things i didn't want to see   fair dos  then  your go   pictures mean different things   king's a mugging   knave's a house break   no queens   queen's a rape   and manby  which is he   we ain't supposed to take none their belongings   save for their tongues   save that   he was ruining her  his inventions and his patent applications   had his hands in her daddy's till  after all   it wasn't a debt you were collecting  was it   carmichael is paid to have men killed    correct   and he instructs you in the killing of them   their tongue cut clean to prove it   the wife paid  all i knew  she wanted him gone   out of your beds  out of your beds  get in the corner   down  down   sergeant  oi   at them   get at them   inspector   how about it   me and you   woman  you are dead   oi  liverpool   stand aside for the vigilance men   thomas gower    where are you  boy   it's time you came home  lad   grab 'em  quick   i'll take that boy  now     as recompense for my actions here   and i will tell you what i told this man     that he is my prisoner and in my protection   you think yourself above the law  you'd best start acting as such   come on  out   now  whatever has passed here  whatever we say of you   that you were carmichael's creature in all of this   we cannot be certain the courts will agree   you get him away  far away   go with him  thomas   thank you  sir  he'll make a great little soldier   his name's sergeant randall and you do as he says   now  i've told him you are 18   the ship leaves gravesend in the morning   you're saving me   no  i do no such thing   where you go to  all you've yet known will seem no more  than a sunday fair   here   in you get  lad   look sharp   carmichael's ring   so i see   and what perplexes me     is that two years previous  there was a wire  from your pinkerton brothers in chicago   the name sent to the constabularies of the known world      search for a man  alive or dead    and if you look here     engraved in the inner is the very same name     matthew judge   tell me   did you chance upon that name during your time with the pinkertons   no   no  reid  i can't really say that i have   i thought it worth asking  always worth that   a sergeant's rate  computed daily   what i shall pay you for your services  does it wash   do not dicker with me  captain  you are of great service to me   you have saved souls this past night   but    do not think my curiosity  as to how you knew i needed such   is easily put to bed   well  then  it washes   did you return that wire   from the pinks  oh  i did  i did   told them the ring was recovered from a murderous kidsman   and that if their matthew judge was anything  he was dead   you  i will haunt you and drag you to hell with me   go home  sergeant   thank you  sir   you pray for mr eagles   it is a waste    a terrible waste   it is not   a child breathes that would not have   had mr eagles lived  many more would have come to thank him    whoever saves one life  saves the world entire    it is from the talmud  i believe   emily  i know what you told mr eagles  you had no business doing so   what am i to do  edmund   i mourn her   and because you will not  i must do so alone   mr eagles was kind to me   he allowed me to speak of her   to imagine her in heaven   to imagine a life    beyond this pain   would you deny me that  i would take your pain   i would amplify it a hundredfold and bear it  for you every day of what remains of my life   but    i cannot do what you ask   you listen to me  you stay with me   you stay alive  stay alive   you live   you stay with me   please   i will do anything   brought to you by
