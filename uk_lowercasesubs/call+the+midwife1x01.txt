a nun   we are the sisters of st raymond nonnatus   midwives and district nurses  present at life's commencement  and at its end   i assume you are possessed of the appropriate credentials   i'm a trained nurse  and i've just qualified as a midwife   the blooms upon this table are my especial care   dear st raymond nonnatus   happy survivor of caesarean section   i feel we are prompted to go in

julienne  there is no cake   sister evangelina  may i introduce nurse lee   there is nothing in this pot but crumbs   but mrs b made one this morning   i saw her when i came in from my delivery in mitre street   i know she did  it was coconut  which is a very insinuating ingredient   liable to smear itself all over the consumer's face   are you talking to me  you must calm yourself  my dear   you are turning quite scarlet   our newcomer was hungry   nurse franklin  go into the kitchen   you might seek out something else to eat   i seem to recall a packet of gypsy creams   let's hope mrs b has put a lock on the tin   i bet the newcomer had one slice and you ate all the rest   if i were a dog  she would not be satisfied  until i had slunk beneath the table with my tail between my legs   how you all foam and fret   i shall retire to my chamber and see you all at compline   come in   sister monica joan was one of the first midwives  to qualify in england   her family did not approve of her career choice   nor did they support her entry into religious life   it is our privilege to care for her   i see     it's just     i ate at least four slices of that cake   and i didn't realise i was coming to a convent   dear  did you get a dreadful fright   i thought it was a small private hospital   well  i do hope you won't run away   do you have a faith  nurse lee   not really  i'm church

i'm afraid i don't speak spanish  mrs warren   she's saying  welcome to our home    it's all right  she knows the drill   how many previous pregnancies have you had  mrs warren   cuantos  veintidos embarazos  pero veinticuatro ninos   twenty two pregnancies  but she had two sets of twins   there's twenty four of us altogether   twenty four  but you've hardly got any stretch marks   i don't know the word for that so i can't translate it   i'll need to ask your mother some questions   so we can establish dates   when did you last have a period  mrs warren   i can't ask her that  she's my mum   how are you darling  all right  dad  is that you   the nurse is here and she's asking really embarrassing questions   well  come down here and see to denise   she needs her drawers changing  don't you  my little dove   you behave yourself   let's sort you out  shall we  i reckon she's new   mi len   you're even lovelier than when you first got up this morning   i'm afraid i need to ask your wife some questions  of a personal nature  mr warren   do you need to know about her periods   well    yes  i do   well  she ain't had none of them in years   she's had all the babies one after the other   when do you reckon it's due  then   twelve or thirteen weeks  i think   well  don't let us hold you up  nurse   that's all we need to know   this is a booking in visit   i'm supposed to advise the expectant mother on diet  and hygiene in the home   i've got some leaflets   don't you worry about us  nurse   we've had twenty four babies  haven't we   we ain't never lost one yet   i didn't know where to turn  or how to take my leave     they seemed completely unconcerned   about the pregnancy  or the mess   the pregnancy and the mess  they only had eyes for each other   exactly  and look where it's got them   and how can anyone have twenty four children and still look so young   now you've opened a lovely jar of worms   because she was fourteen when she had her first   she may even have been younger   mr warren brought her back from the spanish civil war   most men would be happy with some enemy binoculars   she was his beaker full of the warm south    with beaded bubbles winking at the brim    i know not why you seek to scorn me  i am merely quoting keats   i delivered conchita's last little girl  and do you know   mr warren never left her side   what  a father stayed in the room   if i was a policeman i would ask questions   a policeman did ask questions   she was of interest to us when she disembarked at tilbury   but the rector wanted them married   so every legal obstacle was simply waved away   see  i am not deemed capable of coherent recollection   but some things are etched upon my membrane   they are preserved like    like watermarks on vellum   come on  stir your stumps   i'm first call and you're coming with me   there are between eighty  and one hundred babies born each month in poplar   soon as one vacates its pram  another one takes its place   and thus it was and ever shall be   until such time as they invent a magic potion to put a stop to it   sister evangelina   afternoon   midwives   she's upstairs in bed   the pains are every ten minutes  and i've got the hot water on   cup of tea  sister evangelina   we shall have one apiece   and put some extra condensed milk in nurse lee's   she's very junior and needs to keep her strength

for me to have afterwards  i hate cod   i have prepared the razor  nurse lee will give you a shave   i did it myself  this morning  after i had the show   you shaved yourself   i know the drill  sister  this is my fourth   i suppose you gave yourself an enema to boot   i don't want an enema  it's not dignified   if you were that keen on your dignity  you wouldn't be here now   blasted chimney   high  hot and a hell of a lot   i hope you're ready with that po   excuse me  nurse  is that the afterbirth   no  baby isn't here yet   fair enough   only when you're done and dusted   i'd like the afterbirth to take down the allotment   brings my tomatoes on lovely   i'm too tired for all of this   come on  muriel  where's all that fighting talk  no cod  no enemas   no eddy  i meant it about eddy   don't you go pulling a fast one on me   muriel  no father has ever been allowed in one of my delivery rooms  and no father ever shall be   and there go the waters   splendid  nurse lee  we will change the bed   no  stay where you are  nurse lee and i will roll you   that's it   i'm fed up with having babies  i'm only twenty three   there's newspaper under here   well  saves on laundry and lets the mattress live another day   you're not in a hospital now  with cupboards full of spotless linen   come on  it's quicker to do it myself   look  get rid of that   and sort that fire out  it's not drawing properly   yes  sister   nurse lee   yes  you stick with me  love   i'm an old hand   well done  you  well done   i can see the baby's head   we're going to turn you onto your side  into the correct  position for delivery  and then i want you to listen to nurse lee   that's the way   excellent  right knee tucked up under the chin   that's it  good girl   see how it all comes flooding back   little push now  muriel  little push     don't push too hard     and that's it  the head is born   is it nearly here   yes  it is   you're almost done   well done   well done   well done  well done   and that's it   you have a little boy   i'm that proud of you  i could burst   what's happening   i'll swing for that bleedin' sweep   is he all right  is he all right   baby's in fine fettle  he's fast asleep   i meanwhile am lathered in soot  right down to my drawers   me too   i haven't got any on   we need to clamp and cut the cord  nurse lee   why the delay  i'm sorry  come along   sometimes we need to deal with what the lord has sent us   you must be back first thing in the morning  to do the routine checks   i'll wait for you by the west ferry bridge   mr g  all right  sister   bravo  all pink and white again   still  they always say soot is good  clean dirt   the soot was the least of my worries   i've never seen conditions like it   quite  the first time i saw an east end bathroom  i actually shook   bathroom  you were lucky   little did i know   i mean  tap on the tenement landing  some of them   sister evangelina never turns a hair  she grew up very poor   somewhere near reading   are you decent  we're all in our unmentionables   the sight will make your day   this is fred  our handyman   you won't be able to resist his charm  good day off yesterday   i've had better   do you like toffee apples   not really   i'm thinking of going into toffee apples   fred has a wide range of sidelines  some of which are actually legal   you can keep your aspersions to yourself  young madam   i'm not complaining  we thoroughly enjoyed your alcoholic ginger beer   it was just a shame you sold some to those children   there's no point in discussing it  for you cannot understand   brewing is a science  there was error of exactitude   cigarette   you really do have the most lovely hands   do you play the piano   i've played since i was tiny  but nursing doesn't leave much room for practice   no   i have this fantasy about painting my nails   cherry red talons  gleaming in the light   one day  i won't be able to resist it any longer   i'll chuck out my rubber gloves  the carbolic soap  and that infernal nailbrush   trade it all in for lashings of atrixo and a proper manicure   but not yet   absolutely not yet  there's work to be done   i can still smell cabbage from the pensioners' luncheon club   one week we were weighing babies  and there was still an old man in the corner finishing off his mince   not to mention madame enid's dancing class comes in at half past five   excellent  aspirin  why  have you got a headache   no  i've lost a button off my suspender belt   i ought to get garters  really  like the nuns   i've seen them in the laundry room  drying  quite vile   have you come to see mum  we're about to have our tea   all right then  kids  what are we going to have tonight   how about a lovely boiled pillow case     no    i fancy some fried pyjama bottoms   no  we had pyjama bottoms last night   i'm hoping it's underpant soup   we had that last night   vamos  mama  estamos con hambre   abracadabra  ole   not stew and dumplings again   nurse  you going to join us  look   coma  coma   she says   eat up  eat up   do as you're told   there are no plates   we never use them  tuck in  nurse   cor  that don't half pen and ink  nurse   i don't know why you're bothering   conchita's ankles are swollen   when that happens we have to check for a condition called pre eclampsia   by looking for signs of protein in the urine   pre eclampsia  is that the same as toxaemia   yes  it is   well  then you ain't got to bother with the test  nurse   sister bernadette says you can't get  toxaemia except with your first and second   we're on our 25th  conchita's ankles are swollen   well  sister bernadette used to say that it was  cos she was on her feet   perhaps you could persuade conchita to lie down for an hour or so each day   with her legs slightly elevated   i'll tell maureen to tell her   i take my hat off to the kids  i mean  even the nippers can do it   i was never much good with the foreign lingo   you don't speak spanish   no  there's never no need  no   conchita and me  we understand each other   mrs merrick   hello  muriel   hello  pearl  long time no see   i've just come in for my check up  he's my fourth   that's a lovely hat  you can pass it my way once his head gets too big   your youngest's just weed on the floor   yeah  i know  we're toilet training him  but it's all right  he ain't got no pants to wet   mrs winston   keep an eye on them for me  will you   first lie down i've had all day   i see you're 32 weeks pregnant   i shall need you to do a urine sample for me   can't you just examine me first  i've only just got comfy   i keep having twinges  on and off   well  let's take a look at you  shall we   i've got some shocking discharge   heels to bottom  knees nice and wide apart   are you aware of this   little lump in my downbelows  yeah  it's been there a while   i can't really reach it now   your face  you reckon i've got a dose  don't you   i'll have to    check with someone more senior   i'm afraid the lump in her vulva appears to be a syphilitic chancre   other symptoms support the diagnosis   and of course the foetus is at risk  dr turner is already on his way   i imagine he will prescribe a course of penicillin   nurse   you won't catch anything   how could she not have known   how could she have felt that thing and never cared   pearl winston isn't accustomed to caring   or  indeed  being cared about  how can you be so calm   when i was new to district practice   i often found it hard to conquer my revulsion   i'm sorry  i didn't know people lived like this   but they do   and it's why we're here   tea's on its way  you look as though you need a cup   can i smell smog   there's a mist closing in   it's coming up off the river  and that ain't an encouraging sign   temperature out there's dropping like a stone   no good looking in there   there was a cherry sponge but guess who's had it   there is frost fingering its way beneath the door into the hall   you must take these into bed with you   you are young  you see  and your vibrations will stimulate the corms   they were mistaken into thinking spring had come   i am very much afraid that they will die   and the demise of something barely born goes against  the sacred nature of our calling   sister monica joan   what about the bowl   but it would be missed   by sister evangelina   i am sure we do not wish to unleash the beast   dr turner wanted you to start the injections straightaway   he'll need to see your husband  too  and arrange the same treatments for him   where are you going to put the needle  leg or arse   in your bottom  i'm afraid   i should have been a stripper   i mean  at least i'd have met a better class of man   mum  mama  mama   mum   mum   help  mum   help   room service   strictly entre nous  i could murder a dubonnet   but we're both on call  so horlicks is our lot   did you find it hard  when you first came here   i thought i deserved all manner of medals  up all night   cycling for miles  a wall of wimples at every single meal time   and then one day i realised   i didn't deserve any medals at all   the mothers are the brave ones   baby after baby  in abominable conditions  and they keep on going   they're the heroines  i'm just here to help   you will find your feet   you ought to come out with cynthia and i   they have these tremendous dances  down at the church hall   unless  of course  you already have a chap   no  do you   what  have a chap   well  i used to go out with this curate called roger   but he couldn't be seen in the parish with a woman on his arm   we had to catch separate buses all the way to  monument before we were even permitted to hold hands   i can't tell you how tedious it was   i thought you might be pining after some beastly absentee boyfriend   no   are you sure   there's a look about you  that's all   a look that only the lovelorn have   i've loved someone since i was 17   but i can't have him   and i can't give him up   so until i can do that  no one else will stand a chance   nonnatus house  nurse lee speaking   conchita took a tumble in the yard  we think she's got concussion   mr warren  you should call the doctor  not a midwife   no  we keep calling but we can't get any answer   can you get her to a hospital   no  you can't see hand in front of your face out here   'it's you we need now  not him '  she's in labour   waters are still intact  the pains are about every five minutes   mr warren must know labour when he sees it   the birth won't be remarkable  but such a  premature baby is unlikely to survive  even if  the ambulance arrives on time  has it been sent for   the obstetrics flying squad are on their way   dr turner will meet you at the house   have you delivered a stillborn baby before   in training  under supervision   i should go with her   no  i have a complex case to go to   and who knows what else the night might bring   worst fog in five years   hurry up  it's a bit of a step   come on  nurse   you'll be all right   god be with you   good luck   you still there  nurse   just about   not far now   she never screams like this  she always keeps her head   has the doctor not arrived yet  no   we ain't never lost one before  nurse   sometimes we have to deal with what the lord has sent us   all right   the concussion is preventing her from recognising the pain as labour   she doesn't know what's happening  she's too scared to co operate   all right  my love  we'll soon be done  i promise you   i don't think it will be long now   the urge to push will overtake her  whether  she knows what's happening or not   you need to be prepared   how easily will it come away   i wish the ambulance would come   if you come with me  maureen  help get your mum onto her side   get me the bowl  please  maureen   i've got you  my darling  i've got you  i've got you   you can go downstairs for me now  maureen  boil me some water  please   don't ask me if she's all right because i don't know   well  she's gone limp   she's going into shock   we need to keep her warm   we don't know when help will arrive  and she's still losing blood   you're doing perfect  my darling  you are doing perfect   it's even weaker   bebe   no bebe  not this time  my beautiful   it's alive  nurse   i didn't wrap him up  he'll be so cold   wrap him now   it's a little boy  come on  little one  come on   come on  little one  come on   what's happened   you've got another brother   he's smaller than a doll  how's he still alive   i don't know   me nino  donde esta mi nino   she's saying  my baby  where's my baby    el esta acqui  la matrona se le ha secado   i said he's here  i said you were just drying him   you must tell her that it's very small and fragile   es muy pequeno  muy fragil  todos los ninos son fragiles   she says   all babies are fragile    no    no  what's up  tell me what to do   she needs ergometrin  what's that   straight upstairs  mind out the road  kids   the children are to stay out of the way   what happens now  nurse   we need the rest of the afterbirth to come away  or she might need surgery   she ain't never been to hospital  she's had all 25 of them at home  25   if you value her life  you will let us do what's best   the name's turner  patient's gp  sorry  i was delayed   three bronchitis patients  one after the other   we  meanwhile  have a haemorrhaging mother  and a viable neonate   this young midwife's been very capable  well done  can i help   take over on the oxygen   call great ormond street  tell them to prepare for a 30 weeker  yes  sir   and you can bring the ventilator from the ambulance   ventilator  great ormond street   he needs help  he might need to be tube fed   that's it  it's out  check it   lips pinking up  and the baby's still breathing   thank god  i'm all for giving medals to the gentleman upstairs  sir   but in this case credit should go to the national health   ten years ago we would have had none of this   no obstetric flying squad  no ambulance  no chance   placenta's complete  sir  stabilising   she'll need a further transfusion  but we can do that here   right  let's take this little chap  get him sorted out   no  maureen  tell her  he's got to go to hospital   mama  el para estar en el hopital  no   el necesita  morira  morira   i said he'll die  he'll die  morira  mama   se queda conmingo   she says   he stays with me    tell her she needs blood  penicillin and rest at home   the baby will be treated in the finest children's hospital in england   mama  necesita sangre  e    se queda conmingo   yu soy su hopital  el is mi sangre   she says   he stays with me    i am his hospital  he is my blood    no morira   no  no morira   may we come in   yeah  you're just in time to see him take his milk   you wait till you see his little tongue come out   ain't no bigger than a daisy petal   what is that  that's something maureen uses in domestic science   she says it's an icing rod   how often has he been fed   every half an hour since seven o'clock this morning   six or eight drops  he has  just sort of licks them down   then she tucks him back in her nightie   we have no experience of caring for such babies   in the olden days  they did not live   and now  they're nursed in a hospital   not this one   we won't send the baby to hospital  will we  sister  no   we'll visit three times a day for the first six weeks  and then every day for as long as is required   only time will tell whether conchita will succeed   we must see what love can do   it frightens me  seeing him without his little nightie on   his ribs is that delicate  they look like kipper bones   i seen an incubator baby in a newsreel once   looked like a landed fish  it did   laying on its
