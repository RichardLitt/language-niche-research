   louis    hello  stanley   what on earth are you doing here   l needed somewhere to come to  naturally  l thought of you   you might have given me a little warning   you've cut your hand   you

just cut up a pillow case   it's all l could find in the bedroom     still sleeping at work  l see    sometimes  of course   that'll do for now  but you ought to see a doctor   thank you  yes  l will

any idea what we should do   not yet  no   well  we're pretty sure nobody knows you're  here  and we want to keep it that way   so we should play the loudest record we've got   help us think  stop us being heard   lt has to be one of yours  doesn't it   this seems appropriate   mm  good choice     you have to go  stanley     any minute  l've just got to finish this  mick   up here  mick   you'll never do it  unless you go now     she's finished with those pages    almost finished     and you can take these too    er   no  he can't   l have to retype everything  stanley  because you go at such a rate   she thinks l make mistakes  mick  l never make mistakes   you have to go  you've got to get to the olympia  the cafe royal and the apollo   and then there's that little club in lyle lane     that's the only important one    you have to run  stanley   good evening  l hope you had a nice time   lovely to see you again  hope you enjoyed yourself   good evening  gentlemen  thank you very much   good night     good night  ladies  very nice to see you again     excuse me   good night  gentlemen  terrific  aren't they   oh  that's a tremendous sound  deirdre  they were sensational   don't you dare  stanley  you've just arrived  you missed them   l missed them  they've finished  what   that's impossible   mwah  l heard enough to be interested   you liar  where are you going     l'm going to see them    they'll know you missed it     but you think they're terrific  don't you     l think they're very exciting  yes   and unusual too   that's good enough for me  then   gentlemen     gentlemen   forgive the intrusion  l couldn't stop myself   l just had to tell you   that was terrific  absolutely terrific     and you are       stanley mitchell  of music express   yes  that was a very exciting evening  tremendous   and unusual   we didn't see you in there  where were you   l have a habit of slipping into places unnoticed   so  you're a critic  then   l write profiles  features and reviews   so  what were we playing when you    when you slipped in   oh  it was a lovely little number   no  l didn't catch its name   l'm looking for a band to play the lmperial hotel next friday   l wouldn't be about to recommend you for that job if l hadn't heard you   no  we're out of town next friday night  on tour   on tour  really     where are you going    we are on tour   and even if it were possible to change that   the lmperial  that old place   oh  they want a ''coloured'' band  huh   who do l give this to     you give it to me    right   l know what you're getting to play here   and l know what they pay at the lmperial     and you give it to him    oh   louis leads the band and writes the music   l deal with everything else that comes up  and l mean everything else   and you'll get a free meal  as well   we'll let you know   oh  and you'll need full evening dress  of course   l can arrange a very good rate  if you'd like me to   hold it there   we're the louis lester band     looking for our dressing rooms    the louis lester band   yes  l was warned you were coming   musicians booked for one night only normally wait  in that room up there next to the telephone   what have they got in here   by all means  help yourselves  gentlemen   the soup should still be reasonably warm   can you hear that   that is the hot sound of the jack paynton orchestra   the most over booked band ever   you're on after the dullest music in london    shouldn't be too difficult to wake them up     l've got a bad feeling about tonight    ah  absolutely not   here   look at this  you're in here already   one of my top tips of the week   near the bottom of the page   right  this is where l leave you  best of luck   they've never had a coloured band here  have they   oh  it's better than that   l don't think  they've ever had jazz music before   goodness knows why mr schlesinger let you do this  stanley   he let me do it because of them   look at them  harry  look at your clientele   something's got to change     good evening  mr donaldson    hello  stanley     mr luscombe    hello   miss sarah  pamela  thank you one and all for coming   l read your column  stanley  and you see   here l am   so  somebody believes what l write  l'd love to hear your opinion   l hope l shall have an opinion  stanley   mr mitchell      pleasure   hello  l'm julian  everybody decent  can we come in   of course   this is pamela  my sister  and her friend  sarah   and this is mr donaldson   he's a connoisseur of your kind of music     a great authority  in fact     that was terrific music to dance to  thank you   thank you for dancing  l thought nobody was going to   don't be silly  lt was the least we could do  gentlemen   lt was divine   well   l think it was probably the most disastrous booking we've ever had   no  gentlemen  the audience maybe were a little surprised     they couldn't believe their eyes     but l thought you were excellent  no  l did   sometimes my friend stanley here exaggerates   but in your case l don't think he is   l do  as it happens  have one piece of advice   get yourself a singer     a singer    yes   lt might make all the difference to your chances   just a thought  gentlemen  merely a notion   l don't want to interfere  naturally   l will of course spread the word   talking of which   do you want to come and watch me write my review   do you let a lot of bands watch you write your reviews   absolutely not  l wouldn't let most musicians come near this office     so  why us    cos you're different   cos you're not jack paynton  for one thing   and because l've been given the job of making  the lmperial a little more fashionable   which is the sort of challenge l like   so my reasons are purely selfish  naturally   so  how many people read your magazine  cos l never have   more than you might think  and we're growing   does it matter what l write  l think it probably does   ah  forgive me   l have to finish this as well   l always do two things at once   come and see what you think so far   ''the atmosphere was simply electric   as the louis lester band took to the stage  in the old ballroom at the lmperial hotel ''  ''electric''  they hated us  that wasn't electric   lt was for me  and that's what matters   ''one of our first ever home grown coloured  bands shook the room with their intensity   and showed that this kind of music could appeal to a much larger audience  than it presently enjoys ''  you are home grown   that's right  isn't it   yes  in a way  l was born here     so was l    lost his birth certificate   lt's gone missing  l got to find it some day   l was born in cardiff   but my father   he took us to chicago when l was four years old   ah  you're from the midwest  wesley   yes   until l had to leave in a hurry   we met in a club in harlem   l was there for five days without a break  watching every act   we didn't leave the club   l was on shore leave  l was working in the  merchant navy on a liner  the aurora   l told wesley to come to england and see if  we could make something happen in london   most of the band have worked on ships one time   sailors or cooks   or stowaways   all of us have to report every week to the alien registration office   except louis  cos he's got the right documents     hang on  you have to do that every week     every week  yes   to get a work permit  they only give them to you week by week   of course  if we had a regular booking at the lmperial  that might help   then l'd better finish my review  hadn't l     what is this    l need to do the speech bubbles  for our strip cartoon farquhar and tonk   albert can't finish it until l've done the bubbles   one of the most important things we've got   farquhar's an inquisitive aristocrat and tonk is his valet   who happens to come from outer space  and together they have adventures   now  we need a big finish here for the review   what l really should say is     get yourself a singer  louis    there where my heart is yearning ever that's what the old folks say   all around is down and dreary   everywhere l go   still looking for the old temptation   that's what the old folks say  thank you   l know  l know  we're not having any of this terrible west end singing    when the sun refused to shine   when the sun refused to shine   l would like to be in that number   just a closer walk with me   grant me  jesus    she looked like she could sing    until she opened her mouth   thank you  you've got to go   everybody  it's time to go     lt's the day they have to report    oh  there's plenty of time   no  she's waiting for her friend to arrive   she won't sing till then   go  you've got to get to woburn square  lt's nearly four o'clock   l think the old man was best   we should go for the oldest singer we can find   run  wesley   they like to cut it as fine as they can   l can sing now    ln sunny roseland   where summer breezes are playing   where the honey bees are a maying   there   all the roses are swaying   somewhere in roseland   beside a beautiful rose  she's got the better voice   l know     lt's both of us or nothing    both of you   l don't think that will be a problem   what are you thinking   well  apart from     l think farquhar and tonk could do with a bit of romance   there's nobody here to answer that  stanley   somebody really wants you  stanley  and they're not going to give up     music express    oh  you are still at work  stanley   mr donaldson  yes  yes  l'm still at work     one of those nights you sleep there  is it     that seems to be the case  yes     l need your help  stanley    but of course     l'm having a lunch party in five days' time     am l invited   you could be  lt depends if you can help me   l have a very important   and l mean extremely  important   guest coming  who loves jazz music     who is it    i can't teii you that   l had booked leslie thompson  but now he's ill  and they've had to cancel   i don't quite know what to do  staniey   weii  this is perfect timing   the band you saw the other day at the imperiai    they've taken your advice and they've hired a fabuious singer  two  in fact     are they your top recommendation  stanley     yes     be embarrassing if it went wrong    they won't disappoint you     you're certain  stanley    am i certain   absolutely   you   get out of bed  down the alien registration office   lt's five in the morning  what do you want  to do this for at five in the morning   you   stand over there   you didn't report  did you  you didn't report     they were shut    huh     they were shut early  l swear to you     l told you not to leave it to the last minute   l see you're ready to go  come on  then     l'm a british citizen    since when   since l was born here   this is not looking good   are you gentlemen the musicians     that's us    do you have a spokesman     that'll be me    could you please follow me   l don't require that  mr lester   l know you have an english birth certificate   under the terms of the work permits granted to the performers in your band   they have to report every week  this week they did not     lt's the first time they've missed a week     lf we allow that excuse   the system would quickly fall apart   would it not   lf people could choose the week they wanted to report     what do they need to do    normally  we require proof in writing  they have employment as musicians for the  following week before we can issue a permit   but because there has been this transgression of the rules   l now require written proof of three weeks' employment   proof of three weeks' employment   lf l don't receive that by the end of today   your colleagues will be detained in custody  pending possible deportation   lf you don't think you can produce that  it  would save us all time if you told me now   l will be able to produce that   today we close at 5 1 5     lt's getting late  louis    don't worry   don't worry   nobody's safe  l'd better find my damn birth certificate     yes  you had     because l do not want to go back to the us   no  sir  that could not happen     should l tell her the truth    wesley     missy     had a little trouble in chicago  lies were told   don't be stupid  stop this   you don't think she want to hear that l was  accused of sleeping with a white woman   and that the white woman's husband said that l raped his wife   and that carries the death penalty in chicago   because l think she might be very interested   missy     l was born here  so that makes me english   welsh  in fact   so  gentlemen  l have here a four week booking   in writing  from the lmperial  for their inspection     four weeks    told you l'd fix it     why was it that easy    who said it was easy   lt was not  you don't know mr schlesinger   thank you   we got the proof   there's a nice little extra   mr donaldson's having a garden party  with a special guest of honour   whose identity is being kept secret even from me   a secret guest   who is it  clark gable   what a garden  does it belong to just one house   there you are  exactly on time  good   of course   enjoy yourselves out here  start playing in 45 minutes     ls the mystery guest of honour here yet     lf he likes you  you may get to see him    when l dream of you   dream the whole night through   l awake and softly whisper   l'm quite in love with you   when l dream of you   dream the whole night through   when l dream of   you   truckin' along  and l'm happy to see you   ain't right or wrong if l do or l don't   l'm holdin' on for a dance at the voodoo   crazy in a mood for love   never say you won't be leaving   you can buy me time and teasing   you can show me ways of pleasing   crazy in a mood for love   crazy in love and l'm lookin' to make it   this is a chance and l'm going to take it   down at the hop  and who cares if you fake it    crazy in a mood for love   never say you won't be leaving   you can buy me time and teasing   l can show you ways of pleasing   crazy in a mood for love   crazy in love  crazy in love   crazy in a mood for love    he wants to meet you    who's he   prince george  fourth son of the king     the son of the king    what do we call him   your royal highness   and you don't speak until you're spoken to   come here  come here  please   you must tell us all about yourselves   where on earth did you learn to sing like that   well  jessie's always been able to sing  ever since she was tiny at school   yes  since school   since you were tiny at school   is that right   eat like royalty   your band are clearly absolutely starving   l like the look of your mr lester   quite surprising  really   he seems an educated man  doesn't he  the way he conducts himself   unlike me  you mean   yes  he's   he's quite a character   l couldn't take your picture in the garden  could l   and any other member of the band that would like to   now the sun's come out  l'd like to do some portrait shots   of course   but l couldn't stop them eating right now   l'll come   you look lovely today   lt's not just the prince that's here today  you know   some people say he's one of the richest men in the world  from the us   managed not to lose everything in the crash  ln fact   he even made money while it was happening   l'm working for him at the moment  just helping out   but he says he might have something bigger for me   l must try to talk to him   go on   sing something for me now  a little song  just right here  please   you want her to sing now    your royal highness     sing what    anything you like   sit here    lord  lead me on   lord  lead me on   lead me across the river   lead me on  so  stanley  you really do have an eye for talent   of course l do  don't you read the magazine   l read music express every week  as it happens   you do  l didn't know you were so keen on music   l'm interested in all sorts of things  stanley   not just clothes and men   l read your magazine from cover to cover   and it all seems to be written by you   most of it  yes   even the diary of the chorus girl in the west end show   well  that was sort of a   collaboration   don't you have an editor who orders you around   l do have an editor  yes   mr wax   but he seems to like what l do   you know  you always surprise me  stanley   well  that's good     that is good  isn't it    yes  l like daring people    the path ahead  what a pity you can't write about this   the royal prince and a jazz band   what a story that would make   but even you can't do that   stanley told me about your trouble with the immigration authorities   yes  well  the rules are very strict   especially if you've worked on the ships   some of them get followed sometimes   people checking to see if they really are musicians   followed in the street  really   not many people realise that goes on  but it's  quite a regime  the alien registration office   well  my father's russian  and he gets some strange looks sometimes       people thinking he might be a soviet spy   so  maybe l understand more than you think   maybe l see a bit more of the world than pamela   she's my friend  but l work for her  really   l choose her clothes  l design some of them     which means l actually have to go into shops   warehouses even  looking for materials   l'm sure you've guessed  but l'm no aristocrat  louis   l'm not sure l had guessed that  no   thank you  joe   you're next  louis   the band must play again  prince george has requested it     l love your music    thank you   l hope you don't mind me saying that  l love your band   l'm hopeless  ls it hopeless   l really think it is hopeless   isn't it   of course not  your royal highness    feel the heat of the city beat   feel the thing of the swing   tapping our feet where the nighthawks meet   l can't help it   it's got a grip on me   rent is due and cash is tight  a little more full tonight   not bad at all  lt's been building all week   l knew l was right to tell them to get a singer    hear the blare of the thoroughfare  come and look at this   lamb chops   meat  for the first time   we must be doing something right  then   they never gave us this wine before   maybe this mr slazenger  or whatever he's called   is beginning to like us   louis  sorry to butt in like this   could you come with me for a moment   l need your help   no  no  no  lt's very kind  but l just need louis   thank god you were still here   mr masterson has asked me to do something   this is mr masterson's suite  he gave me the key  l have it somewhere   yes   he's left the hotel   now  louis  if you feel you're unable to help  say so at once   and of course l'll understand   but if you do feel able to help  l'll be so terribly grateful     what happened here    l don't know  he said it would be like this   l don't know what he's been doing   what a mess   hello   mr masterson asked if l'd clear this up   l didn't know it would be this bad  l mean  not quite as bad as this   l know l shouldn't involve you  louis  but l can't do this on my own   please leave  if you need to   mr masterson will pay for the damage to the room  of course     what do we need to do     we need to get the girl out of the hotel   lf we use the kitchen entrance  if l get a taxi  and you take the girl       what's your name    hannah   are we there yet    shhh   you  l'm talking to you   don't you run away from me  come back here  how dare you   l just want to get out of here    shhh     the best thing is to own up to it     are we there yet    shhh   shhh     still here  mr lester    yes   l'm leaving now  l've been going through the music for tomorrow   oh  l see   well  l'll be writing a report for mr schlesinger   l think he might be rather pleased with tonight   do we ever get to meet mr schlesinger   that all depends  mr lester  that all depends     good night    night   look   l think my car is coming   there you are  marvellous   thank you  louis   mr masterson will be pleased   l'm incredibly grateful   you're wonderful  my friend     music express  what can l do for you    stanley  it's louis   something strange just happened with julian and mr masterson   there was a giri in mr masterson's suite at the hotei   she was in a bad way  the room was all smashed up too     so  quite a party     l helped julian get her out of the hotel   where was mr masterson during this   l don't know  l didn't see him   he asked julian to clear up for him   people like that always can vanish when they want to  can't they   l don't know if l should have helped  l mean  the girl  she was     are you worried about her   yes  i am   well  if you're worried about her  louis  we'll have to find her   mr julian knows you're here  he'll be with you in a moment   one day  you'll have a house like this   of course   and how do you see that happening   well  it won't be long before your records  are available in every store in the land   that'll be good  considering we haven't made a single one yet   l'll be just walking down the street  and your  music will be coming out of every other window   and when l come to see you  when you've got a house like this     you'll be shown to the tradesmen's entrance   naturally  yes   stanley  louis  lt's wonderful to see you  please   there you are  what a lovely way to start the day   start  lt's nearly two o'clock  pamela   oh  it's as early as that  is it  l thought it was later   lt's wicked  l know  but l've only just got up   what a strange evening last night was   louis was absolutely wonderful  has he told you   he has  we were just wondering what happened to the girl     she's here    with her gigantic bruises   l was so clumsy last night  and so utterly drunk  l just kept falling over   goodness knows what people must think   l'm enormously grateful to you  and so is mr masterson   oh  yes  mr masterson's having a picnic   you really must join us   yes  he'd love you to join him  ln fact  the whole  band  if they're available   to be his guests   lt's his way of saying a huge thank you   the whole band  really  they're all invited   well  whoever wants to come  they might enjoy it   he plans them very carefully   l shan't be there myself  sadly  my parents are coming to town   oh  you must come  please say you will   lt would make his picnic so much more jolly   and you'll come  stanley  won't you   oh  l'm invited too  am l   of course  l'm inviting you   mr masterson tends to picnic on a grand scale   lt's not something you'd want to miss   on a grand scale   does that mean a lot of rolls royces setting  off for a destination that only he knows   nearly right  there's going to be some  interesting transport  but not rolls royces   oh   this is amazing   our own private train     l didn't think l'd have a compartment to myself     we really are his guests   don't have to sing for our supper     not unless we want to    well  you don't  stanley     what's your compartment like    oh  you know     velvet cushions  bowl of chocolates    bowl of chocolates   not sure l got that   come in  gentlemen  soup is being served   and we're all absolutely starving   ls anybody sitting here   no  by all means   sit down  we're going to be waited on     nobody knows where we're going    nobody  no   do you think that can be true   yes  he likes his mystery picnics   ls it easy  mr masterson  to hire a private train   quite easy  once you know who to ask   but you have to tell someone the exact route you're going to take     you must have to do that  surely    what makes you think that    my man's gone away   left me feelin' blue   no good tryin' to chase him   cos he's run straight back to you  l think what you've done  mr lester  is truly extraordinary   what l've done  and what is that  mr donaldson   how you've made this band from nothing     how he's made it    l'm very intrigued  by how you've managed to meld it all together in a very sophisticated way   if you don't mind me saying so   you've taken the best of what you've heard from america and made it your own   how did you learn to do that   l'm sorry   that sounded much too patronising   l think it was my experience on the ocean liners that helped me so much   and when you were playing on the liners and people were dancing   did they ever say things to you     say things    when you were on a big ship together     with all those people    rich people   yes  you must have bumped into them when you weren't playing    like when you were coming off stage   did you have to put up with them being rather horrible   you must have had to deal with a lot of prejudiced people   of course  yes   and you never know where it's going to come from   sometimes it's the people you don't expect   l remember bumping into a table when l was  coming off the stage on one of the crossings   and the couple nearest to me    and the lady  she was covered in jewels   but she was very young and charming looking   and both of them  this couple  started wiping their cutlery with their napkins   even though l wasn't anywhere near them   they changed them a few minutes later too     just to be sure   oh  that's very revealing  wiping their cutlery   you should do that to them next time   when certain people walk really close to your  table  you should start cleaning your fork   see how they react to that   there's so much ignorance  isn't there   and you're right  mr lester   sometimes  it's those who seem to be the most educated  who turn out to be quite the most ignorant  the most prejudiced   but we don't know what's going to happen next   maybe things are about to change   despite all the hardship there is  l feel     and l hope l'm not being too optimistic  mr lester   but l do feel that anything is possible now   oh  l'm sorry  l got the wrong compartment  mr masterson   do forgive me   gold   gold is the safest thing at the moment   l like to have some with me at all times   so l know  if something happens  l will still have a roof over my head   there you are   you're not writing about this before it's even happened  are you   before what's even happened   l love trains   don't you   absolutely   please   go on working   l like to see that   l so rarely watch anybody work   l'm not putting you off  am l     you most certainly are    well  try not to be   l'm sure you overcome most distractions  stanley   usually  that's true   you don't think l can be serious  do you  stanley  about anything   go on  lie  why not     of course you can    thank you   ls this some of that strange cartoon you have in your magazine   mm hm   farquhar and tonk  l rather like that   they went on an ocean liner last week  didn't they  and met a jazz band   so  mr lester's having an effect on your strip cartoon  stanley   l grab material from wherever l can  l'm afraid   always have done   so  we might find ourselves in it soon  l might be there     you might     and you can send your farquhar and tonk  anywhere you like in the world   just like that   to the moon  even   and we could all follow them there   l could do that   lf l wanted   and what's stopping you   might be fun   you don't have to play now  you know     you want me to stop    no  of course not   you were invited as a guest  weren't you   you don't need to play for your supper   you're saying they didn't expect any music   well  maybe a little  yes   of course they did   and more than a little    doo doo doo  the train's moving   we have to stop just because the train's moving   lt's lucky  isn't it   now we don't need to worry about all the noise we're going to make   yes   lt's just that l have no idea where we're going   why does that matter   l think it's marvellous not knowing   are we in the middle of nowhere  stanley   looks like it  yes   splendid   l can't imagine a better place to be   you must excuse my idea of how to picnic   but l've invented my own version  since l feel the cold when l'm outside   so  l always picnic indoors  always   but l make sure the view is constantly changing   that's why picnicking on a train is such a good idea   mr masterson would like you to know   in case you're wondering where we're going   there is no destination     no destination    no   we'll have lunches in the woods and candle lit dinners by the sea   but we'll be on the train the whole time   and maybe we never get back to town   yes  let's all live on the train   l'm going to risk getting frozen and go outside  if that's not forbidden   yes  yes  that's allowed   l'd really like to do that portrait we never had time to do   if you could spare a moment   here   ls this all right   lt's good  yes   l know you think there's something wrong with  all of this  with mr masterson's hospitality     did l say anything    you didn't have to   but maybe he really means it   it's not just a rich man's whim   and he won't move on to something else next week   no  l don't think so     he really loves your music    really  he does   he looks a funny old bird  l know   but he goes to nearly every party   never goes to bed   he likes to watch the young people   not just watching   pamela told me about hannah   l wouldn't want to be alone with him   certainly  but she adores him  apparently   people's private lives   one never really knows what goes on  does one   l know this is my second plate  but l may never  have a breakfast like this again in my whole life   so l'm going to keep eating     yes  we could all be in the gutter tomorrow     please don't say that  of course you won't   but that could happen quite easily  couldn't it  mr donaldson   l'm sure that won't happen  no  mr holt  not after you've made such a start   l'm glad you think that   but there is a way to make very sure that it doesn't happen  isn't there     what's that  then    by having a proper contract   and not a week by week arrangement   l'm sure in time that will happen  these things tend to evolve naturally   oh  they ''evolve naturally''  do they   well     l agree  and since we only have two weeks  left of our booking at the lmperial   l think it will be natural  very natural  in fact   to ask mr schlesinger for a six month contract   so we become the regular band at the lmperial   six months  nobody gets six months   jack paynton doesn't get six months  wally dix doesn't get six months   we get a six month contract  or we going to offer our services to the savoy     mr masterson    just wondered how you were doing   come out here and have your picture taken   ln fact  can everyone come out and l'll take  their picture  tell everyone to come out   come on  everybody  to the front of the train   hurry up  the light's great out here   just all gather round   l wonder what he's been up to during breakfast   lt's not wise to leave wesley on his own   ok   a three month contract is my final offer     six    six months is out of the question   three months  or l find another band to take your place   six months   l won't do business like this  young man   l come here to meet you  as you asked   something l've rarely done for any other band   and three months is my final offer   and mr holt  it is in fact a very good offer   my advice would be to consider it very carefully   six months  or we go to the savoy  mr schlesinger   well  the savoy won't take you   you won't find things nearly as easy out there as you think     four months    louis   no   four months   or we will go elsewhere   four months   l may be able  just  to consider four months     and our accommodation  of course    what about your accommodation   l think that can be negotiated separately   we're going to need new accommodation  and that goes without saying   and where might that be   at the lmperial  of course   come on   it's this way   that's right  keep going   come on  all the way up   so  these are the rooms usually given over to performers   accommodation can only be provided for four weeks   we shall review the situation after that   l will call your room numbers and hand you your keys   but first  l would like you to pay particular  attention to the rules of the hotel   you may under no circumstances use the main  entrance or the main lobby at any time   nor may you go into any of the lounges  dining rooms or bars   unless  of course  you are performing there   and you may not entertain guests of any kind   of any kind   in your rooms   ls that understood   our own room in a hotel  wow  l never thought that would happen   and just think of the meals  hot meals every day   yes  l've been hungry ever since l can remember  l really think l have   but not any more   all being well  that is   tonight l think we should look fabulous  really fabulous   yes  to make sure they don't change their mind   waiter     she's incredible  isn't she   can't take my eyes off her   we had noticed  julian   sarah helped them choose their new clothes  you know   mr donaldson paid for them  she looks good  doesn't she    remember all those bad times   you told me that you'd never leave her   do   do you think she'll ever like me    sending me those love lines you were happy to deceive her  l need to find something to really impress her    now you're here to stay   l promise we'll have good times   you'll whisper that you'll never leave me   send me all those love lines    you're always late  stanley     l still have a magazine to write  remember    now you're here to stay always  this is terrific  look at their faces   yes  the dear old hotel doesn't know what's hit it   that's so true   stanley  you know the freemasons have temples in this hotel     they don't    oh  yes  in the basement   l wonder what they'd think of this   talking of strangely dressed people  my mum wants to meet louis   really  stanley  that's very charming  how come   because she likes the sound of him    send me all those love lines   now you're here to stay   now you're here to stay always   now you're here to stay always    hello  mum    hello     this is louis    hello   come in   the food is to your liking  is it   not going to disagree with your digestion   lt's all right  mum  louis eats everything   lt's delicious  mrs mitchell   oh  l quite forgot the lemonade   no  no  you stay there   l must get the lemonade   l made it specially     you didn't tell her    tell her what   you were bringing a black man to the house   of course not  lt's good for her to have a surprise   you said you'd told her all about our music   l did  but she thinks dance bands are white   l hope to hear your music  mr lester   l would be very interested in doing that   well  l'm going to try and persuade louis and the band  to come and play in the garden here one sunday afternoon   well  maybe not in the garden   the neighbours might not like that   not on a sunday   who knows  we might get the whole street dancing   always keep a bottle hidden away for when l drop by   my mum doesn't approve of liquor  bless her   now  there's only one glass       so l'll have the bottle   these records are old   are they the first ones you ever bought   some of them  yes  snoop away  by all means   lt's always good to see people's childhood  bedrooms   you can tell a lot from them   probably started a magazine at school   course l did  l wrote and performed music there as well   formed my own little band  and then gave it  rave reviews in the magazine l'd started     you were in a hurry  even then     oh  yes  yes  l've always been in a hurry   you have to do a lot  so something has a chance of working   at the moment  as well as writing most of the magazine   l'm working on a movie scenario about king arthur   an edgar wallace thriller for the theatre   l'm trying to get farquhar and tonk turned into a cartoon for the cinema   or else a series on the wireless   and l want to make music express the  top selling music magazine in the country   l want to beat melody maker   that's not enough  stanley   that's not enough   you're right   it isn't  and  of course  l'm going  to make you the number one band in britain   l'm very ambitious  louis  so should you be     you think l'm not    l don't know yet   maybe  underneath that calm exterior of  yours  you're more ambitious than you seem   l want to reach a really big audience  of course   but l think some things are meant to take time   mm  speaking of which       wesley your permanent manager    why     just wondered    yes   definitely   he argues a lot  l know  but he's very effective     what are you doing    l just met a friend   joe's out tonight  so we will not be interrupted     lt's perfect    lt's against the rules   l think you'll find not too many people keep to those rules  carla   don't worry  just remember who got you here   ah  those musicians at the lmperial hotel   a four month booking now   we just need to check if that includes all of them   l feel we need proof of that     l never make mistakes  harry  as you know     no  sir  you do not   very occasionally  l take risks  and they pay off   they do  sir  very much so   but maybe l've made a bad mistake with this louis lester band   their kind of music is  as we know  not to everyone's taste   not to everybody's taste  no  sir  this is true   business is still picking up  is it   ln the main dining room  yes  sir  at the moment   have there been any serious complaints   there have been a number of complaints  of course   not always from where one might expect   what's this about  harry   there you are  l thought you might not come     why did you think that     cos l invited you completely out of the blue   well  l heard there were some good photos of me here   we don't actually know that yet   how good the photographs are     what do you mean    because l haven't developed them   l thought you'd like to see it happen   yes  l've never seen this before     never    no   ln fact  l've not had many photographs taken of me at all  maybe once before   well  that will soon change  l expect   you sound like stanley   well  stanley's a bit of a rogue  but he's not always wrong   your father doesn't mind you having these chemicals in the house   no  he quite likes the idea of his daughter being artistic   he's russian   remember     who's this    oh  it's lady cremone   she's an interesting lady  but she's a recluse   she has an apartment at the lmperial  but she never ever uses it   what do you think   l like it   he really is spooky  isn't he   yes  he is   sarah   sarah  are you there  sarah   hello  daddy  l was just showing mr lester my photographs in the dark room     louis  this is my father    delighted to meet you  sir   mr lester is the band leader l was talking to you about   good afternoon  l had no idea you had a guest  sarah   no idea at all   lf l'd known  l would have hurried home an hour earlier    wind blows round the steeple   empty world and sleepy people   l always     l always     carla  come on  we rehearsed this for two hours   hang on  one second  wesley   yes   yes  everything seems in the right place   not bad at all  stanley   give enough space to the west end shows  and you can't go wrong   don't work too late tonight  will you   and are you working late tonight   not tonight  rosie  l don't think l am   have to be elsewhere   lots happening   l'm sure there is  stanley  yes   lt's a bloody sight better than ''not bad''     julian     hello  dear friend  sorry to interrupt so rudely   but do you know what that is     dunno  what is it    go on  have a guess   a little shovel for somebody's town garden   couldn't be more wrong   l am now a master mason  l've been lifted to a new category     well  congratulations  julian    thank you  my dear friend     l didn't know you were a mason    l'm going to the temples tonight   in the sub basement of the lmperial  just as l told you   and l was wondering  knowing how you're interested in so many things  stanley   if you'd like to come along and watch me go in  in my full regalia   l can't  can l  l thought it was highly secret   don't worry  l know you read my magazine  from cover to cover  no need to be bashful   l won't be reading it much longer   it gets worse   your presence has been requested in the sub basement   l'm told it's a once in a lifetime opportunity   what do you think   you look tremendous  julian   you're not meant to be seen in those  are you   no  l'm not  only by fellow masons   l've just popped out of the special robing room   we'll see if l get fined or something worse   now  follow me   come on     where are we going  julian     shhh  promise me you won't write about this     ooh  l never promise that    promise   and you  louis   you won't tell anybody   whatever it is  l'll take it to my grave  l swear   l'm trying to remember where it is   a ha   there it is   come and have a look at this   very few people get to see this ever   lt was made as a dare  a few years ago  and  people have just forgotten that it's here   that is wonderful   there's dukes in there  see if you can see the duke of bedford   or the head of the foreign office   there's no members of the royal family today   now l'm late  l should be in there   and   remember   don't breathe a word to anyone  otherwise  we're all for it   that's the best time l've ever had in a linen cupboard   lf l succeed in making this place really fashionable   they may decide they have to move on  find a more sleepy hotel   you're going to flush out the masons  are you  stanley   mr schlesinger wants to see you  mr lester     what about    not you  stanley  l said mr lester   l have received a message from the immigration  authorities that they require a letter from me   stating that mr wesley holt is essential to your performances as a band     l will not write that letter    then l'll have to write it   you can write as many letters as you like  mr lester   but unfortunately  it is from me that they wish to hear   and l know that mr holt's presence is not  necessary for the success of the band   his presence is absolutely necessary   he's our manager   without him the band could break up     you don't believe that    l do   l intend to inform the authorities that  in my view   mr holt is an undesirable  destructive personality   who is utterly superfluous to the entertainment operation of this hotel   that is not true   mr holt has stolen food on more than five occasions   food  that's ridiculous  what food has he stolen   various cakes and other desserts   he has brought female companions back to his room   and no musician here has done that before   you can look me in the eye and tell me that  can you   you wanted accommodation in this hotel   l gave you that accommodation  and now your manager behaves like this   are you telling me that you are happy with that  mr lester     l will inform wesley of these allegations     allegations  he was seen by members of staff   and l will tell the band there is an attempt  to prevent mr holt from working with us   and in the event of that happening  we may  be forced to move on to another hotel   l met harold voight from the cecil the other day   he couldn't believe  could absolutely not believe   that l had coloured musicians staying in this hotel   just down the road at the savoy theatre   people are walking out of othello even as we speak   because the coloured actor   what's his name   robeson    is kissing his desdemona   and yet l give you four months' work in this hotel   people are amazed at what l've done   l wouldn't be so sure about getting another booking  mr lester   well  l am sure of one thing   lf mr holt is prevented from being here with us   there is no possibility of us carrying on without him   lsn't there     wesley    l been looking for you  where you been     l had to see schlesinger    oh  yes  he told me that   gentlemen  this passage is for management only   l want to know what's going on  louis   the authorities want a letter saying you're needed here  but you've behaved like an idiot  he won't write it     l've been doing what    how can you be so stupid   stealing food  bringing women back   ls that what he told you l'd done   right  l'm going to go and speak to him right now   wesley   how dare he talk to you rather than me   l'm the manager of this band   lf it's about me  you talk to me  nobody else   wesley  just calm down  for christ's sake   stop him  we'll find a room to do this     they don't think l'm necessary    nobody's saying that  l told him that     l don't believe you  you're lying    wesley   you'd be finished without me   whose going to fight for you now  who got you the contract  the rooms     lt was you    everybody knows what you do   you think he's going to do it  let me tell you about these people    him  mr donaldson and the rest   he'll drop you in a couple of weeks  move on to somebody else     l know that    no  you don't know  louis   you think he's going to make you famous  make you a star   put you on the front cover of his magazine   and you think l'm the idiot here  you know     that's why l told schlesinger you had to stay  that's why   he can't stop me from working with you   l helped build this band   lt's as much my work as yours  schlesinger     not in the lobby    schlesinger     wesley  please    where the hell is mr schlesinger     lf you'd got your birth certificate      and when have l had time to do that   when have l been able to do that  l've been working for you   come on   when  night after night l have been working for you   go now and get it  for christ's sake   go to wales  get the authorities to look up the records   ls this what it's about  a fucking birth certificate   one fucking birth certificate  one fucking piece of paper   don't do this in here  shut your mouth   so  what if l can't find it  what if there is no record  what then   they're going to send me back to the us   nobody's talking about that   oh  yes  they are  that is what they want to do   they'll arrest me as soon as l get off the boat     calm down    that wouldn't happen   do you realise what they'll do to me   they will try me  they'll probably execute me     they will send me to the chair  they will     wesley     and all because l stole a piece of cake   ls that what schlesinger wants  all because of a fucking piece of cake   l will never go back  do you understand   l cannot go back   gentlemen   and ladies  of course   l thought l should inform you that mr holt is now in custody     he's in prison    he's being detained  at the alien registration office   where the authorities are showing a keen interest in him   l'll go down there first thing tomorrow   glad to meet you  gentlemen  at long last   and ladies too  obviously   mr lester  could you step out here for a moment   l asked just mr lester to come out here  stanley   so you did  now  what have you got to tell us     l have received a message    from the alien registration office   not exactly  not unless they're now running  their operations from buckingham palace   l've received a message that  next friday   his royal highness the prince of wales  will be coming to dine here  for the first time   with the express purpose of listening to the louis lester band   his brother must have liked you   l do hope you will be here  mr lester  to entertain your future king   brought me a present  have you   l've brought you several presents  from me and the boys   cigars  and of course some cakes and eclairs   l hope you stole those from the kitchen   we're going to find that birth certificate in cardiff   mr donaldson is involved now  and he has contacts at the home office   good  that's good   l know what you're thinking   if l was so afraid about going back   why didn't l find it before   l did mean to find it   lt does exist  you know  you've got to believe me   l do believe you   mr holt is a british citizen   he has a birth certificate  which is lost   but there must be a record of it  we're going to produce it   produce it by next friday  by nine o'clock in the  evening  and naturally he will not be deported   lf he is a citizen  he has every right to stay here  of course     and if it takes longer    lt can't take longer   the deadline cannot be extended  nor is there any other process of appeal   l won't discuss this matter in front of the press   l'm not here as a member of the press   l'm here as the person who discovered the band   l think maybe it would be best if l deal with this  stanley   l'll get old nathan to drop the charges against wesley   and l am in touch with the authorities in wales   they'll be making a telephone call very shortly to the immigration authorities   don't worry  everything's in hand   are we ready  stanley   l think we're ready  nathan   you know what they say about the prince   what he likes today  the whole of london likes tomorrow   well  that was the plan  wasn't it  somehow to get him here   lf it misfires  if he doesn't like them   if he walks out  well  half the diners will leave as well  of course   joe  have you seen louis   has anybody seen louis  go and have a look  would you   musicians   pamela  what are you doing back here     l was looking for you    for me  why     l came to warn you    warn me   the prince may not come   just be prepared   he always accepts five invitations for every night   he may even get here  change his mind and leave  without even getting to the dining room   right   l will be doing my best to stop that from happening  of course   stanley  l want this to go well for you   so do l  l forced mr schlesinger to follow this plan   l know   l've been thinking about the picnic   a lot  more than l thought l would   l'll take that as a compliment   lt was a compliment  wasn't it   l believe it was   there you are   just getting ready  checking the order   l came to wish you good luck  but l know you don't need it   dear god  ln a
