 judas   my client's life is at stake     guilty    no   no  no   are you the monster     i must be a ruffian to get at the truth   the court is yours not garrow's   you are not sentenced yet   are you aware of the role this trial will play in our nation's history     he was slain by them    you may have trained me but you do not own me   blast your eyes  you damned bitch   mr garrow   these are the men who will decide what charge you face   your law is weak if men can bend it to their will   damn the lot of you  this is a lynching  not a trial   next prisoner   eliza radnell  spinster was indicted for that she on the 26th of april     oh  please take pity  sirs  tis my wife     house of thomas langstaffe did breach and enter   no person being therein and stealing  thence one linen shift   one pair of worsted stockings  twelve pence   i call the prosecutrix  mrs mary langstaffe   would that the jury concentrate as much as you   then this would be a much improved place     as for your place  it is not here alas    just one more case   you are not employed here   will   i came home and found her within   i asked her how she got in  she could not tell   i asked her what business she had with my things  she could not tell   i got assistance and kept her there until the parish beadle came over   mr crompton will not be pleased   it is drudgery there   i was not called to the bar to be buried in book dust   the prisoner shall speak for herself in her own defence   and again and as ever  no defence counsel for the prisoner   i beg your pardon  sir  but i had drunk part of four pints of two penny   i let myself in the house to sleep  i put the clothes on for warmth       no    it did not take them long to confer   the sentence is branding   no   relative to transportation  it is a mercy   but she may have been telling the truth  that she was not guilty   the wisdom of the court observes that it requires no manner of skill to make a plain and honest defence   but it will  one day it will     an acquittal shall follow   will  when you have a criminal brief  it will be your duty to address a court of law   but not now   nicholas porter is indicted for stealing two fat hogs  value 40 shillings  and 18 live fowls value nine shillings     mr southouse   you have business in there this afternoon   a silk merchant prosecuted by a creditor with half a guinea to enlist me as his attorney   is he in need of counsel  i should very much like to help   you who  should hurry   mr garrow   mr crompton   brandy here  this man's not been long robbed at gunpoint   come on  come and sit down   the wretch clapped a pistol to my breast and demanded my money   whoa   you robbed this gentleman  you wretch  and now you'll be brought to justice   mr southouse  i've never been inside newgate  i would learn from it   i'm not there to furnish you with experience   well  what then   a very faithful and sincere young woman  has sold half her possessions to pay for my service on behalf of her brother   it is a very limited service  you cannot appear in court   you may tell him who and what is sworn against him and help prepare his speech       and it may save his life    it may   mr southouse  i promise i will not speak  i will merely observe   i have seen you observe at the old bailey   your eyes are very busy as is your mouth  unfortunately   i cannot stay in the pleader's office   then head for quarter sessions   pass paupers from one parish to another  oppose dancing licences     i will be an old bailey barrister  and i will seek any attorney for my briefs  but i would rather you embraced me  dear mentor   very well     but in silence   mr southouse  always a pleasure to see you going about your business   my er     his humble servant   peter pace  please   this way  gentlemen   so  the young lady's brother was brought before the justice for violent theft and highway robbery   half a guinea is a not inconsiderable sum     but for his life  it may be a bargain   thank you   peter  this is mr southouse  your attorney   i never saw my accusers at all until they come up to me and knocked me off my horse   they stamped on my head  they said they would butcher me for what i done  they said   damn his eyes  kill him    my pen is not yet out of my pocket  mr pace   please     now then  tell me  at magistrate's court  what passed   i cannot exactly recall   my mind was not set right   mr grove  the prosecutor swore he was the highwayman   the charge says that two shillings were stolen   they did not find me two shillings richer     you were searched immediately    i was more set upon       and then brought along    you were in want of money     sir    will   did you see an opportunity     a man  alone on a deserted road    you will wait outside   the man you overtook   put a pistol to his cheek and then discarded it     never    explain this  who is this accuser   mr garrow  apprentice to me at 15     but too gifted in law to be a mere attorney   come  sir  you can speak freely  black is white and white is black   according as we are paid  our loyalty is to the client  not to the truth     william    speak freely   oh  i have a language for you  sir   damn you both if you would take a guinea from me or my sister and think to have me lie   i will not have you   good   excellent  well said   you will not give a better testimony   oh  oh  i see     you do    he puts it to me and i     excellent  sir   and am i blessed to have the both of you to serve me   ah    not     mr garrow is a barrister   i would be bound to instruct him   then do so   mary   but the cost of a barrister  madam   half a guinea     i'm afraid that will not      half a guinea   half a guinea   you are instructed     i am instructed    attorney and counsel     this goes well    this goes very well   mr garrow   mr crompton   will    william   you will concentrate here     this is the brief    it is     it's very thin    well  you're not allowed to see the indictment   you are refused copies of the deposition sworn against your client   you are not permitted to visit your client while he is in newgate   when you are at the old bailey  you will not be allowed to address the jury  make an opening statement  or a closing speech   you may call witnesses as to the prisoner's character but they are not bound to appear   in fact  not only is it impermissible for counsel to make a full defence   it is barely allowable for them to actually win a case   hence the thinness of your papers   but in the meantime  mr southouse  what have i to save mr pace from the rope   the prosecution's testimony   you must find a weakness in it   study your brief  i shall see you at court   goodnight  will   and if you cannot sleep  let us hope it's from anticipation and not fear   good night   william   you look splendid   oh  no   edward forrester  a renowned thief taker   if he's involved in the prosecution  this goes not so well     mr southouse  if a thief taker is at the heart of this that will help make our defence    or our damnation   good luck  will   mary   who's this     william garrow from lincoln's inn    by way of     sir    well  not oxford or i'd know you   articled to an attorney  john southouse of milk street   you received your education in billingsgate   oh  dear     silvester   middle temple   come to condemn the wretches or confound the jury today   i've come to defend a man     it's first case    peter pace   you're against me  and the facts   court shall rise   still  they'd need only detain for us for a few hours  then what's next   oh  a coining  well  that will be two hangings before lunch     i recommend the broth    i recommend you read your brief again   the prisoner  peter pace  is indicted for that he   in the king's highway in and upon william grove  feloniously  did make an assault  putting him in corporeal fear and danger of his life and stealing from his person  two shillings in monies numbered the property of the said william grove   call william grove   so  the alarm being raised  we gave chase   mr forrester  myself and mr stoddert who'd witnessed the assault upon me   mr grove  at the magistrate's committal you swore to the identity of the fellow   could you please do so now again for the benefit of this court     you lie    behold the prisoner   a humour not to be encountered on any lonely by way   no more questions   you know this man   i know this is the man that robbed me   you swore before the magistrate   that the man who robbed you covered his face with a handkerchief   yes   yes   so how were you able to swear to mr pace   this man rode a grey mare   is there a horse in the dock  mr grove   sir   a grey mare accused of robbery   i do not know what you mean  sir   well  your only means of identification is by way of the horse my client was riding   you could not swear to his face  could you  you could only swear to his horse   what words did your attacker make use of   he demanded my money or my life     those were the very words  your money or your life    well  he expressed it in that manner   he came up  shows me the pistol and he says     your money or your life  remarkable     you were robbed of two shillings    i was   oh  dear  still  40 is better than two shillings     well  i don't know that it is under a wrong cause    a wrong cause   you know it is not every day that one gets  40 reward for hanging a man  is that not your cause   m'lord  my learned friend mr garrow has a very rude approach   mr garrow     do not speculate   interrogate  and do so with a little delicacy   hear  hear   who paid for this prosecution     mr forrester    mr forrester  the renowned thief taker   yes  sir   and who paid for your expenses to attend this business     mr forrester    what assistance that man does provide   no further questions  my lord   thank you  mr grove   do you think mr garrow makes an impression on the jury   forrester appears next and he has made an impression on many juries   call edward forester   a robbery takes place on the road  from hounslow to hanworth  where a thief taker is dining at that very hour   a rare convenience   the good fortune of those in need   you had no fear to pursue a man who would wield a pistol   i had a pistol of my own  sir   who paid for this prosecution     i paid half a guinea    who paid for the indictment    i did   to see justice done   to obtain the conviction of a guilty man who would put others in fear and danger of their life     you are quoting the indictment    it is also my belief     as a thief taker    and as a man   but as the former  you are a taker of rewards for the apprehension  and conviction of those found guilty of serious crimes   as the government sees fit   and are you hoping for a reward here   i would not presume on the judge  the jury or the law   i put it to you that this crime did not take place   a man was caught  brought before the magistrate and stands here now   i put it to you that you paid grove to make a hue and cry against an innocent man     turn him all at once into a highwayman    innocence is the jury's business   i put it to you that you invented this robbery   i put it to you that     the victim and the witness are schemes of your own fiction  as is the blameless prisoner you accuse as your robber     mr garrow  it is your job to excite distrust of the evidence not to make a speech on your client's behalf   please forgive my learned friend  m'lord   until today he's never actually been in the law     how long have you been in the honorable business of thief taking   um    i can't rightly tell   well  guess a little  how long   well  clearly some time longer than you've been a counsellor     how many     sir     how many trials did you appear upon last sessions    never a one   what  there was no blood money in the last sessions   if there were no thieves  how would you get a brief   unless this be your last     no more questions   thank you  mr forrester   gentlemen  you will consider your verdict   you may wish to leave this place   i cannot until i know my brother's fate   you have reached a verdict     unanimously    how do you find the prisoner   guilty   no   no   no  please  god have mercy   judge  your lord  i beseech you   the sentence is death   death by hanging   take the prisoner down   no  no     it troubles you not to derive your living from the groans of the gallows   mr garrow   the man is all a flutter  my lord   i should demand satisfaction if i had not already found it in the verdict     you will apologise to mr silvester    i will only apologise to my client     then i shall commit you    so your lordship may   mr garrow  you are hot headed and intemperate   this is your first case here and you have lost it   so  i forgive you   now sit down   next prisoner   may i     eat    broth   you need food  man   that  and a stronger constitution   it is the lot of defence counsel to see their clients carried off to tyburn   i was determined mainly to prosecute  far more congenial   and as for the rights of prisoners  that's a very irregular income     you will learn that the law is not a game for gentlemen    will i   and you'll learn to become a gentleman or there shall be no law for you at all   mr garrow   sir arthur hill mp invites you to dinner   now you have an opportunity  garrow   are you familiar with the phenomenon of cutlery   i have made law and order my business in parliament  mr garrow   but i fear i understand the law only as we legislate  and not as it is practised   even an mp should not be quite so narrow   so you do attend the old bailey  sir arthur   i am fortunate to have the attendance of my wife there     mr garrow  we are grateful that you did accept our invitation    lady sarah   well  i imagine those that see me at the bench would consider me there for my leisure and sport  and judge buller certainly does think me very elegant alongside him   and how could you not look so  beside him   i'm not there for his decoration   but on my behalf  so that i'm informed from the very place where justice is dealt   the law be dealt there  but no justice   you will enlighten us   i am sorry if you feel a source of enquiry for a good dinner but  i think at least you should have your dinner before you feel so used   the law is the concern of us all here   we are under siege in london from ruffianism   from chick lane to the ratcliffe highway   we all do well to employ our own watchmen   and form our own societies   you have heard of the society for the reformation of manners  mr garrow   you campaign  mrs browning   we bring prosecutions in the hope that it will be    improving   improving manners in illegitimacy  adultery  bawdy houses  molly houses  prostitution     what's a molly house    and what do you know of such   i pay attention at the old bailey as you would have me do is all   pay attention to      sodomy  mr sowerby  sodomy and catamites   please sir  you may examine me   my wife did remark that your     defence of the prisoner was very     singular   it was why we did invite you here   you do not favour the protection of our society in prosecution   the bloody code upheld   the terror of the rope  the branding iron   the thief takers' corruption that sends innocent men to tyburn   and you think a battle amongst counsel the best way of arriving at the truth   the prisoner in the dock has been too long left to his fate for want of counsel   and is your loyalty to the prisoner     or your fee    my loyalty is to the truth   but you'll settle for finding a  not guilty  regardless of the truth   and you think we should eke out injustice all day long for one wrong verdict that may come between   i will not believe that the law is a lie   and i think i may be     better minded to listen to talk of reform were it not so bound up with the burgeoning prospects of defence counsel   now there's a truth for you    did not the felon firmly fix his hope on flaw or jaw and so escape the rope     justly he'd meet that fate without reprieve that comes when the advocate fails to deceive    a good satire  sir   it seems your investigations into the law were concluded before they had begun   if i am not a source of satire for a good dinner  i will also not be a source of amusement for it   i remember my father teaching in the school where my education was under his superintendence   we were both mocked    him by his better born pupils for the plainness of his background  and myself for the fact that no fee was paid for my education   my father's service was the fee   he suffered their insults behind his back  he never turned to face them down   and you were taken out   because i would bite and scratch   they were for oxford  i was articled   and i was grateful for it   and now   my dear friend  i thank you for your trust  but you should not have instructed me with the case   well  now you are instructed at least     but i was undone by my arrogance  my inexperience    you lack manners   you were too angry   you lost control   and what did you mean to challenge judge buller   you are in the law  you cannot be in contempt of it   the law is itself is contemptible   then perhaps you are not ready to practise it   your new chambers are very commodious   if i still have use for them   it is a vile day at the old bailey when we are in want of eleventh hour briefs from attorneys   a state of affairs you may well have to get used to permanently unless you begin to win   more than agreeable   mr silvester   a murder   and all prosecution witnesses already called before the coroner   lunch will come early   will  it was a prosecution brief   you could not trust me with such a case   i think    i think things came a little too quickly    here and there in the crowd we mark with pity     for his too certain fate     the careworn face of some self educated peasant     the ambition which has aspired his toil in the unwonted field of legal labour    is doomed to inevitable blight    so  mrs tarling  the prisoner elizabeth jarvis  came into your service as a servant some three weeks since   yes  your honour  after a few days i suspected she was with child   she insisted she was not   if the magistrate thinks the case strong enough to go to trial   the society will bring a prosecution upon this wretch      and found blood on the kitchen table and on the floor   i took a candle and followed the spots of blood  into the coal cellar    sorry   pray continue  mrs tarling   i hope you will not find this too distressing   i am not concerned about myself   who will defend her   she may ask god's mercy   a pair of stockings soaked in blood and     as i moved a box    the body of a dead child   her name is elizabeth jarvis   she is committed for trial  infanticide     and you will pay for counsel    i will pay for mr garrow   mr garrow   no other       will    mr southouse   you have a brief for me and i am like a dog called to its bowl  thank you     a tankard of ale  please    of course   how has a maidservant a guinea for her defence   a lady has a guinea and an inclination to help her   and you have an inclination to help me   we have to prove that the child was born dead   otherwise the mother be presumed guilty of its murder   the presumption of innocence  of course  not applying in infanticide   particularly when she is unmarried   particularly when the birth was concealed   regarded as usually conclusive evidence of the woman's guilt   and the evidence that would be in her favour   did she confess the pregnancy   did she seek assistance in labour   did she prepare for birth by the collection of linen   and the answer to all three be  no    and there is the presence of a bloody knife  and a surgeon attesting to marks of violence   mr southouse  this is an unwinnable case   previously you were a barrister with too much confidence   now you are one with none   all right  i will earn my guinea  but who has pledged it   who has better faith than i that we can obtain an acquittal here   her name is lady sarah hill  and she attended the magistrate's committal for her education     lady sarah hill instructed you    and most expressly asked for you   mrs browning did almost drop her spoon when you left the room   well  at least she will not try to enlist me for her society   you could not join the reformation of manners because you have none   i refuse to be reformed  and your husband     he did not object    because he thinks i fled the argument   his beliefs are sincere and certain   but you do not share them   on this particular cause  no   my husband sat on a parliamentary committee  with the aim of reforming the law on infanticide   it was suggested that a lesser charge    concealment    be instigated in its place   your husband was an opponent to change   concealment carries a two year sentence   he was still of the opinion that women who bring forth bastards should be hung     you have read on the subject    secretly   from the papers that lay in my husband's study   mrs browning is convinced that in elizabeth jarvis  they will punish sexual licentiousness and loose morals   i only saw a young woman trapped and overwhelmed with fear   but you are not afraid yourself  i think   my husband would consider my participation in this an infidelity   well  it shall remain a confidence we share   but in defence  and in this case above all  i am disadvantaged in law   then you shall have all the evidence i noted in the magistrate's parlour   i believe i am fortunate to have made your acquaintance   and fortune may allow us to prevail     to newgate  but it's not permissible    why     it's not etiquette    you would prefer taste to justice   i must know more than in the brief allowed  i must see the prisoner   i am the attorney  i talk to the client  i make the preparation   you do not trust my services all of a sudden   i do not trust myself  mr southouse   it is not a wish to flout conventions   it is simply thoroughness to ensure that all ground is covered in this case   and that i am truly prepared  where before i was not     well  if it comes from humility  then happily    good  excellent   lady sarah will meet us there   lady sarah  how so   elizabeth    you lied about not being pregnant   you then attempted to conceal the birth   explain to me as counsel for the prosecution would have you do   the knowledge of my pregnancy would bring about my dismissal  sir   and i would have left that residence with no character reference  and little chance i'd be taken into service again   and i did not want to own my shame   you prepared no linen   i had not the wits or the wherewithal to plan anything   you had the wherewithal for a knife  elizabeth   you had the wits to know that you would cut the navel string   that's no modesty  that was cold experience     well    i knew i had to separate the child from me   bodily  yes  and in life  at first  did you want this child dead  so you could live   the child was already dead  sir  but if it had lived     would you have killed it  would you   look at me    i would have hid it  in the hope that it would be found alive and well and looked after   and never have to follow in the low ways of its mother   gaoler   you would go there for thoroughness   you simply convinced her of her own worthlessness   and convinced myself of her innocence   you think to play rough tricks to prepare your defence   i am in want of rough tricks  i am learning some     her innocence may be established in court  not in newgate    maybe   by casting polite doubt on the eyesight of the prosecutrix   or the obtaining of an acquaintance of elizabeth as character witness  that will not suffice     you cannot insult your way to an acquittal  it was your mistake before    that i was not rude enough was my mistake   i have no other means but to destroy the prosecutrix  and make war with her counsel  what would you have me say after the trial    i am in no way satisfied the jury were right in finding the prisoner guilty    but at least everything was carried out with the utmost decorum    the life of elizabeth jarvis is at stake  in solemn and polished injustice  i must be a ruffian to get at the truth   i must confront the gentlemen of the old bailey to save her life   lady sarah   i am sorry you were in attendance  but     nonsense   i am gratified to hear it   well     well  then  if you are going to insult   your tongue must at least be well prepared with the sharpest of facts   which it is my job  as attorney  as your attorney     as a fact  i've already arranged an appointment   oh  where   we are to meet a surgeon     and these   well  these are the forceps   and these     to cut the navel string  in certain circumstances    such as   when it's around the baby's throat   now  you wish to see the mortuary   in particular  the lungs of infants recently dead   certainly  there are new cadavers there now   by preparation i meant black letter law and statutes  not this atrocity   elizabeth jarvis was indicted for that she  on the 29th april last   at the parish of marylebone  being big with a certain female child   the said female child  alone and secretly from her body  by the providence of god  did bring forth alive   which said child  being so born alive     everybody does look at me  where do i look   fix your eyes on me  in hope you see your acquittal      but being moved and seduced by the instigation of the devil  feloniously and wilfully and of her malice aforethought     you listen for some mistake in the indictment to get the case thrown out   a forlorn hope  but at least you are learning your law   mr garrow   improvement will surely follow   if not quite enough for acquittal of this careless spinster   mrs tarling  could you tell me what happened that morning   i went to the prisoner's room with my niece   i found the prisoner in bed   and you found her  apart from horizontal     sir     her manner    she said she felt better   she felt better   the baby was downstairs dead  and she felt better   by this  presumably  you mean she felt relieved and glad     i mean she      sanguine and very calm       m'lord  may the witness not be the subject of mr  sylvester's ventriloquism    i put no words into the mouth of the witness     you lead her like a farmer that brings a cow to market    m'lord  my friend speaks with the experience of his former calling     the cow very sickly  the farmer selling it hasty    mr garrow     continue  mr silvester    my lord   you addressed her in her room     as she lay there     feeling better   yes  sir   and what did you say to her   i told her it was a very sad thing  and       how could she do so cruel an act    and her reply    do what  mrs tarling    she said   she would not own it   i spoke more plain  and i asked her how she could destroy the poor little creature   and she responded   she made no answer   she made no answer   i have no more questions  my lord   mrs tarling     do you remember the account of this you gave to the magistrate    i do   do you remember that you swore it   i do   i've just heard you tell my learned friend the prisoner gave you no answer     is that the end of what passed between you    i cannot recall   you say you asked her how she could destroy the poor creature and she gave you no answer   i put it to you that you then asked her why she did so     that may be so    please  try to recall what you have already sworn to   i think i asked her if     if she destroyed it to prevent its crying   you asked her if she destroyed it to prevent its crying  yes or no     yes  i did  sir    and how did the prisoner respond     i cannot recall    please try    i cannot   that this young woman may be executed in consequence of your evidence  would you not venture to recall      my lord  this is very rough    why do you tremble so     this is an onerous occasion    yes  my client's life is at stake   now would you please recall what you swore in front of the magistrate   or is the truth now too inconvenient to own     no    good   please look at the jury as you do so   very well   she said     it did not cry   it never cried   it did not cry   it never cried   it had no breath to cry   it was still and silent and unmoving   it was dead when it was born     court shall adjourn for lunch    court shall rise   my lord  i have not finished cross examining the witness   it is my court  mr garrow  and i shall determine the fate of my lamb chops  as ruthlessly as i determine the law here   sometimes a mouth must simply allow chewing as its function   the prisoner used to speak to clear himself or hang himself   now the prisoner is silent  we have the eloquent hectoring of mr garrow     in a cause not his own    judge  it may not be his cause  but surely the defence of the accused is progress and therefore some improvement   improvement  madam  how can it be improvement in my own court  where i play a lesser part   am i merely there to temper mr garrow's reign of terror   i shall have to put out my leg to trip up the coming of these lawyers  or i will be trampled underfoot     doctor  after you made examination of the child   would your opinion be that it was alive or dead at the time the wound to the throat was inflicted   oh  alive   in wounds made on a living subject  the edges are always red  and diverted  or turned out   and there are little spots of coagulated blood from the extremities of the blood vessels   now that would be caused by the coagulation of blood just before death     did you open the body of the child    i did   it was the body of a full grown  mature  healthy child   the lungs were fully inflated which would not have been the case  had not the child breathed for some little time   in other words  the child had been alive when it was cut with the knife   that is so   poor little wretch       circulation continues after death  does it not    yes   so those appearances that you spoke of could equally occur after death   i should say not  unless    a very few minutes after death possibly   but my experience has not been such   and i understand the test to which you subjected the lungs is called the hydrostatic test       yes     and you have read beck and taylor's work on medical jurisprudence    they are high authorities on that subject   indeed they are  well  you will tell me of professor taylor    the hydrostatic test is no more capable of showing that a child has been born alive   than it is of proving whether it has been murdered or died of natural causes    in other words  the exercise is worthless is it not   my own experience tells me     then the highest authority on this subject is incorrect   well  i have never before engaged professionally on an inquiry of this nature   oh  really  then you are some kind of beginner  your own experience doesn't mean very much    mr garrow   if you have the work of professor taylor alongside you   may i suggest you read out the relevant excerpt in court   yes  your honour   who is this man  is this man an attorney   junior counsel  my lord    the majority of those who have made experiments upon this subject have only pretended to show    by the use of this and other tests  whether or not a child has breathed    is that you  sir  conducting unreliable experiments   pronouncing solemnly on scientific advancements that actually advance nothing   the child breathed with some force  it was a vital act   and how would it have breathed with a cord around its neck   enough for the lungs to inflate   dear me  sir  how your lungs inflate       do you recognise these  mr herring    yes   they're used in some deliveries   they are used  are they're not  in cases where the navel string   the umbilical cord  is twisted around the neck of the child     i believe so    you believe so   i have not used them   i believe the process of cutting the cord in such circumstances is considered so hazardous  that this peculiar pair of scissors is manufactured for the purpose  is it not   to prevent  by accident  an incision in the throat of a child   mr garrow       i have never cut the cord from a child's neck    from design   i have never had the experience of such an event   really  oh  dear  oh  dear   precisely how many children have you delivered       several     a dozen or      well  one or the other  mr herring   it is not my specialism   poor fellow  you are without the necessary competence once again     my lord  this is bullying    curb your tongue  mr garrow   yes  your honour   despite your lack of expertise   you do acknowledge that cutting the cord from a child's neck may cause an incision there   it's a possibility   very well   can you not say     that a female in such circumstances as unassisted labour  may from pain and anxiety   become deprived of all judgment   cause an incision by accident in the throat of a child   a child who was fatally compromised by the cord around its neck     and therefore dead  and from whom this poor mother was naturally anxious to remove herself   my lord  my learned friend is addressing the jury   my lord  i'm merely looking their way   you may not address them with your mouth or your eyes     i know the limitations of my defence    as do i   perhaps you would like the witness to provide an answer to your    speech     it is my fervent wish    then put it to him more succinctly   i put it to you  mr herring   that the wound to the child's throat was not a mark of violence at all  but a sad sign of desperation   she cut her offspring's neck because she did not know what she was doing   it may be so   court will adjourn for a short time   court shall rise   i was earlier detained by some doubtful lamb chops and i fear they may detain me again     you think it goes well  mr southouse    i think we head towards acquittal     the judge is determined that you shall lose    how so   in the way that he will direct the jury   what can be done  mr southouse   if he is determined  there is nothing to be done   will   court shall rise   i cannot address the jury directly so the court must hear your voice     what do i say    how you did defend yourself to me in newgate   remember how you were in newgate     mr silvester    my lord   do you wish to call any more witnesses     none  my lord     mr garrow  any witnesses as to the defendant's character    none  my lord   very well   sir     if i may     i could not own to the pregnancy  because i could not bear it to be true   but i held       i held my child in the cellar  as its flesh grew colder and colder       until i grew cold next to her   i did not sleep that night   i did not wash her blood from me  i would not   it was also my blood   my baby did not suffer in life   my baby was born at peace   the single question here is whether the mother has proved that the infant was born dead   i draw your attention to grievous wounds at the child's throat   i draw your attention to the fact  the young woman had provided no things for the child   no clothing  no linen   it suggests that she was in no way prepared for the arrival of the child   had no intention of keeping it   to be sure  in this case there is evidence to convict of the crime of wilful murder   you will confer and reach a verdict       you have reached a verdict    we have   how do you find the prisoner charged with this indictment   guilty or not guilty   not guilty    the prisoner is free to go   you think i play the law as a game for gentlemen   you're not wrong   but now  sir  you will find me in earnest   mr garrow  you are also free to go   unless of course you intend to defend every prisoner here today   not today  my lord  but perhaps tomorrow   next prisoner   i owe you my life  mr garrow   it should not have been at stake  but you will thrive now   with a reference  i may have hope of some employment     mr southouse    gladly   thank you     thank you  both   thank god you did not disappoint me   and now perhaps by association with me  you will not be blackened further as a newgate solicitor   by association with you i may find some other trouble altogether   i shall change the trial forever   then you shall make enemies  mr garrow   i hope there shall be some who will favour me   oh    i cannot do what is not in my heart to do   you were called to the bar  they do not announce your heart there   that man is the monster  he is the monster that did attack me   you no longer find favour with the public gallery  mr garrow   i would happily lay my hands on you  rawlings   madam  your agitation seems to occur at the most convenient time     corrected by rubens
