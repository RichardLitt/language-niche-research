previously  it's nothing  just an old notebook   trivial ramblings of a medical student   i was happy in 1917   i was sent in the remote village of mur'ev to run a hospital   i just graduated  top of the class  so you're in safe hands   what seems to be the trouble here   he is young  but he really is a doctor   do i really used to look like that     give it back    no   come along  doctor  this is the dispensary     to the sweet shop    this is the key   don't lose it   it's just that the old doctor had a beard   leopold leopoldovic   feldsher  you do the chloroform   i will go and get my cigarettes   a young doctor's notebook   episode 2   moscow  1934   prescriptions   seriously  is that all you have   i am a doctor  i write a lot of prescriptions   what do you think  i just lay my hands on the sick   and that   a notebook   i just graduated   i was bored  stuck in the middle of nowhere   this is a waste of time  i have patients to see   anna  pelageya   come quickly   alright

no    no  stand up   sit down     you see  no more balance    impressive     yeah  are you constipated    well  if anything  i am a bit loose     no  and yet she drank an entire flask of belladonna drops   honest to god  i did  sir  it was me  sir  no one else  sir   well  you see   yes  i think i do   this woman drank an entire flask of belladonna drops   yet displays no signs of belladonna poisoning whatsoever   how do you explain that     are there two of them    you can't   it's unheard of  it is unprecedent   you could read every textbook in the imperial moscow university library   and never come across a case like this   and i know  because i've read every textbook in the moscow university library   i publish a paper     in the new journal of herbology   i could even lecture   and what  pray tell did you have for breakfast the morning after  the night you drank an entire flask of belladonna drops   stale bread   stale bread   but it would have mold on it  wouldn't it   fascinating   don't just stand there  feldscher     let go of me    what    what are you doing   i thought i told you to come and get me  when he does something stupid   you can't just take her like that  i was writing a paper     belladonna drops  is it    yes  how do you know   honest to god  sir  i took all the drops myself  no one else did   you're a liar   she's sold those drops in the rest of the village and come back for more   you might know how to fool the doctor  but not us  honestly   i'm not cross with you   you trust too easy  they can smell this weakness     i thought the beard would help    yes   a beard would help    what are you doing   nothing   can you believe it  she walked for half a day to get here   and then told lies just for a flask of belladonna drops   i know   it's not the first thing i'd steal   you're alright   i'm fine   tell me they're not all going to be like that   they can't be  can they   normal people must live out here  too   right  it's nothing like i expected   what did you expect  you're in the middle of nowhere   no  you took a train in the middle of nowhere   and it took you another day to get here   come on   it's not that bad   you've been lucky with the weather   a patient for you  doctor     can it wait    no   fine   is this going to take much longer   perfect   that's my coat   it looks much for the beard  don't you   do i   i just have a sore throat   you also a have a rash on your chest and a lesion on your genitals   all i want is a gargle   i think you'd better sit down   no  no  no  you can    can pull your trousers up first  please   thank you   this part of my job is never easy   i expect    i'm sure that as a soldier  there have been times when danger has     but  you've been in life full of     you faced danger   you know  a bullett or a mortal shell or a bayonet   but the fact is you face a kind of danger now  which is     well  it is no less dangerous   you see  you have a marmorial rash on the upper torso  a primary lesion  and papules in the esophagus   so in short     and i'll not skirt around the issue     i'm afraid you have contracted     syphilis   all i want is a gargle  for my sore throat  wi    did you hear me   i said you had syphilis   what's that then  it is an extremely serious and highly infections disease    without the immediate   and proper treatment     will i get the gargle     because my throat is killing me    no it is not   syphilis is killing you that is what i am trying to make you understand   it is extremely serious and highly infectious   eh    hygiene is going to very important now  vital   black ointment is very good  but you must rub it in thoroughly     are you out of gargle    forget the sore throat   if you don't do as i tell you your symptoms could become a lot worse   i'll come back and see the proper doctor   you are going to die   a slow and painful death    i mean horrific  ulcers  pus  your nervous system shot to pieces     you will long for the sweet release of death   believe me  you will look back fondly on the sore throat   your nose will fall off   stop wait  i need to give you the ointment   this is what i am talking about   i've got a sore throat and he wants to rub my legs     eh   ridiculous   have you got a wife   a family  because they need to come and see me at once   half a day here  half a day back   no gargle  he's ridiculous     no   but he just      doctor they don't understand  the nuances of syphilis like we do as men of science   i doubt that he knows what 'highly contagious' means   yeah  we're not in moscow now   we are  in fact 978 long versts north north east of moscow   yep  we are in the back of the back of the earth   what else could i have done   painting a more graphic picture   rectal sores wouldn't planch it   actually  you might want to get the chair a wipe  too   i     why wouldn't he listen to me   is it the half beard   you know it's unbearable to watch a patient walk out that door and know they're going  to die a slow and agonizing death   but you get used to it     how can you say that    it's true     he's one of hundreds   and it's only syphilis    that's terrible     it's an epidemic    i know     but what can you do    i'll open a ward   i'll write a compelling letter to the zemstvo     i ask for more staff    i have to fight this    save the world  one peasent at a time   yes   i like your optimism  it's adorable   i am a doctor  it is my duty to help these people   i believe duty calls   what are you looking for   nothing   i just noticed the drawer sticks   i must have fixed it   let me go   i need to see the doctor   i'm here  what is it   he's deranged   what have i done  tell me   nothing  nothing  it's going to be alright   help me  doctor  i give you money  food  anything   yes  but let us calm you down first   good   good   now i can get to the bottom of his psychological troubles   actually  i've got a five on my public exam for psychiatry   yes  this promises to be a most interesting case   she fell in the lathe   she's all i have   don't let her die   in the lathe   what do you suppose that could mean   right   an actual lathe   anna   where was all the blood   there was barely a drop left in her   i thought to myself     so this is what it looks like  to watch a girl     torn to shreds  slip into the next world   you know  i think i might just go back to my room     no need   since you got here  i like to keep a packet of those in the cupboard   in case of emergency   good idea   this  doesn't look good   you said she's their only child   his only child  he's a widower   he took me once to a harvest festival   he cried   excellent   don't look down     i told you not to look down    but if you say not to look down     obviously  i'm gonna look down    alright then  look down   ahh   is she alive   i'm sorry     but i'm afraid  she is     it's horrific    i've seen worse   but it is up there   she doesn't have a pulse   no  it's there   hardly   she is clinging to her life     there is absolutely nothing   i can do for her    don't let me hear you say that   so  what if you've never done anything like this before     don't forget  you have great grades    yes  i know  i know     but i don't think anyone can do anything for her     so you're saying  you just   want to let her die    no  no     how could you even      suggest such a thing   no  no  don't feel bad about it  i'm just surprised  that's all   normally  it takes a lot longer for a doctor to get like this   what   cinical    numb by human suffering     hats off to it    no  no  i'm not numb     eight year old girl  that's cold     i like it    you misunderstand me   no  i get it   you do want to save the world  one peasant at a time     yes    but just not this one   yes    i mean  no   because you don't want to do an amputation     yes    because it's foul    and hideous and barbaric     and the stench  it stays within your nostrils for days   i don't blame you     well  doctor    prepare for amputation   but  doctor  do you really want to torment her   she's going to die   you heard what i said  feldsher  sterilize the knives   anna  the tourniquet  pelageya  the morphine   okay  team  you heard what the doc said   let's get this show on road   here come the good times     you just said not to bother    he said  she said    who cares   you need to focus  you're strong     what did you have for breakfast    i don't remember   we'll soon find out   now  where the hell did she go with that morphine  gracevka   is she still alive   mind the     lamp   here we go   oh  right  you want to start on that leg   yes   as you were   you're sure she's not dead   i'm sure   right   yes  right   amputation saw     careful    it's alright  it's blunt     still alive    yeah   why don't you just die   right   ligatures   and the other leg   you know    i think we should leave it on  and you   she's    she's lost a lot of blood   seven years   finest university in all russia   all that hard work     to reach the top of the class   and for what   i'm not a doctor   i'm nothing but a butcher   and a seamstress   what am i doing here   why did they send me to this godforsaken backwoods   but you did a good job  she's alive   i know  but look at her   what's left of her   what have i done   you saved her   you just might have to settle for saving the world     three quarters of a peasant at a time   i can't do this for 2 years   i     i just want be able to cope   what are you doing     it's a bit left    a bit of morphine   you would've throw it away   you couldn't take it     is that a problem    yes   it is  put id down  you're a doctor   so i know what i'm doing   put it down   no  you can't make me     clamp    yes     and this is an amputation saw    no  don't   don't worry  it's blunt   you have no idea  what you're doing   you performed many amputations  doctor   no   not really   three     it looked like you first    well  it was     my     first leg     definitely    you come to the right place  you'll have     plenty of oppurtunities to improve   i bid you good night   in time     you will be the equal of a     young and inexperienced     leopold leopoldovic     and his is the name i do not mention lightly   thank you   i'm not a doctor   i'm a butcher   the ware of choiced cuts and the finest sausage meat   and to think i read all the medical textbooks  in the imperial moscow university library   what for   while the only book i really need  is 'practical tips for jointing a carcass'   'wherever possible  use a sharpened saw  '  'in case of tiredness  change arms  '  perhaps i could lecture     in abattoirs  this is useless   i'm probably going to have to operate   i'll just take the drops  you can't cut his eye   what eye  he doesn't have an eye  ha has a     well  a big yellow tumor or something     the drops will be fine    the drops can't grow an eye   he is a child  you can't just cut bits off   i'm not going to cut anything off  i'm going to gouge     no    yes   give me the infant   give him to me     don't be ridiculous    help   please  don't hurt him  i don't want you take out     what now   is that pus   as i thought   an abscess   i'll get you those drops   but the names     on the prescriptions  doctor   leopold leopoldovic  demyan lukich     pelageya ivanovna     what do they have in common    you obviously know the answer   they are all deceased   and have been since before the dates on these prescriptions   would you care to explain
