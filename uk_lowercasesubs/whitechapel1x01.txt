keep back   do not come any   closer   listen  you've been told once  i don't want to tell you again   we need bold initiatives in community partnerships  to ensure good practice within a management framework   this is about the effective delivery of sanctions to the stakeholders   the stakeholders  five years ago we called them criminals   excuse me  excuse me   night  see you tomorrow  night  mary   oh  my god   i've got you  love  you're going to be all right   pcso bousfield to control  receiving  over   receiving you  mary  go ahead   immediate assistant and an ambulance required  at

day   got your own crappuccino there  kent   right  what have we got   let's get suited and booted  boys   all impressed with you in there  the good money's on you making commander in three years   that's very generous  all part of the plan  joe   yes  sir  no need to be formal   it's what your father wanted  he'd be proud   we've got a dead woman in whitechapel   probable domestic  no di  bit of a rough squad  i'll take it   ready to head up your first murder  absolutely   good lad   once you've ticked that box we can get you out of the trenches and up to headquarters where you belong   i don't know what to say  how about thank you   thank you  sir   excellent   commander anderson's sending us a new di   oh   good   cos we don't know what we're doing  another fast tracker   oh  if i'd have known i'd have made vol au vents   i'll tell the others   now that's a good look   di chandler  ds miles   we'll get you suited up  this way   the victim's name was cathy lane    separated from her partner   she was found around 2am by a community support officer   cathy was still alive then  but by the time the emergency services got to her she was dead   who identified her  we all did  let's go   have you worked a murder scene before   i'm not a virgin  you know  i've had my fair share    oh  well  you'll be laughing then   streak of piss   hello  ray  we've got to stop meeting like this   wouldn't be the same without a dead body between us   morning  di chandler   can you see the cuts to her throat   on the side here we have the first incision   there is a second cut  more decisive  right round   this is a deep one  seems to go all the way through to the vertebrae   do you want to get a look at this  no  i'm good  i'm good   there's not much blood  no  it doesn't look like much   i know you're thinking she was dumped but you'd be wrong   it's all here  it's soaked into her clothing  she's sodden   interestingly  there's no struggle   there's a bruise here and more on the other side  with small petechial haemorrhages around the eyes  suggesting asphyxia   i think she was strangled first and this is how he dropped her   just a snapshot based on obvious injuries   patience   i want a detailed plan of the area  fitzgerald and mccormack are doing that   witnesses  mary bousfield  community support officer  this way   i saw a man with a long knife   he was over 40  dark coat   about 5'10    posh but shabby   had a funny hat  funny how   funny unusual   had flaps  did you see his face   i'm really sorry  i know police aren't supposed to cry   i cry all the time  mary   you should see my mascara run   thanks   let 'em get her off to hospital   cathy lane was a battered woman   she split from her partner six years ago   they argued about money for the kids  he wouldn't pay while she lived with other men   they'd have too much to drink  have huge rows   we were constantly banging him up in the cells for the night   once he stuck a potato peeler in her head  bang  like that   i knew we'd find her dead one day  who is this guy   rob lees  he's a butcher   works with long  sharp knives  let's go and talk to rob lees   don't you have a desk to go to   no   i don't   let's go   there you go  guv'nor  lovely  cheers  thanks  ta ta   police  yeah  can i have a word  please  sir   hello  jim  got a new boy   oi  you'll get me into trouble  he's the boss  oh  can i help you  sir   rob lees  rob's not here   do you know where he is  nah   his mobile's switched off and he's not picking up at home   has he been at cathy again   yeah   is she all right  she's dead   ohh   has rob got a woolly hat  'ey   a woolly hat  no  he wears one of those     furry russian things with flaps   yeah  get rob lees' flat watched   can we find out where his mobile is right now  and get someone down to his local   yeah  he is  i know  but what can you do   we'd better get a move on  before we go anywhere can we get something straight   i'm in charge of this investigation  i'm just showing you the ropes  son   i didn't expect this   welcome to hell  gentlemen   i think the killer knelt by her head  held her with his left hand   then cut her throat left to right with his right hand  the blood would have run away from him   there are no cuts to her clothing so i assume her skirt was pushed up   the community support pulled her skirt down but she thought she'd been raped   we'll take swabs but i haven't seen any physical signs of rape   and here's the surprise  it's as if he's tried to gut her   on the left hand side  two inches in  we have a deep  jagged wound   on the right hand side there are four more cuts   the stomach has been cut in several places  and the intestines have been exposed   i think he stayed at his position at her head   stabbed down  then draw the knife towards himself quite violently   these cuts were done quickly  i'd say the whole attack would have been over in a few minutes   she wouldn't have known what hit her  rob lees is what hit her   what can you tell us about the weapon  it has a strong blade   long  like something you use for butchering meat   the thing is  skin stretches and soft tissues compress  so it's hard to talk about knife size   i can only speculate very generally  so speculate for me   something like a hunting knife   or a boning knife  i can't rule it out   thanks  sweetheart   and there he is  half the division out looking for him   rob lees turns up on his own doorstep looking like ten kinds of shit   been up all night  smells like a pub   tell your mum you'll be home for tea  excellent   what are you doing  going to interview the suspect   why  dis are supposed to sit behind their desk and drink herbal tea   i'll treat it as an office outing   look  i know this guy  he's a liar  he's a manipulator   and what's worse  he knows his rights   so sit in if you have to  that's your prerogative   but i'm asking you to let me do what i'm good at   ok   sir   fine  but i want this resolved as much as you do   so we do this together  we get it right and we get it over with   ok  boys  phones off   hey  that's my seat  and that's my seat in there but we're all making sacrifices   this

won't miss hello   got to be a record that  shortest serving di   rob lees is no longer a suspect   everybody  listen  everybody  rob lees is no longer a suspect   now that we    now that we no longer

suspect so let's find him on cctv   he's wearing a hat with flaps so he should stick out like a sore thumb   sanders  you're good at watching tv  i am  you take first shift  fitz  draw up a rota   right  rob lees has been eliminated from this inquiry   we start afresh  consider this a new investigation   i need some chalk   i might have some   ha  i can wait   as long as it takes   teacher's pet  arse licker   thank you um    kent  kent   thank you  kent  right  our suspect is in his 40s   average height and build  dark complexion  wearing a hat with ear flaps   it's a distinctive look so let's start with cctv opportunities and find this guy   great idea  we'll start tomorrow  no  we start now   end of shift  unless you're authorising double time   oi   sorry   oh  dear god   what's his name  spell it for me   phwoar  who's let off   you're a detective  work it out  eh   tell him to wait upstairs   got a bloke upstairs says he knows everything about the murder   miles   i beg your pardon   in your own time  mr buchan   she was lying on her back     skirts pulled up   she looked like she was drunk   her throat was cut and her stomach had been mutilated   you saw the mutilation  not exactly   where were you standing when you saw cathy's body  oh  i wasn't there   mary ann nichols was the first canonical victim of jack the ripper  and she died on 31st august 1888   so  jesus christ   night   she also died next to a board school   i was describing her injuries to you  i don't bloody believe this   my book   it has all the canonical murders and some other events i think were linked   i think the man who killed your lady was copying jack the ripper   i'll bet she was lying on her back  head pointing east   eyes open  hands by her sides  palms open   legs out straight  slightly parted   a perfect re creation  you're a ripperologist  aren't you   why  yes  i am  and i also host an excellent ripper tour   a lot of the tour operators promote inaccurate theories   i pride myself on my strict adherence to the known facts   here's a fact  you're a loser   now get out before i nick you for wasting police time   keep the book  it'll help you predict  what the killer will do next   there are at least four more deaths to come if i'm right  out   you should be grateful  i'm giving you a head start   they never caught the ripper and time and history have spirited his identity away   get out  thank you for your time   every time there's a whitechapel stabbing  they come crawling out of the woodwork   i hate ripperologists   right   forensics  there's nothing   no prints  no fibres  no dna  nothing   witnesses   nobody heard anything   well  they all knew there was a fire  they heard the fire engines   no one heard a scream  a struggle  nothing   well  mary bousfield's a witness   talk to her  see if she remembers anything else  friends and family   well  everyone i spoke to was very upset   there were no enemies  no motive   right  so we've got no physical evidence  no witnesses   no known   no known motive   right   i want everything done again  knock on every door  talk to cathy's friends  go through cctv   how can you conduct an inquiry like this   look at the state of you  look at your desks   there could be actions here  clean it up and log it in   i want paperless desks   use your bins  you see  use your bins   and empty them at the end of every night   who's the office manager here   well   i am  sir  sort it out  mccormack  it's a disgrace   and haven't   haven't you heard of showers   or irons  i mean  where are your ties  where's your tie   get your feet off  where's your tie  i'll get one   it's no bloody surprise that potential witnesses aren't talking   you don't look professional  and it smells in here   get yourselves organised  self discipline  self respect  deodorant  go   this is what real policemen look like   this is what real policemen smell like   i wouldn't expect you to understand   your courses may look good on paper but they count for nothing here   we're not paper policemen   this is a murder investigation  not a beauty contest   i think he's got obsessive compulsive disorder   never known a man so obsessed with cleanliness in my life  must be gay   ooh  do you think  i've got gaydar   i can tell  going to have a shower then   am i going to have a shower   fresh as a daisy   oh  my god  i've found him  i've found him   this is from the camera at puma court just before the murder   there's the hat   looks like a deerstalker   he looks like sherlock holmes   or jack the ripper  oh  shut up  you nonce   what's he wearing under his coat   it's an apron    'keep the book   it'll help you predict what the killer will do next   there are at least four more deaths to come if i'm right '  'the star's headline read  leather apron    the only name linked with the whitechapel murders   a noiseless midnight terror   a strange character who prowls about whitechapel after midnight   universal fear among the women   there was a great fire the night mary ann nichols died  only streets away from where she had her throat cut and body mutilated '  oh  shit   hello  are you all here for the world famous buchan's guider ripper tour   good o  if you'd all like to step in  please  save the old voice   now  we will be visiting all the sites of the ripper's murders  as well as some of his regular haunts   so i must ask if everyone here is over 18   are you over 18  young lady  yes   good o  now     this is a two hour walk and it is not suitable for those of a weak or squeamish disposition   it will be dark   it will be frightening   and maybe tonight we shall see some of the ghosts   of whitechapel   ok  that's   10 per person  please   thank you  sir  ah  thank you   thank you  thank you   thank you  sir  enjoy the tour   we're going off piste tonight   none of the other tours come here  they don't appreciate its significance   this passageway was known as george yard  and it was here on a first floor landing on 7 august 1888  that a terrible discovery was made   a woman   stabbed 39 times and left to die   her name was martha tabram   and she may have been the ripper's first victim   some ripperologists discount her since her throat wasn't cut  nor was she mutilated   she's not a ripper victim  they say  doesn't fit the pattern   ah   a serial killer does not emerge fully formed   even he must learn his craft   and jack learned quickly   let us visit the place where he killed his first canonical victim   mary ann nichols   i think this man has killed before  i want to look for previous in the last few months or so   a murder with overkill  39 stab wounds to the torso and legs   and this is from where  it's an idea   idea  it might be nothing   it is  the ripper's for tourists  you're ignoring the possibility    there was no murder like that here  are you sure   course i am  it's my job to know   serious assault  maybe she survived  you are kidding   you've been given a job  will you    just do it   sir   kent  there was a fire on the night of the murder   it might be connected  find out all you can  yes  sir   and it's not father's day  you're not the world's greatest lover and     what does iofb mean   i only fire blanks   the wife got it for me after i got the snip  get them off   no sense of humour  that's his problem   he don't want to be one of us   he's like a wife who wants to change all your bad habits   another plastic copper  not a real detective  sarge   i think you should see this   emma jones  august 7  she was found with a lump on her head and 39 stab wounds   spot on  sir  did she identify her attacker   she said he was young  around 5'9   with dark hair  and she reckoned he was a soldier   why  she saw tattoos  thought they were regimental   which regiment  sir  she was stabbed  a murder in a school yard  an attempted murder by a squaddie  is there a connection   i want to talk to her  she's in hospital  kent  come with me   i've got to pack this in  buy a nice wee pub in the country or something   he doesn't look well  i hate hospitals   what do you think's wrong with him   excuse me  dr phillips  please   i'm looking for dr phillips  are you sure  maybe i could help you   dr phillips  please   he's not here  i think he swapped shifts with dr cohen   maybe he can help you  thank you   i didn't treat emma jones but i am aware of her case   does this account look familiar    left lung penetrated in five places  the right lung in two   heart penetrated once  liver penetrated five times   spleen twice and the stomach six times   the wound on the breastbone made a long instrument  possibly a bayonet   well  this is the attack on emma jones   no  it's an attack that happened over 100 years ago   ah  yes  heart penetrated once  i see   in emma jones's case the knife glanced off the ribs   the heart was not pierced  is that why she survived   that and the ambulance  i'd like to speak to her  please   that's not possible  she's in intensive care  even so   in a coma   i'm sorry   thank you   why would somebody copy a hundred year old murder   they never caught the ripper   did they come close  perhaps  but we'll never know   the real jack probably committed suicide after the last murder   maybe he plunged into the icy thames taking his secrets with him   and we are left with his legacy   the birth of the serial killer   my book  an encyclopaedia of facts   all the clues you need to start your own hunt for jack   will you be the one to find the ripper   thank you very much  oh  thank you  thank you   that was very interesting  thank you  good tour  guden abend   oh  i normally get a few bites   wasn't on song tonight  too many germans  they don't give much back   i like the yanks  great enthusiasm   and they like a souvenir   can i have a word  absolutely   you can buy me a drink   so  i suppose you're the ripper's biggest fan   oh  i don't think fan is the right word  i don't admire what he did   you seem to enjoy the murders though  all the details   you pretty much live it every night  oh  dear   i am a performer for the tourist hordes  that is true  but       in my heart i'm a detective like your fine self   you know what's it's like  the irresistible siren call of a mystery   the delectable twist of a conundrum   we are slaves to that delicious eureka moment when the scales fall away  and everything is laid bare   there's no eureka moment in what i do  i follow the bloody footprints and arrest the man holding the knife   but that is tragic   to be a detective and not have the fire   so you're more interested in being a detective than a ripper    i'd be a poor man's ripper   only able to dispatch small dogs and ladies under five foot  can you imagine   on the night of the murder i watched my mother sing with the church choir in aid of the roof restoration fund   i fell asleep and disturbed everyone with my snoring   can you help me   yes   the man who murdered cathy lane       will kill again   ok  this is the pattern   emma jones  stabbed 39 times   martha tabram  stabbed 39 times   cathy lane  throat cut  mutilated   mary ann nichols  throat cut  mutilated  31 august 1888   the man who attacked and killed these women in 1888 was jack the ripper   the man who's attacking these women in 2008 is his biggest fan   we have a copycat  oh  here we go again   come on  this is your patch  you should have spotted this   you should be ashamed that it's taken a plastic like me to work this out   all right  all right   the ripper only killed prostitutes  correct   so you think emma and cathy were on the game   no  there's nothing to suggest either of them were toms  good point   were they attacked in the same place as his victims   those places no longer exist  the slums were cleared and the roads changed   with the greatest of respect  these women were attacked in unconnected locations by different people   a soldier in his 20s  about 5'9   and a 40 something man wearing a deerstalker hat   different people  different location   you had a theory but     you're new to this and it's easy to get carried away with all the history in the area   game over  right  who's hungry   the killer could be dressing up to match the historical suspects   dressing up  so he's a perv then   no  no  no  no  no   so that the witness descriptions match what the police had in 1888   the police looked for a soldier after tabram's death   the prime suspect with jones's stabbing is a soldier   prime suspect with mary ann nichols  a man in a leather apron   think about it   the guy in the cctv had an apron under his coat   skip  i thought jack the ripper had a black bag  a top hat and walked through smog   i think that'd draw attention in brick lane  don't you   september 8 1888  the next victim was annie chapman   i think on 8 september we'll have a murder on hanbury street   we need to be there to stop it   i've heard it all now  total crap   joe  what you're proposing goes against all procedures   you gain nothing by chasing bogeymen and stand to lose everything  i see a pattern emerging   you're ambitious and that's good  but you're letting your ambition cloud your judgement   you want this murder to have meaning because death should be significant but in truth most murders are banal   i'm not imagining this  take my advice   step back a little  detach yourself   and if another woman dies   then we never had this conversation   this obbo's a waste of time  no one will get murdered tonight  by a copycat jack the ripper   so eat up   if my mother could see you now  do you know what she'd say   she'd say you shouldn't chase any suspects till at least half an hour after you've finished eating   half an hour  we'd be here all night  mate   our historical murder won't happen till 5am   i thought i could eat but you take the biscuit   come on  this is a farewell meal for our good friend di chandler   he gambled and he lost   this is his last supper   on expenses   can we have more beers   when i eat curry i can smell it on my pits the next day   do you want one  sir  oh  no  thanks   you should  you look like a copper on an obbo   what he means  sir  is that you need to relax  blend in   make it look like you're on the lash   nothing remains of no 29 hanbury street   and this is as close as we can get     to where the body of annie chapman was found in the back yard  on this very night in 1888   and it was a terrible sight   he didn't just cut her throat  oh  no   he tried to cut her head off   he split her open and threw her intestines over her shoulder       like a grotesque scarf   not much left of poor annie chapman   just a few sad belongings at her feet   moving on   good luck to you  sirs   we should check him out   he just seems to know a lot about it   it's his job   funny job   bloody waste of time  resources and my patience   i told you nothing'd happen   as soon as we're stood down i'm having a word with the commander   i'm having a slash    that's it for the di then   not so much fast track as bus fare home   you going to call it then  sir   i tried  didn't i   you did save a life tonight  yeah   i'll put it on my cv   where is he   number four  round the back    establish the perimeter  get dr llewellyn   get miles and then follow me   ds miles  ds miles  come in  over  skip   skip  we're up  oh  jesus    'he took hold of her by the chin  and commenced the incision from left to right   an attempt had been made to separate the bones of the neck   the abdomen had been entirely laid open   the intestines lifted out of the body     and placed by the shoulder of the corpse '  it's the ripper   he was right  weren't he  yeah   congratulations  you were right   all you have to do now is solve theunsolvable  and catch the most famous serial killer that ever lived   good luck   the double event is imminent  the night he killed two women   a soldier has been beating up girls and threatening to gut them   we've got a prime suspect  you'll be the man who captured the ripper   transcript chocolate
