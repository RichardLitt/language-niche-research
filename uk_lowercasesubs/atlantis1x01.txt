  you look just like him   your dad   he'd stand there  just staring at the ocean   i don't suppose there's any way i can talk you  out of going down there   you could try  but you'd be wasting your time   even if you locate the wreckage of his sub  what then   i have to know what happened to him   do you think your dad would have wanted you to risk your life   when he took the sub down       he knew he wasn't coming back   he gave it to me before he left   he told me that one day i'd understand   i need to know   i hope you find it   whatever it is you're looking for   you're clear to dive  'roger that '  mac   mac  come in   mac   jason   hey   hey  hey   hey   sorry   i'm dreaming   ooh   no  no  no   this lizard thing attacked me   sorry   ah  oh   arghh     ugh  oh   oh   thank you  thanks  thank you   what exactly were you doing out there   search every house  find him  open up in there   i didn't do anything   one minute i was on the sub   and there was something in the water  a white light   and the next thing i know  i'm waking up on the beach   and there's this city   and everyone's wearing strange clothes   and there's a two headed lizard   and people with swords  they're chasing me   and they're firing arrows at me   i know it's insane  what's a  sub    open up  open up   by order of king minos  open up  no  please  please   who is it you are looking for   a fugitive   no  no  no  that's mine  no   as you can see  there is no one else here   really    argh   what happened  you passed out  you've lost a lot of blood   where am i   you're in atlantis   atlantis   as in  the lost city of atlantis    as in the mythological city under the ocean   why do you call it lost  how could a city exist under the ocean   surely everyone would drown   either i'm dreaming or i'm hallucinating   or i'm dead   am i dead   no  you're very much alive  although i think you're delirious   i'm sorry  i'm forgetting my manners   i'm pythagoras   pythagoras  you're joking   you're the triangle guy   how did you know i've been thinking about triangles   i'm in ancient greece   and who  pray tell  is this   you didn't tell me your name   it's jason  he was injured  the guards were after him   and you chose to hide him here   are you out of your mind   don't mind hercules   you're hercules   i see my reputation has preceded me   tell me  what have you heard  do people tell stories   what do they say  well  they generally say you're getting fat   i'm not fat  i am heavily built  powerful  i have big bones   in your stomach  you'll have to excuse my friend   he is under the deluded impression that he is amusing  tell me   your injury  can you walk   yes  i think so  good  then we shan't detain you any longer   i'm sure you're a good man  an excellent man   but i  for one  am not about to risk my neck to save yours   see that he's gone by the time i get back   where are you going  that is none of your concern   so  what brings you    to atlantis   i was searching for my father   he lives here in atlantis   i don't know  i     i don't know where to start   your necklace   i have seen this symbol before   where   in the temple of poseidon   it is the mark of the oracle   if you're looking for your father  she may be able to help you   you wish to see the oracle   she is expecting you   what is it you wish to know   there must be many questions to which you wish to know the answer   what is this place   where am i   this world and the world you journeyed from  are just two worlds among many   why does it feel so familiar to me   how can that be   there are some memories that can never be erased   how can i have memories of a place that i have never been   you cannot   you're saying that this is where i'm from   that i was born in atlantis   your father took you to the other world when you were still a baby   why   why would he do that   you have many enemies here in atlantis   you must tell no one that you journeyed through the gateway   my father   is he here in atlantis   what happened to him   your father       walks among the dead   my mother   i was told that she died shortly after i was born   is this true   who was she   there are some things that even i     cannot see   then  if my father's dead  why am i here   why was i brought here   you were drawn here       by forces so powerful that they stretch between the worlds   yeah  but why  jason       only you     can bring an end to the people's fear and suffering   what do you mean   what am i to do   we tell ourselves we are lost  but really we know what we must do   i don't know anything about this world   the first rays of the rising sun       will light the path you must follow   i don't understand   answer me   i need to know more  you must go now   no  no  i have too many questions   there is nothing more the oracle can tell you  you must leave   go   why did you not tell him the truth   because       it will be much safer for him if he doesn't know who he really is   did you see the oracle   and did she have any knowledge of your father   she told me my father is dead   i am truly sorry for your loss   will you be returning home now   i'm not sure where my home is   i never truly felt i belonged where i came from   i was always searching for something     until now  i didn't know why   what are they doing   the tributes will be selected tomorrow   they have come to pray to poseidon   what are these tributes   each year  atlantis is required to send seven of its citizens  as an offering to the minotaur   that actually exists  well  of course   they say it was once a man   when he defied the gods  they punished him   turning him into a monster  cursed to feed on human flesh   and you just send these people to their deaths   well  if we do not  then the gods will punish us   poseidon  the earth shaker  will lay waste to the city   that's insane  seven die so 20 000 can live   that's what we tell ourselves each year  but it doesn't make it any easier   it's getting late   there is a curfew the night before they select the tributes   they don't want to give people the chance  to submit to their fear and flee the city   do you have somewhere to stay tonight  no   then you shall stay with us   what about hercules   he's usually so drunk when he returns from the tavern   he won't even notice you're there   i don't wish to be rude     but what  in the name of the gods  is he still doing here   i said he could stay with us   he has just learnt that his father is dead   i am very sorry to hear that  but we are harbouring a fugitive   and i think you're forgetting  it's my house   and i think you're forgetting who settled your gambling debts  to prevent your house being sold from under your feet   i paid you back  no  you didn't actually   i am going to pay you back   he hasn't got anywhere else to go   we can't cast him out onto the street   there are some blankets in the chest   thank you  i think i shall       have an early night   what is it  nothing   see you in the morning   pythagoras  what is it   it's hercules  he's gone   i saw him creeping out   he's trying to flee the city     before they select the tributes   if the guards catch him  they will execute him on sight   there he is   hercules   don't do it  if you flee  you will be banished   you can never return to atlantis   and if i stay  i die   you don't know that  you take your chances with everyone else   my fate has already been decided   i've consulted the oracle   she has seen it  i must go to the labyrinth and face the minotaur   no    i won't be sent to my death   i am not ready to die   come with me  we can make pathmos by sunrise   i cannot do that   my home is here     in atlantis   then     i fear this is goodbye   hercules   aggggghhh   are you injured  where does it hurt  everywhere   they've released the hunting lions  hunting lions   who the hell has hunting lions   climb  i am climbing  you call that climbing    you call that pushing    pull  i am pulling   that wasn't so hard   jason  jason   how did you do that   i  er     don't know   the tributes are to be selected   we are to gather before king minos at the temple   i'm afraid you chose the wrong time to arrive in atlantis   you will be forced to draw a lot   perhaps it's meant to be   what about him   we'd better sober him up   i should be in pathmos  waking in the arms of a beautiful woman   because of you  i face my death   if it weren't for us  you wouldn't be here at all   you would be in the belly of a lion   on this day  every adult citizen of atlantis must draw lots   if you draw a white stone  then poseidon has spared you   if you draw a black stone  then it is your duty  to offer yourself as a sacrifice to the minotaur   your families should be proud     for your sacrifice will appease the gods   and protect all that live in our great city   that's another white stone gone   the black stones are creeping up to the surface  just waiting for me to pick one   it's white  i've got a white stone  praise the gods   the stone will not draw itself   maybe you could kill the minotaur   perhaps if you were to smuggle a sword in your robes   you have always said that there is no man more useless  with a sword than i   i was joking   you're clever  there is no man more clever than you   perhaps you could trick the minotaur   you could trick it into     you'll think of something  i know you will   you have to   think of something   it's going to eat me alive  isn't it   we're not going to let that happen   there must be a way we can get you out of the city   if i escape  then some other poor  unfortunate soul  will have to take my place   i'm not sure i could live with that   well  i can think of no two finer people  with whom i would wish to spend     my last supper   to friends   maybe you could talk about triangles and bore the minotaur to death   you know  triangles are very  very interesting   there is something about the angles they create    no  i will not have it   we are not going to spend your last supper discussing triangles   where are you going ariadne  you haven't touched your food   i have no appetite knowing seven of our citizens  will be sent to their deaths tomorrow   it saddens us all   but the gods must be appeased or poseidon will destroy the city   the people have done nothing to deserve this   it is you that the gods wish to punish   how dare you question your father   you bring shame on our family   it is not i who shames our family   there is a limit to a father's love for his daughter   even one as beautiful as you   you would do well to remember that   there is no greater honour than to give your life for your city       and your king   why are you among the tributes   i saw you draw a white stone   my friend drew a black stone   i am here in his place   i owe him my life   and now you will give yours as a sacrifice   you are willing to die to save him   the oracle told me that this is the path i must follow   i believe i'm meant to kill the minotaur   do you believe you'll succeed where so many have failed   i cannot explain it     and yet it's as if  for the first time in my life   i feel absolutely certain of what i must do   what is your name   jason   as a child  i'd often play in the labyrinth at hawara   i would tie one end of a skein of thread to the entrance   if ever i got lost   i would follow it until i found my way back out   it has been enchanted by the witches of colchis   the thread will not tangle or break   i hope it will be of some use to you in the labyrinth   thank you   you are being called   hercules   hercules   it's jason  he's taken the black stone   oh   huh  oh     jason   it should have been me  it was my stone   pythagoras  your theories and your triangles are destined  to bore millions of children throughout history   that's your fate  this is mine   so  now you're packing   if we'd have left the city when i said   none of this would have happened  are you coming with me   no  i am not  not a chance   what is it you plan to do   i plan to reach the caves first and sneak in with the weapons   it's the only way jason has a chance   what if we were to sneak into the caves   leave the weapons for jason  and then sneak back out again   would that satisfy your misplaced loyalty   jason saved your life     that is a matter for debate     and he offered himself as a tribute in my place   i won't let him face the minotaur alone   we will give you a moment to pray to the gods   we're too late   pythagoras  no   seize them   jason   you  and you   it seems the gods have answered your prayers   most noble of you to volunteer like this   we weren't volunteering  we were merely gathering stones   take them to the caves   we have a collection of stones     there is honour to be found in everything   even in death   you know how i've always said there's no man more useless  with a sword than you  well  i was wrong   it appears we've found someone   i've seen four year old girls with a stronger grip   what's your name  helena   look  we'll find a way out  stay close   which way   i'll see where this tunnel leads  wait here until i return   what is it   i thought i saw something  we should keep moving   we have to wait for jason   run   what happened   the minotaur  it found us  where's hercules and the others   i don't know  we all ran  we got separated   you're bleeding   i fell and hit my head  i'm fine   helena   go   helena   thank you  jason   how do you know my name   it was foretold   only you could lift the curse the gods placed on me   i did a great wrong   i betrayed your father   you knew my father   you must be wary of minos  he must never find out     find out what   who you truly are   this is just the beginning   you have a great destiny   what do you mean   who am i   the earth bull       has been slain   it is as you saw   the boy truly is the answer to our prayers   others will come to realise that       soon enough   and they will seek to destroy him   for more than 20 years  atlantis has suffered this curse   no more shall we be required to send our citizens  as an offering to the minotaur   this day  the gods look favourably upon us   the city of atlantis owes you a great debt   thank you  my lord   the name's hercules  you may have heard of my       heroic     it was of greater use than you can possibly imagine   who was that young man   he is of no consequence   so  it seems our money troubles are over  how so   people will pay handsomely for the services of the men who killed the minotaur   we shall grow rich  and live like hogs   really  and how was it exactly that you killed the minotaur   i meant  we   together  you weren't even there   you were too busy running in the other direction   i was trying to draw the minotaur away from the rest of the group   oh  so you were just pretending to be a coward   now you've slain the minotaur  you think you're a big hero   so  you admit it was me that killed the minotaur   say what you like  whoever heard of a hero called jason   it's a ridiculous name   now hercules  that is a name to father a legend   oh  yes   the legend of hercules    the man who fled the minotaur    you're an idiot  pythagoras  at least he's not    i'm not fat  i'm big boned   why do i sense that you're not telling me the whole truth   because  above anything  i must protect you  from those who would do you harm   jason   my name is medusa
