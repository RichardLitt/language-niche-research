oh  god  oh  god   please  please  please   'listen to me now  stay on the line but make yourself safe '  sirens blare  boss   so  reid was right   this is where you spend your gardening leave  is it   staring down a big hole   we have the madsen verdict   given the exceptional circumstances  the inquiry have found no grounds for disciplinary action   which means you're back   if you want it   i want it   rule number one  don't get yourself into this situation again   which means you observe case management protocol   any pro active strategies are to be signed off by me  i don't sign  they don't happen   is that the speech  that's the speech   it's a good speech  thank you  it's one i prepared earlier   you and zoe  you spoken   no  not for a while  and  it was a trial separation   i tried it   didn't like it   she feel the same   rose  i did everything she asked for  got myself together   so  now we'll see   well  that's the difference between her and me   she talks about taking you back  i actually do it   dci john luther  ds justin ripley   morning  sir  nice to meet you   welcome back and   whatever   yes  shall we  all right   so  do we need to have the chat   what chat  i was sick  i got better  i'm back  etc  er  then  no   we don't need the chat  good   i've lobbied to be stationed with you   i put in the request nine months ago   chased it up three times a week in writing   so  what we got  er  home invasion   murder  victims are douglas and laura morgan  who called it in   the daughter  alice morgan   she was out when it happened  doing   buying bread and milk   she live there  no  she's a research fellow for some department of physics   she lives in a flat near campus  why the family gathering   douglas morgan's birthday   right  let's go   sir   our first responders have this down as point of entry   the daughter left it unlocked when she went out   we need to look for indication that the shooter was watching the house   possible vantage points  hiding places  good line of sight   you might want to keep your hands in your pockets   reduces temptation to touch anything   sleeping pills   separate bedrooms  what does that tell you   husband snored   anything else   hard to say  sometimes separate beds make for a happy marriage   that's a very generous thought   it's good   he didn't hear it coming   he's a published poet  small press   so  no sign of burglary  no attempt to stage a scene  and no sexual assault   contract killing  maybe  well  it's workable   i mean  the shooter has done his homework   he knows the layout of the place  he eliminates any physical threat  the dog   douglas  what kind of weapon was it   some kind of low calibre handgun   some kind  no gun  they are still searching   house  grounds  drains  nothing so far   yes  see  someone that efficient  you would expect him to ditch the gun at the scene   am i missing something  does that seem right to you   none of it seems right to me  because it's not right  is it   it's not right   i'll meet you upstairs  yeah  yeah  sure   phone dials  phone rings  zoe luther   'hey  babe  it's me ' john  hi   guess what  sir   'what ' the board of inquiry come down on my side   oh  john  that's really good news  that's great  i mean  i knew they would  obviously  but     yeah  and i'm back at work  'already '  well  they missed me   'what's wrong  babe '  nothing's wrong  i'm just on my way to a meeting  that's all  look  can we talk a bit later   that's why i was calling  really  i think that we  well we need to have that talk   tonight i've got a dinner   after dinner  i'll come round   ok  tonight  look  i'm sorry  i really do have to go  um    so    'what '  i've got myself together  all right   i'm back  and i feel great  i'm good   you know   i know   i know   she hangs up  welcome back  sir  welcome back   for you  thank you   what does it say   you don't have to be mad to work here  but it helps    good to see you   well  thank you   so  they welcomed you back with a weird one   yeah  they did welcome me back with a weird one   you  honour killing  ouch   so  how are you   splendid   excellent  then  good   miss luther  i'm mark north  i remember  yes   did you tell him   zoe  he needs to know   all this sneaking around  it's mad  you've been separated for months   he's the only one that doesn't seem to know  i know  i know  i know  i know   i wasn't going to tell him when he was     you know  getting better   now i wake up  i feel sick  i've got this permanent knot in my stomach   it's going to kill him  you can't keep lying   it's cruel   miss morgan  alice  please   alice  hello  i'm john luther   senior investigating officer  can i   you must be very tired   yes  i am   i don't think i've ever been this tired   it's shock   it's the way our body reacts  it's one of those strange things   alice  i know this has been a terrible  terrible day for you   things look bleak  and you must be feeling very alone   but  believe me when i say we will do everything we can to find out who did this  thank you   so  these things i'm going to ask you  i have to ask  i'm sorry   let me turn this on   do you have any idea who would wish harm on your parents   even if it's just a feeling   a sense of unease about someone   something you heard your mum or dad say   something that didn't sit right  no   there's nothing  my mum was a very kind  very     very gracious woman   can i get you a glass of water   no  i'm sorry  i'll be ok  a cup of tea  i'm just    it's ok  it's ok   and your dad   he was a very admirable man  just     the thing is  alice     this was a very singular crime   no sign of robbery   and no apparent  and i'm sorry   sexual motivation  now  i've been a police officer for a very long time   and one of the things that i've found is that crimes like this aren't random   and never without motive  so  as painful as this is   i'm going to ask you to dig deep and really think     about any money issues your parents may have been experiencing   any marital difficulties   i've done nothing but think  all i do is think  there is nothing   there's absolutely nothing   guv  so  he's back  from outer space   you do know the man is nitroglycerine   with respect  sir  a comprehensive investigation under your edict cleared him of any wrongdoing   not least because the only other witness is in a coma   measuring three on the glasgow scale   and mia dalton is in school today  and not in the ground   rose  if you bet too heavily on luther  then you stand or fall with him   and with you goes this unit  and my credibility as its architect   haven't you worked too hard for too long to take that big a risk on such a wild card   i don't consider him a risk  then what is he  an investment   and if henry madsen wakes up and gives his account of what happened that night     will luther drag us all down   let's hope not   so just one more time so i'm absolutely clear   you saw nothing or anyone unusual   i'm sorry   i wish i could tell you i had   i've got this feeling  this     strange feeling like i'm looking at it down the wrong end of a telescope   like it happened years ago   that can happen with stress   different parts of the brain take over   we remember things in different ways   he yawns  i'm so sorry  it's been a long day   really  it's fine   it's very tiring going round and round like this   you must be exhausted   can i get you a coffee   tea would be nice   she did it  she did it  look at this   i'm so sorry   it's been a long day  look  she didn't yawn   she didn't yawn  someone in a room yawns  you yawn  see  even talking about it   it's to do with the parts of the brain that deal with empathy   she didn't yawn  she did it   and he's back  nothing in her affect points to survivor guilt    why them  why not me    that's pretty atypical   so her affect's off  it could be medication  shock  whatever  except it's not   this kind of scenario  an offender typically tries to stage the scene   make it look like murder  suicide  a burglary gone wrong   but  she did none of that  exactly  exactly how   because she's proud of this  why give anyone else the credit   to alibi herself  she doesn't care about alibis   she's a malignant narcissist  this is about prestige  power  self affirmation   the timeline doesn't work   three minutes before she called 999 she was at the shops   there's not enough time  there's not enough anything   absence is the point   it's a way of her saying to us  look at me    so where's the gun  it's got to be somewhere   everything's somewhere  i don't know   say that again  that was special   i don't know where the gun is   no  she doesn't look the type  that's the thing about people  they always find ways to surprise you   tea   is your chair ok   comfy   it's fine  thank you  only sometimes  we like to shorten one of the legs   so the suspect can never get comfortable   never relax  always unbalanced   is it too hot   really  it's fine   'i see you got your phd at 18 years old   'astrophysics  was it '  'dark matter distribution in disc galaxies '  'dark matter   that's the stuff that makes up the universe   but it doesn't interact with the things we know and in the way we expect   no  but its presence can be inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter   we know it's there   both  we just can't see it   would many police officers be able to gain my trust by having this conversation   i don't know  i just like to read books   it beats burning them   no but you're the one that's practically a genius   only practically   see so you went to oxford at what   thirteen  wow  that's young   these child prodigies  they're not one thing or the other  they're sort of freaks really   but i expect your parents were    proud   very   there were newspaper articles   pictures of mum  dad and me  smiling in the library   when i was nine  i proved tangent minus 1x   they bought me a dress   got me on the news   i wonder what that was like  you know 13 years old  classmates were what  20  22   no friends your age   no boyfriends  quite a presumption   actually  i matured very early     sexually   alice  are you familiar with ockham's razor    all things being equal  the simplest solution is the best solution    that's right   and what that principle tells me is  the only other person known to have been  at your parents' house this morning     it was you   i don't see how it's possible to arrive at that conclusion   well  there was no evidence of an intruder   but absence of evidence  isn't evidence of absence   i know  i'm making a leap   it's a little leap though   it's more of a hop  is this where you ask me if i hated my parents   it is about that time  yeah   did they make me a freak  yes  did i hate them  absolutely   did i kill them   no  can you prove that  i can't prove a negative   it can't be done  innocence is a negative  it's the absence of guilt   meaning the burden of proof is entirely yours   if you think i did this  then you need to demonstrate how and when   i know  and i won't be able to do that  will i   well  you can certainly try  because there is nothing   you don't interact with the things we know in the way that we expect   your presence  your actions  can only be inferred by a certain     absence  is that a compliment   absolutely  ah  are you trying to beguile me  no  i wouldn't be so foolish   but i will tell you this  alice  you can revel in your brilliance for as long as you like   but people slip up   happens time and time again   well  that's just faulty logic postulated on imperfect data collection   what if you only catch people who make mistakes   that would skew the figures  wouldn't it   yes  it would   but criminals aren't as smart as they think they are   oh  that must get monotonous   for someone as brilliant as you   ian  am i wrong  you're not wrong  no   guv  there's got to be something we can find to charge her with   such as  being a space oddity   such as  she killed them   right now  she's little girl lost  we've got no real motive   she hated her parents  seriously  who doesn't   there's no forensics  no witnesses  timeline alone gets it laughed out the cps  you saw her in there   it excites her that we know she did it  so  find me the gun  put it in her hand   until then  cut her loose and send her home   thank you very much  miss morgan  you're free to go   well  i enjoyed our chat   you're very interesting   wow  nice dress   just come from dinner  come in   what's wrong  you look tired   me  oh  no i'm all right  why   what's wrong   john  i know    i know what you came here to discuss   but before you say anything  you need to know that i've met somebody   sorry  i met someone   what do you mean  you met     someone  who   someone   what do you mean  er  zoe   when   a while ago  who  it doesn't matter   it does matter   are you sleeping with him   no  no  no  no  no  no  no   zoe  no  zoe  no   why would you do that   why  zoe come on  why   hmm   go home  john   this is my home   no   zoe called   there we are  all right   are you going to say anything   anything you'd like me to say  no   then why say it   where you going   do you ever get a song stuck in your head   and it just keeps going round and round and round   t'pau  china in your hand  cool  deep strangeness  that song   high weirdness  i've been thinking   she's a narcissist  isn't she   she needs constant recognition  needs to exaggerate her accomplishments   how does someone like that keep secret the most perfect thing she ever did   you don't need to be thinking about alice morgan right now   why  what do you suggest i think about  hmm   my wife  henry madsen   i don't know  normal stuff  breakfast   the way alice morgan sees it  is this world is full of people that have offended her  embarrassed her   let her down  and those people deserve to be punished   she's already gotten away with it once and she's eyeing her next victim   and she won't stop until someone stops her  until i stop her   all right so be patient  build a case  there is no case   she didn't leave one  she didn't leave anything   what  so what you thinking  well  she's compelled to impress   people in general  but right now me in particular   she needs to show me how brilliant she is  she needs to be admired   john    and i give that to her   i take it away  i make her angry   and then i watch her get careless   slow down  i'll call you later   they burned my dog  it's protocol  it's what happens   he was only a dog   it seems unduly pitiless to me  to burn someone's dog   it seems kind of pitiless to shoot the dog in the first place   you look exhausted  would you like to come in    would it make a difference  who knows  no  we're not   so  you're not here to interrogate me   no   liar   this is a black hole   it consumes matter  sucks it in and crushes it beyond existence   when i first heard that  i thought  that's evil at its most pure   something that drags you in  crushes you  makes you       nothing  i love to talk about nothing   it's the only thing i know anything about  don't you believe in evil   i have to  i've seen it  ah   henry madsen  henry and others like him   me   conceivably   what's happening to your marriage  huh  last time i saw you  there was a ring  today  no ring   is someone else involved   i'm not here to discuss that  alice   is he handsome   if you like that sort of thing  i guess  are you in pain   you don't understand love  alice   it's not your fault  you can mimic it and i guess you can recognise it in other people   but you will never be able to understand love     no   because you'd be surprised how many men do   do you think they have any idea how fatuous they look   well  some of us are afraid of that  yeah  then why  why did i come here   because i wanted to tell you that i know you kept the gun and sooner or later i'll find it   well  why would i do that  ah  you just couldn't help yourself  could you   wouldn't it make things easy for you if that were true  but it's not   there's no gun to find  see keeping that gun wasn't a rational decision   it was a compulsion  you did it because you needed to do it   and it's that compulsion that makes you weak in ways that you can't see or understand   and it's that compulsion that's going to get you caught   and it will bring you down  alice  it always does  just like clockwork   are you threatening me  because honestly  i wouldn't   and why's that  come now  really   because i'd be hurt and angry   i wonder   why did your wife turn her face from you  john   why would she do that     i'm coming for you   not if i come for you first   morning   out you two  go on  john  raus   raus  come on  if you're thinking of calling security  don't bother  call the police  let's go  arriba   arriba  andale  andale  he's joking  this is his sense of humour  this is my husband  john   that's right  i am her husband   way to get me sacked   john  the people in this office  they don't know you  they're scared   they think you're going to do something   do i embarrass you   right now  right at this moment  absolutely   yes  is that what this is all about   no  am i boring   hm  boring  because  personally  i don't think that i am boring   you're not boring  you're the opposite of boring  and him   his name's mark  does a woman just get to a stage in her life when she says    you know what  i'd like my man to be boring    because i have to tell you  no one warned me about this  he's not boring   is the sex good   it's not about the sex  it's always about the sex   you enjoy sex with him  you must   and that image just goes round and round in my head like a train   the trouble with you  that train in your head never stops   you really frightened me last night   come on  zoe  you know i'd never  ever hurt you   john  why are you here  well  i couldn't help but wonder  if perhaps you'd like to come home and be married to me   some men bring flowers    what  this was a grand gesture   this is professional ruination  is what this is   next time  think flowers   next time   you know what i mean   i just need to know why  you always do   but not everything has a motive  sometimes things just happen     that's not true  everything has a reason  there are physical laws  i mean how did we     how did we get here  one minute i'm one place and then next minute  i'm 15 000 miles away and i know that i've travelled  because i'm dizzy and i just want to throw up   i just can't remember the bits in between  you tell me   how do you think we got here   what happened   ok   you're the reason   you are  you left   but i'm here   now  look at me  i'm here   only part of you  never all  you care more about the dead than the living   that's where your heart is  that is not true   all those years spent up to your neck in malignancy  all those months looking for henry madsen   all the months that came after  and you were just    gone   and you weren't coming back  not  not my you  not my john  then him   when he's with me  he's with me   is that all it takes  zoe  eh   do you love him   yes   i'm sorry   oh  er     and me   always  but not like that   not any more   look  i know it's a cruel thing to hear  but you need to accept it  john   if you love me  you need to accept it   i don't know how to do that   knock on door  could you open the door please  sir   could you open the door  please   i'm a policeman   i'm a policeman   how did you know i was here  your phone was off  di reed said  try the wife    oh  yeah  any news on the gun that killed the morgans   we're still looking but ballistics came back on the bullets   for ultra compact weapons   good work   sod it    raus  raus   mother of god   zoe gasps  don't look at me  ok  ok  shh  ok  ok  ok   your husband assaulted me  what   he touched me  intimately   he made me do things  he hurt me  because of you  what do you mean   well  as he touched me  he talked about you  he said you were dead  that you'd been very badly burned   your face was gone and your skin was gone   you'd been abducted off the street by a man  a very sick man   he kept you alive for days   he used knives   a blow torch  he kept pieces of you for souvenirs   i'm worried that someone might want to hurt you like that   please  please don't  shh  shh     phone rings  dci john luther   zoe  hey  hey  hey  what's wrong   bloody hell   honestly guv  you should have just let me hold her   you didn't give me enough to hold her   and you can't prove it was her this afternoon   zoe didn't see her face  no cctv  no eye witnesses  no nothing   you do know this makes me alice morgan's next project   i questioned her brilliance  offended her   do you know what she could do   to me  to zoe   i know what you say she can do   i also know we can't prove what she already did  and you can't detain people on suspicion of crimes  yet to be committed  be nice if we could   so what do i do to stop her   bring her in the right way   ah mate  mate  mate  thank you   yeah  well   it's only a gun  so tell me what i need to know   all right  so what you've got  this is a glock 26  lightweight compact pistol  weighs less than 16 ounces   carbon steel spring and barrel  polymer frame and components   polymer frame  let me see that   polymer  plastic  yeah  it's light   it's easy to carry  plastic melts   plastic melts  why am i thinking that   of course    knock knock   what   never mind  what's this  so   her parents get one shot to the head each  boom  boom   and the dog gets four  four shots spent killing the dog   why  it's a dog  it bites intruders   why the overkill  perversity  i don't know   no  no  four bullets in the dog to maximise the mess   to make the cause of death unambiguous   she needed to blow the dog's head apart to access the digestive tract   she disassembles the gun  shoves the pieces  the gloves  shell casings  down the dog's gullet   into its stomach   and then they cremate the dog   all right  it'll burn  watch  i have absolutely no doubt  look at that  it's melting   john  fine   it's not enough   the gun was in the dog   section 8  police and criminal evidence act    a magistrate may issue a warrant authorising the search of a premises provided there are reasonable grounds  for believing the location contains  it's my assessment that saying  the gun was in the dog   will not be judged by the issuing magistrate to have met those criteria   it's in there  on the mantelpiece   and even if that were true  we can't prove that alice morgan touched it  let alone fired it  we need more   we've got to trace the gun  put it in her hands  it won't be traceable   she doesn't leave evidence  just an evidence shaped absence   and after everything else  that just infuriates you  doesn't it  come on   she kills her parents and walks   she threatens zoe's life  we can't touch her  this is zoe we're talking about     john      who sat with your kids the day your father died   so take the chilly bitch down   but slow down  calm down  find another angle   there are no other angles  she left us nothing   what do you need to prove more  that alice morgan's guilty  or that you're right   john  give me your wife's address   why  i'll stay on her  make sure she's ok   you take down alice morgan   i told you  boss  the gun was in the dog   because she needs it   alice   that would be mine   hello  alice  do you know why the gun fragments in that urn  can never be used as evidence against me   one  the cremation melted away their forensic value   because those ovens burn very  very hot   two  you could never prove that i ever knew the gun was in there   let alone that i so much as touched it  and three   most dazzlingly  you broke in to my apartment and stole it   in the process you committed a crime that will cost your job  so congratulations   well done  i know that   this urn  this isn't evidence   this is what you need to remind yourself of who you really are   that's why you followed me   i know you  i see you   and you think that i'm that weak   yes  then you don't know me at all   ok   no  john  no   stay away from zoe   is this what you did to henry madsen   so  go on  kiss me  kill me   do something   here's what's going to happen   you're going to stay away from my wife   or i'm going to arrest someone else for the murder of your parents   oh  yeah  by the time he's found guilty  you'll have been forgotten about   there will be no enigma with alice morgan at the heart of it   no one will wonder how you did it  no one will think how clever you were   i'll just plant the evidence  i don't need the gun   you'd degrade the law you serve  just to protect some woman who cast you aside like offal   in a second   and you think i'm the monster   love is supposed to dignify us  exalt us   how can it be love  john  if all it does is make you lonely and corrupt   answer the question   don't turn your back on me   all right  justin  you can go home now  all right  you sure   yeah  yeah  i'm good   ok  all right  you sure  yeah   i'm very sure   go on   engine starts  doorbell buzzes  zo   buzzing continues  he'll leave  let him go   zoe  no  sod him
