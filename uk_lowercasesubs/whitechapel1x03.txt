 this is my home   my son picked up that parcel   my job to keep this stuff outside the house  not let it in the door   i let 'em down   it's mary bousfield's kidney   half of it  half  jesus   get it off my table   this letter came with the package   it's handwritten  addressed to you   i think it's safe to assume it's from the killer   what's it say  it says    mr miles  sir   i send you half the kidney i took from one woman   reserved it for you     the other piece i fried and ate  it was very nice     i may send you the bloody knife that took it out  if you only wait a while longer     catch me when you can    exactly the same as what the ripper wrote   what  i've done my research as well  you know   handwriting's unusual  the way he's shaped the letters   it's eastern european   i've done a lot of courses   a woman was murdered in one of your vans  we need to find the driver   with all due respect  mr maduro  you don't have a filing system   if you can't help we'll get the vat man   he'll have this sorted in no time  no  no  vat   not necessary   i need a secretary  but how do i ask someone to work in this place   ah   no  i have a filing system   please  let me think  mr maduro     it is coming to me  the night before last  you say   kfc   i have many drivers  all hard workers  you know   poles  albanians   you know what i'm saying   that's off the books  then  everyone wants cash  don't they   ha  kfc   ha  i told you i have system   driver's name will be in there   we're going to release buchan  no no no  charge him   how  we've no evidence of collusion  i'll think of something   we believe the killer relies on him for advice   mary kelly is his most complex murder  he'll have questions   we give him his mentor back   let him get in touch   fine  we put him on surveillance  phone rings  di chandler  i've got a name for the driver  of the van  sir  works at the hospital   have you got a pen  i'll have to spell it   'go ahead ' anthony pricha   buchan   out   am i free  yeah   i failed you all   i failed poor mary  failed the inquiry    failed all those who had faith in me   oh  shut up   dr cohen  this is ds miles  do you have a minute   yeah  but if this is about emma jones   you should talk to dr phillips  he treated her when she came in   john  this is di chandler  the detective i was telling you about   i'm afraid emma jones is still in a coma   but i'd be happy to help if i can   we're looking for a porter  anthony pricha   the morgue man  the morgue man   i'll show you where to find him   hello   great  he's not here   wait a moment   this is anthony pricha   so you're the morgue man   you must enjoy the company of the dead   the dead   i don't care  i want to sleep   'you're 23  is that right ' 'yes '   well  i don't look too good for my age   but come on  23   what the hell you been playing at  son   i lived through a war  in kosovo   yes   and i   i   i see my family killed   i see my house burned   i am shot   for them  i'm dead man   but i live   i come to england   i work  i eat   but i am dead man   you must get flashbacks  nightmares   i bet sometimes you feel like you're going to explode   so what do you do then   do you go and look for a woman   for woman  you need time  you need money   why waste time and money  eh   you can do what you like once they're dead   hmph   i don't know what you say to me   how long have you worked for ac maduro health   safety   i no work there  driving vans   for mr maduro  i do not know mr maduro   well  he knows you  he hired you   no  not me   all right  anthony  tell me about the work you do   'i work in hospital '  i work in kitchen in brick lane   sometimes i work in factory  but it's no good there i think   they do not always pay  but maduro pays  cash in hand   i do not know him  if i know him  i tell you   have you heard of jack the ripper   the experts reckon he was a foreign fella like yourself   i no work for maduro  no work for jack   there's a russian  he knows where to get jobs   but he's bad man i think   you're going to stop with all this helpless asylum seeker crap  and start answering the bloody questions   or you'll regret the day you set foot in this country   my mother is dead   my father is dead   my brother  my sisters are dead   what can you do to me   i have nothing for you to take   we need maduro to id pricha  and get past this whole pretence  of him not knowing about the van   i'll fetch him myself   mccormack  trace the parcel   see if anyone remembers pricha sending it to miles  guv   i hate witnesses  necessary evil   they're all boss eyed  with memories like goldfish   can't make a case without them   ok   take your time  look at each man carefully   when you're satisfied  tell me which man you hired  to drive for your company   uh  you made a mistake   is the wrong line up  anthony is not even there   yeah  i remember that parcel   really  well  i remember him   i knew he was up to something  you can tell  innit   ugh  didn't like him at all  he made me think of the devil   what do you mean  the devil   like an evil presence  you know  ugh   he has this parcel  and he wants to know  is first class post 100  reliable   he doesn't want his parcel to go missing   i tell him about recorded delivery  he don't want to know  i say    you've got legs   why not walk it  it's only round the corner  innit    i didn't see why he had to post it when he could have easily taken it   can you describe this man   not fat or nothing   um   staring eyes   like a wolf   he had a hat on  one of those blue felt ones with a little peak   big moustache  i thought maybe he wasn't english  but he sounded ok   and the colour of his hair  his eyes   dark  very dark  all over  you mean black   i mean his aura   so if you saw him again  would you recognise him   yes  i would  want to see him   we have cctv  i don't believe this   that's fantastic  mrs buki   i wish all witnesses were like you   no  not him   it's further on  actually   that's him   are you sure  yeah  that's who gave me the parcel   see  that moustache and the hat   stop  that's the man i hire   that's anthony   the killer stole pricha's identity  and used false documents to obtain a job at ac maduro health   safety   the anthony pricha we arrested had no idea his id had been taken   he's a genuine refugee  and has no connection to the murders   this is the man who sent half of mary bousfield's kidney to ds miles   this   is the man mr maduro hired   it's the same man   this is our killer   i know him   i mean  i've seen him before  get the mug books   find him   i've seen him  i know it  i remember those eyes  they gave me the creeps   give him some air   take your time  look at one face at a time   saw his face recently   there was a picture     i know him  i just know it  i     is that him  yeah   yeah  that's him   that's severin klosowski   hanged 1903 for poisoning his wife  oh no   abberline  the detective who chased the ripper  said he was the one   we're not getting any closer to this guy  and he knows it   sorry  sir  oh  it's all right   be on traffic tomorrow   nothing remains of no 29 hanbury street   and this is as close as we can get  to where the body of annie chapman was found in the back yard   annie chapman had three children   emily ruth  annie georgina and john   poor john was a cripple   and emily died of meningitis   annie took to drink  and her marriage fell apart    oh  get to the murder  all  yes   isn't it enough for you that the poor woman died   the new ripper's been killing them round here   why don't you take us to those murder sites   at least they exist  yeah  come on   this is a classic ripper tour   where's your decency  your compassion   what  murder is not entertainment   go home   crawl back under your rocks  show us the murder sites   no   i'm sorry   i can't do this any more   at least give us our money back  we paid our money   here  come back   'police have come under fire for being slow to react  to the spate of jack the ripper copycat murders in the east end '  'fear has gripped whitechapel   '  'it's one week since mary bousfield   a community support officer  was found murdered in mitre square   thought to be the third victim of the jack the ripper copycat   '  '  waiting game  if they are right about the theory   '  '  according to leading ripper experts   the final murder will take place on november 9 '  'all the police know is that the victim will have red hair  and the murder will be acted out in london's east end '   the ripper destroyed her face   he cut off her breasts  gutted her  and stripped the skin from her thighs     mary's heart was cut out and never found    '  police are now   ' '  happen anywhere   and police are no nearer to pinpointing where '   all we know is this     mary kelly had long red hair   and her last meal consisted of fish and potatoes    'public concern focuses on the lack of perceived police presence  in the east end   ' 'police are under enormous pressure  to catch the killer before he strikes again   '  where's mccormack   interviewing his third ripper of the day   all the loonies are confessing  i know   sanders is on the buchan shift   everyone else is out interviewing mary bousfield's friends   the di seems to be living here  d'you think he's all right   no   i know what you need   you got to eat   you got to focus  you got to eat   what  you got no appetite   we've got two days until he copies the murder of mary kelly   i've been out all night  retracing his steps   over and over  trying to work out how he's going to do it   well  this murder could happen anywhere  in any flat   she was torn apart  he completely     he completely ripped her to pieces   you were right about me  all pr and paperwork   i can't hide it any more  i'm   i'm not up to it   i don't think there's one of us that finds it easy   when we're at the scene  we get on with it   there's a process  we're trained   but once we're on our own  it's different   mccormack dreams of his perfect pub   sanders takes his kids out   he thinks we don't know  but kent has a little cry  in the bogs or the car park   you say you're not up to it  being up to it  has got nothing to do with the dead   being up to it's turning up next morning at 9 00am no matter what   so eat up  sir   what about you  what do you do   when i get home i go straight down to my garden   to my pond   i've got a nice bit of seating there  away from the house   a bit of privacy   and i feed my fish   i got carp  real beauties   they come up  take the food out of my hand   them fish save me  my job  my marriage   you want to get yourself some fish   better than crying in car parks   thank you all for coming   glad you made it  sir  for some time     thought you should see this  what's happening   as the world's premier expert     it's not a ripper tour  it's something else   many of you have read my best selling book  like other authorities on jack  i have long believed  that mary kelly was the last victim of the ripper   well   i was wrong   i would like it to be known that in my expert opinion   mary kelly was not murdered by the ripper   kelly was murdered in her lodgings on her bed   but jack always killed in the street   mary was torn to pieces in a frenzy   but jack always had an objective and he was controlled   i believe catherine eddowes was jack's last victim   here in mitre square   after her  there were no more ripper killings   do you truly believe that   i'm prepared to destroy my life's work and start again   such is the force of my conviction   he's lost the plot   no  i know what he's doing   are you going to be ok  mm   that's all i could think of to stop him   it's not much  but it's all i've got   there's still your inquiry  though   well  nobody else wants my job   they just want to stand back and watch me go down in flames   tell me  joe  who do you think was jack the ripper   what does it matter  i'm serious   if you can't decide who the ripper is   how will you catch your killer  it's completely irrelevant   well  the killer's decided who the ripper was   you've got to see things through his eyes   this is your last chance   who killed mary kelly   i've done all i can  joe   it's down to you now   oh  lovely  oh  look at that  it's a board game   it's like a game  and helpful to the inquiry   we'll play it  happy birthday  skip   i'll get it  hey  give him a beer   joe  lovely  come in   did you come on your own  yeah   happy birthday  thanks   well  you could have brought a friend   or a   partner   you think i'm gay  wouldn't matter if you were   i'm not gay   no  well  no one is on the job  obviously   but don't you worry  my boys are above all that   i appreciate your openness and inclusivity   come and have a drink  and thanks for the fish food  very thoughtful   he's obviously covering his tracks  buchan's trying to prevent a murder  by convincing the killer mary kelly never happened   you can't change history  he's trying to save a life   you should have seen him burning his books  he was gutted   you may have to change your mind about buchan   irritating  interfering  pompous    i thought you'd appreciate the importance of a man's reputation   and what it costs him when he loses it   buchan's destroyed a name he took 20 years to build  that means something   yeah  all right   maybe he didn't know who he was talking to on the website   he's an unwitting accomplice  yeah  all right   so if buchan doesn't lead to the killer       where does that leave us   i mean  the next killing's tomorrow night   i'm going to check on my fish   beer  oh  cheers   cheers   if you'd been a copper back then   if you were abberline   who would you fancy for the ripper   yeah  i've thought about that a lot  yeah  me too   what if the original jack was also wearing disguises   what if jack was a woman   a crazed abortionist  stealing uteruses   yeah  that's likely  nurses make great serial killers   jill the ripper    can't have kids herself  so she steals women's wombs   stops them from having what she can't have   no  women poison  or they shoot   their victims are usually the very young or the very old   all right then  whodunit   well  i think jack would have been in his thirties   he was local  lived alone   probably in the area where the murderers took place   he was a labourer  shabbily dressed   well known to the prostitutes  who trusted him   he knew two victims quite well  catherine eddowes and mary kelly   since he mutilated their faces  ok  you've given me a profile   so now give me a name   george hutchinson   a witness saw him with mary kelly before she died   after that witness gave her statement  hutchinson gave another   saying he'd seen her going off with another man   hutchinson's statement was incredibly detailed   even down to the man's horseshoe shaped tiepin   and we know what witnesses are like  no memory  and boss eyed   he talked about the colour of the man's spats   the fact that he was carrying a parcel covered in american cloth   he remembered brown kid gloves    all at 2 00am  by an unlit passageway  please   he invented that man  without question   to avoid being the last person to see mary kelly alive   was hutchinson ever a suspect  no   the police believed his story about a posh man in an astrakhan coat   they went looking for somebody quite unlike hutchinson   i still prefer my mad bird theory   fire investigation have identified the accelerants  used in the wilkes st fire  they took their bloody time   benzoin  phenyl  collodion  that mean anything to you   maduro had them in his vans  come on   where to  maduro's  no  wilkes street   i think the killer set fire to this building  the night of the first murder  to set the right historical atmosphere   but he had no blueprints to work from  no coroner's report   he was improvising   so he might have made a mistake   it says here there were three seats of fire   there   there       and over there   he knew what he was doing  then  no  just the opposite   a professional arsonist would set one blaze  and completely gut the building   this guy didn't trust his tools  he went belt and braces   he set too many fires  which ate up all the oxygen in the room       and stopped the fire from spreading   the killer stopped e mailing buchan after the first murder  didn't he   yeah  the same night as the fire   well  i think i know why  then   could be the killer's computer   get this examined straight away   miles  we think we found the killer's computer   at wilkes st  'that's great  boss '  so are you coming in  'no  i've something i need to do '  george hutchinson lived in the victoria working men's home   at the epicenter of where the murders took place   it's a block of flats now  i'm going to knock on a few doors   call it my eureka moment  he's had a eureka moment   don't go in without backup  it's a rough estate   i'll be fine  mother   we'd better go and hold his hand   yeah  man  who that  it's me  mate  innit   excuse me  hello   hello  can i   i was wondering    excuse me  thanks for stopping   could i ask some questions about some of your neighbours   i'm down on whores  and i shan't quit rippin' 'em  till i do   get   buckled   hm  what did you say   ahh  ohh     oh  my god   sir  you've got a head injury  you need to go to hospital   i'm not going anywhere  you're as pretty as me now   not quite  i didn't hit every step on the way down   you ready  sir   do it   bloody hell   miles  in here   jesus  mary and joseph   bloody hell  sir   there's more   i can't believe this   oh  my god   bloody hell   it's the leather apron   ugh     i want socos in here now  we need to go through every inch of this place   it's all here  every last detail   is there anything about mary kelly   nothing we don't know  she lived in miller's court with a joe barnet   her last meal was fish and potatoes  that's really going to help   miller's court's over the road  not now  it's a car park   well  what do you want me to say   all we know is he's going to rip her apart in her flat   on her bed  and recreate what happened    the victim will have long red hair   yeah   well  i think i've found her   i've seen her before  she's a nurse from the hospital   get her id'd and under protection  go  now   mccormack  go with him   there must be something amongst all this that tells us who the guy is   excuse me  love   excuse me  do you know this woman  i need to find her   tv  '  physician  aesclepius   who enraged the gods by bringing a dead man back to life '  'as punishment for this manmade miracle   zeus killed aesclepius       but from respect for his ability   placed the dead physician's soul amongst the stars   '  oh  this is a nightmare  there are dozens of birth certificates   one of them must be his  i don't recognise any names   yeah  kent   her name is frances coles  she's a midwife   they've id'd her  frances coles  a midwife   have they made contact  have you made contact   'she's not answering ' he can't get her on the phone   'her address is clerkenwell rd   '  they've got an address  send a tactical unit  get tactical   we'll meet you there  no  we need to find him   the answer must be here somewhere   the last murder will be tonight  something must point to who he is   these are obviously false identities   i think the real man disappeared years ago  and we're left with this   as far as we're concerned  he's an unidentified person  a john doe   john doe  oh my god   you know what the police called a john doe of jewish origin in 1888   what  david cohen   who's david cohen  dr david cohen   we can postpone if you like  no  don't be silly  come in   sit down  make yourself at home   i don't want to be alone tonight  anyway   where's john  couldn't get away from a e   ah  typical  he said to say sorry   he wanted me to really look after you   i really hope you like fish pie   mm  i love it   yeah  we're just about to go in now  sir   they're going in   that was

kent   got an address book  sir  an address book   no  somerford st   no  no  no  nearer   how about leonard st  leonard st  it's miles away   nearer than that  hutchinson lived a stone's throw from mary kelly   the address must be a street away  'like wentworth st '  wentworth or dawes st  it's as near as that   come on  we're running out of time   if we get this wrong  she's dead   i've got one  got one  hang on a sec   it's bethnal green  sorry   come here  you bitch   i've found one  could be a boyfriend  really close   a man called john phillips   flower and dean st  flower and dean  spot

respect  sir  i saved two lives   that lunatic is still free  how long till he kills again   what atrocities are still to come   he won't kill again  why should he stop   we don't even know who he is   we know nothing about his real identity   another chance to kill a mary kelly   he's failed  nothing left to live for   he'll want to die and preserve his anonymity   he wants to be a myth  like the first jack   i think if we monitor suicides in the capital over the next two weeks   he'll turn up  well  it's not your call any more   you could have been great  we had such ambition for you   but now       i'm going to have to cut you loose   nothing but a di   thank you   your mother said i'd find you here   hello  joe   how are you  ed   i have to know   you looked into his eyes   what was he like   he was just a man   and i'm always amazed at the evil men do   will you drink to her   yes  of course   to you  mary   what will you do now   oh  my investigating days are not over   wherever there's a mystery  the unexplained   the whiff of conspiracy  i'll be there   i'm you're the right man for the job   join me  we'd make a great team   boss   we gotta go   would you like a lift  no  no no   you're very kind  but i prefer the bus   you see all of human life that way   it's not all serial killers and car chases  and saving the girl  you know  i know that   gangland murder  drug related  domestic  aggravated burglary   knock on the head for no reason on a friday night   whitechapel   you up for that  i'm here  aren't i   two tea bags and milk  skip  green tea  sir   want a biscuit   they're wholemeal  help you think   ah  ha  all right  what have we got   stab wound to the chest  looks like a mugging gone bad   it might be  perhaps the killer wants us to dismiss it as a random attack   so we don't dig any deeper  oh  don't start   don't you have a nice desk to go to   no  i don't  let's go   i mean  with the greatest respect   nine times out of ten  if it looks like a mugging  it's a mugging   and if it looks like a domestic  it's a domestic   but it wasn't last time  was it  no  fair enough   but the exception proves the rule  and if this is an exception   transcript chocolate sync innuit
