silva's address book   lots of names  lots of first names   most of them are friends  relatives  gardeners  plumbers   that sort of thing   i know it's a tall order  but it would be nice to find him   at the risk of repeating myself  why     why not    is this any of your business   there are other things we can be doing   are we throwing good money after bad   my money  john  don't worry about it   fair enough  i'm only thinking of my christmas bonus     two wrongs don't make a right    have you got something to say   it was poor judgment last night and it's poor judgment now   you think my poor judgment last night led to him kicking the shit out of his wife     is that what you're saying    she didn't say that     i'm only asking a question    it didn't help     why don't you say what you mean    it didn't help   it may have contributed  it may not have done   but i think it was a really stupid thing to do   i want the bastard found   you're the boss   what's the alternative to looking for him   not looking for him   that's right  walking away  well  i can't do that   i can't because of what happened last night   because of my part in what happened last night   i can't do it  i can't just walk away     vince    what   cathy   are we even now  i broke down your door  you broke down mine   did i  when was this   is this where it stops  can we begin to behave like adults

it's a fine line  ain't it   i want to talk about a settlement on the flat   put it in a letter  i can rip that up   it's half mine  i'm entitled   look  i seem to remember that you said it could be mine   you were crying  you had streaky mascara   you said you still loved me   i mean  was that a lie  cath   which bit   i don't expect you to sell it   you can just get a valuation   when was it you left me  three weeks ago   maybe we should take the valuation from a month ago   if you want  yeah   i mean  spiritually you left six months before that   i mean  you just don't end a relationship on the spur of the moment  do you   you think about it   i mean  you lay in your bed at night  listening to the wanker next to you snoring  and you think about leaving him   so we should take the valuation from then  from that moment   i don't want to fight about this   i'm just trying to establish when the flat stopped being our own   is that fair enough  is that our datum   i mean  when was it   i tell you what i'll do  i'll take it from the first time you shagged driscoll   fair enough     i was really hoping you wouldn't be like this    like what   inquisitive  pissed off  what would you expect     you're shouting    i'm not shouting   this is shouting   i mean  there is a major difference  between this and shouting   there is more poxy volume   is he throwing things yet   i wish he'd throw her  out of the office on her frigging head     ear    arse   whatever   keep away from the house  please   far as the flat's concerned  i'll put it in a letter   do you love him   yes   you paused   i was deciding whether it was any of your business   goodbye  vincent   gillian   apparently you still want me   nice to see i haven't lost it   good picture   oh  for god's sake     gillian  don't worry  we'll sort it out  gillian   right  have we found gary de silva yet     i'd rather look after our own  vince    our naked own   hey  she's upset   yeah  i'm sorry   sorry   um    well  i'll talk to her   i'll do it now  all right   gill     gillian    i'm all right   no   i don't think either of us are  are we   eh   shall we compare notes   this thing with your phone is

one week  lucky girl  eh   this friend  is he a good friend   kieron maguire his name is   a mate of andrew's really  my ex   do you think it's him   why   i think he used me   i think    he knew i liked him  and he used me   why would he do that   why would he do that  gillian   to help andrew  andrew wants justine   i'm sorry     come on  come on   you don't need to be sorry  you haven't done anything  have you   no   it's always the same old story  isn't it  eh   i finally get the girl  and the phone goes   yeah  vincent   i um     i want to send her some flowers   wold yo take them in

what attracted me to him in the first place   what did you do when it arrived on your phone  the picture   being a red blooded male  i panicked   i thought  oh no  i'm irresistible   do i keep my vest on  or leave it off   have you erased it   no  not yet  no  it's evidence   but you will  though  won't you   oh  yeah   eventually   my name is kieron magire   i admit to taking phone pictres of gillian lafferty   i admit to passing them on to andrew mccormack  in the knowledge that he intended to send them to gillian's friends   how   by tapping into her mobile phone   he's got a mate who works for the network and he can get into anyone's accont  and send messages from that nmber   makes it look like that person sent them   good boy  last bit   andrew  they want yo to call gillian or this tape goes to the police   good   not bad   it's the food of love  did yo know that     what  omelette is    yeah   this morning it was cornflakes   yeah  them as well   so the private dick's still being his unco operative self again  then   i still think we should bill him for that door  you know   it was our fault  we started it   we didn't have an option  we coldn't help orselves   do yo think he walked arond the hose   i don't know   creepy if he did   piss off   i don't want to talk about him   all right  beth   hey  i'm at the hospital with a girl called marianne   says she's sarah's best friend   i don't know  maybe gary could turn up   if he does  beth  give him a wide berth and call me   yeah  ok   no  i mean it  stay away from him   how is she   yeah  so so     what's

the kitchen   behind the curtains in the dining room  i'm so sorry   tell me there are none in the bedroom   nearly  but no   i just    i just want to know why you left   i just want to know why   i left you because i love him and he loves me   and i know that because we talk and we listen   which is something surprisingly that you never did   say goodbye  vincent   good night  catherine   yeah   i thought you were ignoring me  he's got the tape  and i'm hungry   shall we force the issue   gillian  wait round the corner   who is it   fella who sent the tape  i need an answer   i spoke to kieron  it was made under duress   he denies every single word   gillian says she wants you to stop being an arsehole   tell her to piss off   and she doesn't want the police involved   neither do i  so you know what i'm going to do   i'm going to get one of my team to follow you  and document your every waking minute on film   tell her i want to see my daughter   well  sending near pornographic photos of your daughter's mother  is hardly the right way to go about it  is it   is that the sort of story you want your daughter to hear   just tell her   and can i also tell her you'll stop sending the pictures   can i tell her you'll stop hijacking her phone   if she lets me see justine   once  twice  what   no  regularly  ongoing   you promise you'll stop sending the pictures   if she lets me
