 here are your brother's things  sign here  mr kingdom   the sea always gives up its dead   thanks  neil     all right  ted    all right  beautiful morning  sidney   over the azores     again  how many times do you want me to sue the planning authority  mr snell   they can't build a car park there  it's not right   from memory  this'll be the 17th time  you've brought an action on the same issue     eighteenth    eighteenth  oh  forgive me   one of them must have slipped through my synapses     but they're wrong    well  they may well be wrong  mr snell   and i sympathise  but they have the law on their side   they've been through all the usual rigorous procedures   as i recall  you appealed  it went through three separate courts of inquiry  and all the way up to the secretary of state for the environment   all of whom  at some point  you tried to sue or legally challenge   you even tried to sue the barristers i engaged to argue your case in court   they gave me the wrong advice   no  mr snell  i gave you the advice and it remains the same  drop it   ah  but i've been doing some research    just leave them down there  will you  mr snell   i'll pick them up and go through them later   oh  and i'll need legal aid     why can't he wash    i think he does  it's his clothes   over the years they've become impregnated with his unique signature   he means well   where would the world be without people like snell   a lot fresher   it's not entirely his fault   millie's new charcoal diet isn't helping     morning    now  sort  read  inwardly digest   and bring your sharp legal mind to bear on whether there's a case    against the planning authorities    i've got my own case   market shipborough's very own jarndyce v jarndyce     snell versus everybody else    this came for simon   just file it with the others  would you   don't suppose there was anything from the bank  was there   no     i picked these up yesterday    would you like me to     no  i'll have to go through them  the police will probably want them back     you all right    me  gosh  yes  yes   never been all righter     cheers   an hour and a half  do i look 60   not yet  ask me again at midnight   ninety minutes left of living and then it's downhill all the way   sheila   sheila     peter kingdom   oh  no  when   peter  lyle   lyle  lyle     sheila larsen  larsen with an  en     ah  here we are   last will and testament  dated a year ago  how did she     you screamed   i bellowed manfully  you'll know when i scream  probate   a heart attack  they think  possibly a stroke   but i'm on planning   and there you were thinking nothing ever happens in market shipborough   no  what i said was  it's not quite london   well  maybe  but we have our prominent citizens   should you stay on after your articles   and should life sadly run its course for some of our clients   i can promise you the estates of two television presenters   a thrash metal drummer  and an actor who played a sex offender in the bill   can london boast that  i think not   no  millie  this is business   i'll take this puppy   peter  oh  i understand that next to the lure of london's bright lights   market shipborough must seem like a very dozy east anglian backwater   point is  here you belong   practising law in london is like    light beer   it may look like law and smell like law  but when you swig it right down   it doesn't have the same effect  here it's more human  morning  jim   you know everyone  everyone knows you  john  sorry   you make a difference  that's the point  hmm   parking's just as crap  though   lyle  wow  now those are cars   sunglasses  lyle  you're a solicitor  not a hitman   damien  peter kingdom   this is my articled clerk  lyle anderson   gosh  last time i saw you  you were  what   seven   during mum and dad's divorce  he bought me a football   did i  i'm afraid that is the devil of being a lawyer   we're only ever around during a crisis   i'm so sorry about your mother  she was such a life force    well  it was to her   it's probably a good thing  she hated getting old  so       shall we go through    mmm   so  who found her   some bloke called rupert  you heard of him   i didn't catch his surname   rupert  no  i think i'd remember a rupert   oh  right  so he's not in the will  then   not as far as i'm aware  no   i checked the wardrobes upstairs  he certainly wasn't living with her   last thing we need is some leech of a boyfriend  crawling out of the woodwork and spoiling the inheritance   well  quite     sorry   to be honest  i just want this whole thing wrapped up as soon as possible   i can't be schlepping up here all hours   well  i'll certainly bear your request in mind   but you should remember that our client is your mother's estate  not you   our job is to gather in the assets  pay the debts   and then distribute the residue amongst the beneficiaries   just pull your finger out  will you  and don't rack up the fees    then we can get this thing done and dusted   what's your brother make of all this   he does know your mother's dead   i mean  what a tosser  why should we help him   tosser or not  we're not working for him   we're working for his mother  death  especially sudden death   often leaves a great deal unsaid and a whole heap of unanswered questions   without us  many families would tear themselves to pieces   ah  here we are  the other son  mark larsen     you can manage on your own  can't you    are you having a laugh   only i have to find somewhere to park   mind you  you should find it a doddle without this to carry   oh  lord     has she gone    who     mrs thing    where   oh  never mind     is mr kingdom in    no  i'm afraid he isn't  mrs     well    he's out   look  i don't know how long it is since you two haven't spoken   or what the reason is  but it ends here  do you understand   decisions are gonna have to be taken  which need the pair of you to be on speaking terms     it wasn't me  it was him    oh  great start  thank you     we're different people  mr kingdom    no  you're different   oh  is that right   well  look at me and tell me you haven't already been through mum's stuff  and picked out the best bits for yourself     why would i do that    i don't know why  you just do   do you have a brother  mr kingdom   my position isn't relevant  look  it's very simple   after a few donations  the residue of your mother's estate  is split between the pair of you  all right   but she specifically wanted this dealt with first   the contents to be shared between you     these yours    i don't think so     well  she wanted you both to have them    well  they're crap   hang on  they're not some modern artist  are they   you know  tracey whatever  or damien thingy  are they   emphatically not     then what the hell's she playing at    perhaps she thought you'd like them   well  she was wrong   please  just sort out the money   sorry     i'm glad mum chose you    thank you  thank you very much   well  we'll try not to let her down     beatrice    anywhere here's fine  have you got  20    what are you doing here   staying  not for long   couldn't stand it any longer  so i checked myself out   do you have anyone that could help me with these  ooh  perfect   anyone making tea  hello  millie   wow     you can't    well  she's    she's my sister       mr kingdom    yes   rupert bennett  i was with sheila larsen and i come about money   oh  well    rupert bennett   i'm afraid there's no provision for a rupert bennett in the will   oh  no  i'm not after that type of money  i'm a male escort   she hired me to sleep with her for the night  this is my invoice     i always liked this room    yes  well  don't go getting ideas   last night was a purely temporary measure     where did you sleep    sofa     why    why  because the floor is uncomfortable  and millie hogged the basket   does gary know you're here   course not  what's it got to do with him if i want to discharge myself   well  it is usually a joint decision  isn't it   it's a private clinic  i can make up my own mind   anyway  you know how i hate it when people get clingy   you didn't sleep with him  tell me you didn't sleep with your doctor   why is it all my fault  he slept with me  too   sugar   with the light behind you  you could've been simon   i don't think so   no  of course not  you're much too awkward    not so much milk  either    what are you gonna do with her   well  maybe     bugger   lyle  great  everyone else i qualified with is in and out of the high courts   me  i move your old toys round market shipborough   well  that's because they made the mistake of getting good degrees  from well regarded universities   your genius  lyle  was to avoid such an obvious route to legal stardom   no other candidate i interviewed  chose his uni on the basis of there being a snooker room  in every hall of residence   the essential quality for success is to be yourself and you  lyle   have mastered the art of yourself ness to a higher degree than     well  to a higher degree than you managed to get in your finals   if i can put it that way   have you got a screwdriver   thank you   just shove them down there  i'll deal with them later       uh  sheila larsen  according to the bank statements   has been using this rupert guy  about twice a month for the past six years   yes  well  sadly  rupert is gonna have to wait in the queue for his money  like everybody else   pop quiz  lyle  order of distribution of estates   mortgages first  and then funeral and our expenses   exactly   one reason why being a solicitor is more rewarding than soliciting     next    inland revenue and customs and excise   yes  after which rupert and others can present their bills  for services rendered  and then   specific legacies and finally  residues to the boys   excellent   yes  banks  funeral directors  tax collectors  lawyers and whores  all come before family in the eyes of probate law  it's interesting  isn't it   she was using this rupert for six years  which is exactly the length of time  her sons haven't been on speaking terms   families are weird     she's still growling at me   yes  yes  they are weird  aren't they   off you pop back to the larsens  see what you can find     oi   oh  hey  now then  you can't do this   i'm with kingdom solicitors  we're the executors of her estate   peter   problem  you'd better come over   the cars weren't hers  they were leased   a bit heavy handed to grab them back when she only just died  isn't it   no  she was behind with her payments  they sent her letters   the fact that she died was just a coincidence really   they were gonna take them back anyway   and i found all these under the spare bed   doesn't look like she opened her post for months   oh  credit cards  february  right up to the limit    well  looks like there's a lot of work to be done  doesn't it     is there some sort of leak    might be  yes     mr kingdom    oh  mr snell  what a pleasant surprise   i was wondering how the case was going   oh  oh  really very well  very good indeed  yes   what do you think of what i turned up     uh  turned up  remind me    in the papers   oh  well  in fact  i was so intrigued   i gave them to my young associate here  mr anderson  for a second opinion   oh  so you think we've got a chance  then     only we've gotta stop them    well  it's something we must discuss   it's very complex  there's lots of latin   oh  i know  so you'll ring me and let me know when to come in   well  yes  only perhaps not so much in as in the open air  yeah     oh  you do that  do you    oh  yes   yes  we lawyers are much more outdoors these days   the stuffy days of the stuffy solicitor in his stuffy office are long gone   yeah   i'll deal with all those  you plough straight into snell's papers   the quicker he realises he has no case  the quicker we get rid of him   and the quicker this town gets its much needed bloody car park built   peter   i don't mind the company  it's the staring i draw the line at     staring    it's not a lounge     i'm not a television  i have to work    i'll have a word with her     no  you won't    i will   i know you   she's all you've got   i've no idea who she is  where did you find her   in simon's wallet  so he  um    he never mentioned her    well  you know simon   he never talked  though i'm sure he had more than his fair share of girls   take it from me  i'm a woman  i know these things   do you think they'll ever find his body   well  after six months it seems unlikely   well  i'm just pleased your father wasn't here to have to deal with it   he had a hard enough time with beatrice  do you visit her     which institution is she in now    my institution   is that wise     it's just the way it is  you know    you are good  peter   everything always falls on your shoulders  doesn't it   when your father had alzheimer's  beatrice  simon     how long before he's officially declared dead   six and a half years   hard to think you're now my only nephew   mmm   is it that time already  oh  my     peter  walk me to the dining room    of course   okay     have you heard of dogging    um  yes  aunt auriel  i have   really  oh  oh  it was news to me   difficult enough to do it in a car at all   without the heavy breathing brigade staring in at you   the old rover had bench seats in the front   you're a wicked and insane old woman  auriel     why don't you stay for some soup    um  yes  yes  why not  absolutely     i'd rather you didn't do that    do what   hey  do you mind   you can have them back  i just want some copies first   she's stolen my keys  i'm not putting up with this  peter   i'm not some football to be kicked around   no  you're right   you've also had a fax from the land registry  about the charges on sheila larsen's house   that should cheer you up     are they sure    that's what it says     who am i to doubt    you're not gonna believe this     snell has got a case    what   he's got grounds for appealing against the planning decision   no  no  that's impossible   oh  god   can gloria have her keys back   she had to break into her own house tonight   at least she has a house  never owned anything     never been allowed    beatrice   so which room's going to be mine   oh  it'll need redecorating   but i    i thought you weren't staying long   well  i have a right to be comfortable  and i want my own entrance     beatrice  i can't do that    course you can   one of those big metal staircases up the outside   no  this is a listed property   the internal and external features have to be in keeping     in keeping with what  that's absurd    well  it's the law   well  whoever said that the law is an ass was right   well  it may well be an ass  but it's a stubborn one   and  i may point out  it's also an ass that keeps you in vodka and high heels   what is it you want from me  what are you after   you want me to be grateful  is that it  grateful that you're my brother   peter  is that better  hello  oh  hell  blast  pants and damnation   it's the only place you can get what passes for a phone signal  in market shipborough   mr snell successfully contested the building of a phone mast   mind you  wonderful view   i reckon in our time we've done the conveyancing  for just about every building as far as the eye can see   ah  so there's no doubt  then   what i just don't get is why you sold the cars   did it not occur to you that maybe we might like them   certainly more of an inheritance than finger paintings   yes  but i didn't sell them  they were taken back     back  what do you mean  back    well  she didn't own them   they were leased   rubbish  what would she do that for  she had loads of money   oh  for once in your life would you just be quiet   oh  oh  it does speak   how well do you think you knew your mother    what sort of dumb question is that   as well as any child knows their parent   did she give you any money during her lifetime  any gifts   no  not to me     well  i got a tie for my last birthday    no  i mean large financial gifts   she said she'd give everything to us once she's gone   look  when can we get probate so we can have the house   well  you see  that's the trouble  she didn't own the house   what   she took out a mortgage on the property and then last year   she took out a second one  so now the banks own most of the house  and in return she got a large sum of money in cash   thank god for that  had me worried for a minute there   yes  but the problem is  we can't find any trace of the money   well  what are you saying   i'm saying that the best part of  1 000 000 has disappeared   just doesn't make sense   i mean  if you had that kind of money lying around somewhere  hidden   why would you be up to the limit on your credit cards   paying extortionate interest   and only repaying the minimum every month   if you gave away that sort of money  who would know about it   you should ask ted  he knows everything   oh  we get them in all the time   especially now we've started doing thai food   see this one  brenda  husband left her for a younger model three year ago   financially  never been more secure  emotionally  complete wreck   was she a friend of sheila's   oh  yeah  everyone was a friend of sheila   if that jacuzzi of hers could talk  make your hair curl   you never get an invite   once  but there was a documentary on mudskippers i had to watch   really   am i the only one who never got an invite   too late now   so  did sheila throw her money around   if she did  then like the rest of her   she never threw it in this direction  look at this   there  that's what she died owing me   good lord   that's the gross national product of a small african nation   never knew her pay cash  occasionally she'd settle a bit on it   so you never saw her with large sums of money   if i had  i'd have wrestled it from her   funny  though  i always got a feeling something sad there  behind her eyes   don't think she's that happy about one of her boys    i can't believe i never got an invitation     ah  just the man i wanted to see    yeah  but not now  i'm    i'm working     come round tomorrow    oh  right  yes     usual  please  ted    two banana daiquiris  umbrellas     one with  one without    right o   nice lad   with him you don't have the worry about the humiliation of rejection     hello  is that    does peter know    well  he will when he gets home   and don't think of telling him   despite what you must have heard about me  i can make my own decisions   i'm not a little girl  i don't need his approval   no  i'm sure you don't   if i want to redecorate  that's exactly what i'll do   i live here  too  now     can i help you    well  i'm not sure   i was given this address as belonging to a mr rupert bennett   rupert  what's your name     peter kingdom    a peter kingdom for you     come in    thank you   he's only just got up  he was working last night   really     you all right    um  yes     you want some tea    no  thanks  i've just had some     have you brought me my money    sadly  no   ah  it's all right  suzie knows what i do     there's no secrets here    ah   well  um  it seems that sheila larsen got rid of a great deal of money  before she died   what  and you think i took it   no  i just wondered if you had any ideas     you think i blackmailed her    no  no  i was wondering if     if she'd mentioned anything to you     what  pillow talk    lf you like   well  the only time sheila and i mentioned money  was on the first night she hired me     did she seem worried about money    no  she drank   yes  but she didn't drink that much money   ted mentioned that sheila seemed sad   look  i'm in a sad business  everyone who hires me is sad   but i did once find her crying   it upset her that her two sons weren't speaking   i remember her saying  when everything else is gone   family's all you've got left     yes    she wasn't wrong   you don't think he could be lying  he is a gigolo   what a sweetly old fashioned word  no  no  i believe him  lyle  lyle     any news on the pension fund front    nothing   she didn't take out any life policies  either  in fact  she cashed two in   what on earth has she done with it all  and that would be who exactly     ah  yes  i was gonna tell you    oh  god  what colour has she chosen   black  a very black black   oh  and i set up that meeting with you and mr snell     with me    well  i'm far too busy   now  they plan to build the new supermarket over there   with car parking for 200 cars over there   and here's where the service road'll be   so which part is the area of contention exactly   here  according to the plans  all this is owned by the council     but it isn't    it isn't   no  they don't own this bit     well  who does    i do   you see  originally  all this was land as owned by the nursery  and they tried to sell it off in the 1930s   hence honeysuckle lane and rose bush gardens   are you all right  mr kingdom     mrs thing    who  oh  right  anyway     now  you see that this is the designated land  sold all like little boxes   but the boxes never quite met   so there's a patch of land they never bought   yes  but on the original planning application     ah  so they only assumed they owned it   so i went back to the family who originally owned it   tracked through the successors in title  and bought it     how much for     10   mr snell  you're an aggravating nuisance   a tiresome pedant and a complete genius   that land cannot be developed without your permission   i know   though god knows what we'll do for parking now   she'd done it before we could stop her     i'll speak to her    well  do this time   she's a strong woman  your sister     you were right  snell has got a case    well  i'm very rarely wrong   but how's the sheila larsen estate adding up   not quite so well   mmm   20 000 to a care home         hey  come back   oh  it's you       you are still taking your medication    of course  i'm not stupid   anyway  i don't get as violent as i used to   good   try not to drink too much when you're on it     it's not a good combination    you won't make me go back  will you   if you do  i might have to report gary to the general medical council   thank you   it seems to be my vocation  getting people out of trouble     do you miss him    simon   every day   and every day not knowing just makes it worse   i don't know how you have the time to think about so many other people   look at you  wrapped in your shell with your suit and your ties   and your eternally irritating politeness  what is it   protection     or for keeping everybody out    you tell me     do people take advantage of you    i don't think so     only you    yeah  but i'm family    i wouldn't have thought she had 20 000 left to give     oh  so you knew her quite well  then    very well  mr kingdom   i knew her for over 30 years  i think i knew her better than anybody   well  why  then  would you say that you would've thought  she didn't have 20 000 left   everyone else i spoke to  including her children   seemed to think she was rather well off     was there anything else in the will    such as   was she specific about any other arrangements   i'm not sure i follow   oh  i suppose she never thought it would happen   i have to show you something   your eyes are younger than mine  is this a  d  or a  g    it's a  k    hello  sorry  can't hear you   i'm sorry  but i really am powerless to help   although my brother's dead  he isn't  not legally at any rate   in effect  my brother's affairs are frozen  in limbo   no longer in this world  but not yet in the next     sorry i couldn't be more help    fax just came through     family records office    lyle  you'd be wasted in london   sheila larsen  is it    if only people didn't keep secrets   life would be so much simpler  wouldn't it     what do you think    well  personally i don't like you     but professionally  you're a client    i was talking about the car   peter  hello   so  are we in for a colouring set or have you found the missing money     uh  yes  yes  i have    ah   you may find the news disappointing   on the face of it  your mother was a pretty wealthy woman   but i'm afraid the reality was very different   her major asset  the house  was doubly mortgaged   she was overdrawn at the bank  and her credit card and other debts  amount to a considerable sum   the problem facing the pair of you is the way wills are commonly executed   only after the discharge of debt and specific bequests  does the residue of the estate fall to you   and i'm afraid after the mortgages have been paid  and other debts discharged  that you're left with nothing     precisely zero    no   no  that's    that's    it's not true   i'm afraid it is   i've just bought a bloody porsche   i borrowed against what i was gonna inherit     idiot    that's great  isn't it  eh   huge house  pool  jacuzzi  sports cars  expensive gigolo   what do we get  crayon pictures of trees and sky     love you  too  mum    shut up  it was hers     she could do what she wants with it    yeah  well  hasn't she just   so what did she do with all the money   i mean  can we  you know  sue to get it back   maybe she wasn't quite  you know  right in the head or     oh  i think she was  no  in my view  she did it on purpose   i think she wanted to leave you something  a little bit more valuable than money   i'll drive  uh  you may have to take the porsche back   damien  how come you can afford one of these and i can't   peter  i know  the world is so unfair  isn't it   well  what the hell are we doing here   ah  damien and mark  i've heard so much about you   your mother was such a wonderful woman  it's a tragedy she's no longer here   you must have been so proud of her   uh  yeah  yeah  we were  are   i'm sorry  mrs ashworth   but we really have no idea why we're here   but     i understand   well  seems none of us knew sheila as well as we thought we did   well  this way   thirty years ago  this was a small  run down rectory  that struggled to provide a home for children with severe special needs   and your mother changed all that   this is what your mother did for us   she donated money when she was with your father   but after she was divorced  we were able to build all this     did you know anything about this    no   our mother  are you sure   her money paid for this  what the hell for     is this where the pictures came from    certainly is   and they were all painted by the same person   karen larsen   she wanted us to name it after your sister   sister  we haven't got a sister   karen  this is damien and mark   hello   hi  karen   you making sandwiches     hands    oh  right
