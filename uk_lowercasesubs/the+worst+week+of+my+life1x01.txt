haven't    where is it     back at the office    at the office  where     just  you know  i left it in my desk    you left it lying around your desk   initially  yes  then i thought   that's a stupid idea    so i put it in the safe     you've got a safe in your office    yes  we have and it's perfectly safe     in the safe    i told you to bring it with you   i know  i know  i'm sorry  i just forgot   i phoned you twice to remind you   you're getting a bit close to the lorry   granny will be disappointed   very close  very close indeed now  it's a very large  very articulated lorry       yeah  and you        are we in a hurry  darling    yes  i said we'd be there by six   mum wants to get on with dinner  so she can do the seating plan   oh  fine  did she say what she was cooking     stew  i think    ah  which one   i don't know   the brown one  or the green one     i think she said it was lamb goulash    the brown one   apparently  you told her it was your favourite  the best meal you'd ever had   mum   how's my favourite mother in law to be   sit down  look  see  far too wide  we'll never get ten people to a table   don't worry  the rescue team have arrived to solve the seating problem     don't tell me not to worry    no  i     i've been on the phone all day to that stupid company   passed between departments and put on hold   if i hear another verse of greensleeves  i'll scream     can we get in the house  mum        binky  hello  hello    ooh  ho ho   hello  binky  i've got something for you  binky     ooh    ginger     howard  i think he doesn't like ginger        sorry  it's the only place it could be    oh no   we'll have to get into the main sewer   if we only had one legged guests coming  we'd be fine  plenty of legroom     but we don't    i'm sure there's a simple solution   oh  good  perhaps you'd let me know what it is   oh  well  er       sophie    how's my favourite sister in law to be   have you seen what i'm meant to be wearing     it's elegant    it's crap     oh  for goodness' sake    it's ok for you   you'll be in 20 feet of crushed white silk and i'll be waddling in this piece of crap     sophie    no  i'm not wearing it   for goodness' sake  don't be silly     take it away  i'll go like this    sophie   the whole idea is that all the bridesmaids' dresses match   isn't it  howard   howard   oh  absolutely  all the bridesmaids' breasts should match   er  i think i'm going to go catch up with your dad   oh  and how's my favourite father in law to be   hello  howard     oh  how's the wall coming on    churchill was right   bricklaying is a wonderful cure for stress     oh  absolutely    have you tried it     er  no  i haven't    then how do you know   i don't  i suppose    so  send anyone down today     sorry    send anyone down today     how do you mean    did you send anyone to prison     no  not today    ah  feeling lenient  then  were you     no  i wasn't in court today    ah     i rarely work mondays    i see     i've been building my wall    right   i'd  er    quite like to have been a judge   silence  in court  i sentence you to life imprisonment   objection  your honour  overruled  may i approach the bench   permission to die  case dismissed     can i have my trowel back    yes  of course   well  the wall's looking good  er     i  think i'd better go and unpack   good talking to you    no  no  no  no  no     lamb goulash    oh     your favourite  howard    thank you  angela     ooh    right  tuck in  everyone   ooh     how is it  howard    mm  mm   i like a man who likes his food    which reminds me   cousin libby has suddenly become a vegetarian   do you think we have enough vegetarian options   for five minutes  can we please not talk about the wedding   what a splendid idea   so  how are things in the world of publishing  howard   oh  er  very good  angela  thanks   i've got a brilliant new writer  shane latimer   who i've poached from another publisher   he's gonna be huge   should make myself and the future mrs steel here very comfortably off     shane latimer    yeah  yeah  do you know him   didn't he write campus sluts   yes  yes  i  um     i believe that was one of his  yes  er     that was actually for the other publisher  um  not as bad as it sounds     i know  i've read it    did you  and  er       absolutely filthy    yeah  well  um       the one i'm doing with him is      some hardcore stuff  quite graphic     this one's pretty tame    there's too much sex about these days     people are obsessed with it    i agree  absolutely   it's everywhere  in the newspapers  on the television   the last thing we need is more sex on the bookshelves   dick  i couldn't agree with you more     so  what's this new book called  then    hot and hard   um    it's actually about a chap that crosses the sahara desert   it's  er    i mean  it's hot because it's the sahara desert  and hard     because it's not very easy   perhaps we should talk about the wedding     hello  granny    hi  granny     i'm afraid we've started  ma    oh   it's the lamb goulash  i don't think i'll bother   so  let's have a look at the ring   yes  i was going to bring the ring   but  what with everything being crazy at the office  i simply forgot     well where is it    don't worry  it's in the safe at the office     you have a safe in your office    yes  yeah   binky  get down     has mel told you the ring's history    no  no     binky    he's a little rascal  isn't he  ooh   let's have a look at you  you little rascal   queen victoria gave that ring to my great grandmother for her wedding     did she  did she really        hello  hello  howard    the ring  a gift from queen victoria   oh  that's nice     any closer to finding it    we're working on it

 roger has to be near the loos   at vanessa's wedding  he got stuck in a corner     he just didn't make it in time    i remember that wedding   they had a marquee in november  it was bloody freezing   you can see the steam coming off roger's trousers in the video     are you all right  dick    pardon   you look like you've seen a ghost     angela  he was inspecting his stools    what   howard  stools   don't be ridiculous  we're not sitting on stools   you can't invite 150 people to a wedding and expect them to sit on stools   right  ok  what if you split the hendersons across two tables   swap the faulkners with cousin libby and ray   move the wilkinsons next to the laycocks   put wing commander phillips next to the schmidts  and pray he doesn't go on about the bombing of dresden   yes  mel  you've done it  well done     ye ugh     what is it   i'll take a closer look tomorrow when it's light   we were just standing here and then we heard these thuds     thud  thud  it went    yeah  it was spooky     scared the living daylights out of me    i've never seen anything like it     perhaps it was a bird    a bird     what kind of bird could do that    do you think it's those squirrels   i knew we should have done something about them   they'll make the lives of the caterers on saturday absolute hell   oh  i don't think it was the squirrels     ah  stilton    mel has cracked the seating plan   really  ah  that's wonderful   aww  well done  melly   yes   dick  i know you're wondering what i was doing earlier  i know what it looked like   but i can assure you i wasn't
