this up   jesus christ   what i'm about to tell you  don't write it up  promise me   all right  won't write it up   bejan wasn't depressed   look  it's not unusual for people like that to keep things quiet   according to his medical records  he was on mirtazepine last august   how do you know his medical records   looked at the code his records were written in   it's something called hl7   well  a new patch was released for hl712 days ago   bejan's records go back to the '90s and yet they have this correction   you've just committed a crime   don't you see   his entire medical history was written within the last two weeks   i'm supposed to arrest you now   which is why i'm telling you knew bejan  we were friends     know you're upset your friend's just died   but you need to go home now before change my mind   don't make the report  please   mean  if they can do that     now   i've got to tell you some stuff   you better sit   think this is about utopia and mark dane  the man that wrote it   last year  spoke to a nurse who worked at shenley  when mark dane was there   she said he was a model patient   quiet  and they thought he must have been some kind of geneticist  but by the time they got to him  his brain was fried   the only time he was ever trouble was when they tried to give him  a new brand of drug and he went psycho   hospitalised three men   the drugs were made by a company called corvadt   so   right  in 2008  a researcher at berkeley called norton wrote  a paper into a new disease called deel's syndrome   it's like huntington's   it's a neurodegenerative disorder where the entire body shuts down   and it's hereditary   but what norton discovered  is that deel's has no genetic history whatsoever   it's not present in parents  relatives  nothing   it's like it just popped into existence in 1986   is that possible   no  not really  no   so he thought that deel's must have been a man made disease   so he looked into the patients' backgrounds for a common denominator   nothing   except for one thing   they'd all at some point worked for corvadt   why do you know all this   it's an image of the genetic mutation in deel's   fuck   hang on    so  what     if dane was a geneticist  maybe he saw this somewhere   drew it into utopia   yeah  only utopia was published 1985 and this mutation didn't  actually exist until 1989   no way   fuck this  mean     what has this got to do with me   ian  please     was in prison   they put me in a cell  they    they accused me of rape   think they're after the manuscript   utopia part two  there must be something in it that they want   who the fuck are you  why do you know this   because     my dad had deel's   he died of it   it killed him   look  do you want to sleep
