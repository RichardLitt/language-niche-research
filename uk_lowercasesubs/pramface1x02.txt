exams are over  life begins  life begins   sasha's party is going to be a generation defining event   you have to be there   you are not going out   why don't you chuck me out  like you did with dad   oh  my god  it's like narnia but sexy   the girl from last night  we did it   you are pregnant  this one even thinks it's twins   did you even use protection  of course i did  i used a condom   yeah  but it really didn't look like you had it on right   how old are you   arggghh     oh  my god   i'm a rapist   i'm a pregnant rapist   you're not a rapist  i'm  and i consented a lot   towards the end  i'm pretty sure you did too   oh  ok  this is such a mess  i'm going to go   but you asked me to come here   that was when i thought you were 20   right now  i'm an ice cream and a zoo trip away from being on a register   so  what am i supposed to do  get back on your bmx  go home  25  and just forget about the whole thing   hey  i didn't come here on my bmx   my mum gave me a lift   come on  quick   so  he was 16  oh  little bastard   what am i going to do  it's going to be all right  because i have got you these   no  i'm not ready to talk about this yet  danielle   laura  you should at least consider it   i know   oh  god  i just didn't think that i'd be the one having the abortion   yeah  i know  my money was on naomi rushbrook  naomi rushbrook   yeah  exactly  what a slut   not that you're a slut   god  that's what people are going to say about me  isn't it   no  well  actually  yeah  but they weren't there   i know you're not a slut   a drunk and a borderline paedophile  maybe  but not a slut   so  come on  just go and have a chat with them   maybe they can fit you in tomorrow  yeah  ok   yeah  because it's not just you this affects  you know   what about me   i don't want to go to uni without my drinking buddy  yeah  i'm sorry   see  your irresponsible actions have real consequences   yeah  i've noticed   oh   jamie's out somewhere but mike's upstairs if you want him   i'll wait   all right  beth love  you know  mike's upstairs   yep  so i heard  off to work   you asking or telling  telling   ok  see you later  have fun  unlikely   is it his birthday  wedding anniversary   oh  right  doing anything nice  i'd be very surprised   keith's forgotten our anniversary for 14 years straight   oh  right  sorry  no  it's all good   as long as i remember and he forgets  i have the upper hand   this is mainly tactical  in fact  you should know this   look at this card   yeah  it's nice   no  it's not  it's awful   however  keith is a sucker for anything with penguins   he will adore this card  and that'll make him feel really guilty that he didn't get me one   aah  then he reads the message   two kisses   i don't get it  one's casual  three  everything's fine but two     no one does two  very unsettling number   so  consciously he will realise that he's in big trouble  and he'll start trying very hard to make it up to me   oh  that's clever   you see  beth  relationships are basically strategy   you accumulate small advantages  until your opponent has no option but to take you out for dinner   why doesn't my mum tell me this stuff    the mystery man returns  weren't up to any trouble  were we   ah  no   come on  jamie  mike's upstairs  let's see how his morning went   here he comes  beth  get out of the shot   i'm trying to capture the moment here  capture this   so  how did it go  wait  let me see if i can see from your expression   just tell us  it was awful   she basically said she never wants to see me again  yes  jackpot   she just dismissed me  what a bitch   i'm just saying  you should probably respect her wishes   yeah  it sounds like you got a free pass  mate   i don't want a free pass   i'm willing to take the consequences like a man   or  or  or you could avoid the consequences like a smart man   i think we should just draw a line under it and move on   it's not like you're going to marry this girl   oh   that's brilliant   if i propose  if i do the right thing  she can't just ignore that   no  no  no  you can't do that   i was saying not marry her  not   no  no  no  it's perfect  no  it's not   yeah  i mean she'll turn me down  she hates me   but if i show that i'm willing to marry her   she can't just write me off   and what if she says yes  jamie  where will we all be then   if she does say yes  i'm best man  right   so  janet  alan has said that he has regrets about his actions   yeah  well  so he should   can you tell us  what are you hearing when he says that   i'm hearing that alan is acknowledging that he has regrets  but i think his main regret is  that he got caught bending his pa over his desk   i don't think that's what he's saying  i think it is  actually  i think alan is starting to think this is a bit of a waste of time   no  no  no  this is good   a healthy amount of confrontation is good here   er  naturally  you'll both have unresolved feelings  about the affair   don't you mean affairs  no  he means affair  affairs   it was one affair  well  forgive me if i don't take your word for that   ok  can anyone see a negative pattern here  i can   is it the one where alan sleeps with people from work and lies about it   is it the one where janet is a cold bitch all of the time   ok  let's try and de escalate for a moment   can you remember last week when i asked you both to sit down  and draw up a list of positive aspects of your family life   yes  we didn't really have time  i did   ok  janet  what was on the list   well  it said laura  university  her law degree  hmm   good  good   yes  because it's an exciting time for you both  isn't it   and for laura   so  for homework  i'd like you to organise  an activity around laura   is this something you think you could both do   i can  if he can   fine by me  yeah  fine  fine  fine   ok  good  good   fine   we generally say that a good price guide is one to two months' salary   do you have anything in a kinder egg   what about these ones  are they engagement rings   technically  yes  they're obviously smaller  and of a slightly lower clarity   but still very nice rings   no  no  i definitely wouldn't say yes on the basis of this   i'm not asking you   but if you thought this was all i was worth  i'd be heartbroken   i mean  this is supposed to be the happiest day of my life   that's the wedding  there's not going to be a wedding   yeah  not with this piece of junk  there's isn't   maybe it is a little bit small  it needs to look like i really mean it   i need to see it on   not on you  if you must   no  you've got tiny  little  toddler hands  beth   i need to see it on a normal woman's hand   you see  that doesn't look so bad   wow   you've got lovely hands   i'm not authorised to give discounts  yeah   so  what d'you think  think laura'd go for that  i thought you didn't want her to   no  but  in theory  does it look good enough   don't ask me and you shouldn't be supporting the diamond trade anyway  it's immoral   actually  all of our rings are certified   oh  and you've confirmed that with head office have you  julie   they run the whole supply chain past you first  do they   i suppose you check the provenence of every diamond  to make sure they're not funding african warlords   is that how you get your perfect tan   brokering peace deals in sierra leone   how many more have to die  julie  julie  answer me   nice one  beth  couldn't you have waited till we'd bought one   and join the web of complicity like the bloody un   you didn't have to call her a child murderer   she is a child murderer  and you're an idiot   beth  is this because i said you got toddler fingers   come on  doesn't matter anyway   even the cheapest ring would have cleaned me out   just get online  put it on your parents' credit card   then you've got seven days  pop the question  get the no   send it back and get a refund   and your statutory rights are not affected   can you do that  yeah  i do it all the time   that's how comes i got this camera   look   come here  what you doing   come on  jamie  you can't put a price on memories     memories     going in to town   er  yeah  so are we   oh  both of you  yes  together   yes  we're going to do some shopping   oh  ok  well  have fun   no  actually  we thought we'd go together  you know  pick up the stuff you need for university   oh  no  no  i can get all that myself  thank you though   oh  come on  it'll be    fun   really  yes  like a family outing  like a family outing  exactly   um  well  you haven't got anything special planned  have you   no  no  just meeting danielle   well  great  hmm  the more the merrier   ok  we're all going  ok    ooh  here we all go   together   cheers    no  mum  please   i don't need any more bed linen   laura  we should get going   we promised to meet naomi rushbrook at 12 15    yes  we should go  because we don't want to be late for her    i thought you didn't like naomi rushbrook    i always thought she was a very nice girl    thank you for everything   but we should go   she's only got a 20 minute slot  oh     but we've still got to get your toaster     well  that was 300 quid well spent     hi  i'm laura  i have a 12 15 appointment   take a seat   thank you   thank you   can't resist a sale   oh  yeah  yeah  that's much more the sort of thing i had in mind    although i think the phrasing of the question is going to be crucial   so  as best man  i've written down a few options here     ta da      'hi  this is laura  leave a message '  you promise she's not going to find a better man   especially now she's up the duff    discounted bus travel  cheaper cinema tickets    oh  this is a good one    right  if it she looks like she's not going for it   say you'll throw in a rolling  six month  quickie divorce option     'hi  this is laura   '  no questions asked    laura  it's jamie  again   just in case you didn't get my other messages   i'd really like to speak to you   so  just give me a call  please    no  don't say please   just call me  ok   she's just ignoring me     right  we're going to have to go stalker on her   bombard her with texts until she calls you back    no  mike   give it back    mike  mike  give me the phone    mike  don't  jamie  yes    no  mike   mike   mike  don't   trust me    i'm the only one thinking straight in this equation   i really doubt that   open the door    someone has to take responsibility here  jamie   you'll thank me for this later   no  i won't  mike   argh   and do you know an approximate date  of when you think you may have conceived    yeah  i think i can tie that down pretty specifically    well  initially  we'll take you for an ultrasound scan    that'll just confirm how many weeks you are into the pregnancy   sorry   it's ok   it will affect the type of procedure that we use for the actual abortion   if you do decide to go ahead with it   sorry  sorry   that's ok  it's fine   now  obviously you'll want to take some time to think this all through   there may be other people you want to discuss it with   i mean  you parents or partner maybe   medically speaking  the sooner you choose  the better    sorry  i'm going to turn this off    laura  you understand   we can give you all the support you need  but the decision has to be yours  ok   ok  maybe you should just answer that   thank you   hello   'mike  i swear i'll fuck you up '  ah  ah  it's for your own good  give   give it   give it  no   everything i do is love of you  jamie   god  you're strong   ah   something isn't working   i don't even know why we bother    don't bother with any of it   laura   jamie  what the hell are you doing here   i wanted to talk to you     now is not a good time   look  i know you think i'm just a kid   but i want to prove to you that i'm serious    oh  my god  what are you doing   the right thing   i'm asking you to marry me   oh  my god  stop being such an idiot  get up   no  no  no  i'm doing this   laura  i want you to know that i'm here to support you   and be involved and do whatever it takes   yes   what   yes    yes  yes  let's get married   yes  a thousand times  yes   i'm totally in   ah   this is the most thrilling moment of my entire life   now  what   what do you mean  well  obviously there's going to be a big wedding     well  yeah  eventually  i suppose  but it was more about me      are you saying i'm not going to get my big wedding   no  my day  my way   i  er    good  that's the wedding planned   then what    i don't know   i hadn't really thought that far ahead   oh  you hadn't thought that far ahead   that surprises me  cos this all seemed so well planned   no  i just wanted to show you that i'm here for you    really  yeah  whatever you need   ok  i need to find a way of telling my parents that i'm pregnant  without them disowning me   could you sort that out  erm   also  i need to find a way of supporting myself in university   whilst paying for a baby   or were you planning to cover that   i hadn't  i don't know   no  you don't because you're just a kid  and have no idea what the hell you're doing   who's that   don't know   you know   this isn't some little fantasyland where you can give me a magic ring  and suddenly everything will all be ok   this is real  ok  erm   i am having a baby    oh  she must really hate you    first you get her knocked up   then you pick the worst way to tell her parents    technically  i didn't  she did   yeah  can't see what her problem is    well  at least we all know where we stand   apart from your mum and dad   i notice you haven't told them yet   yeah  well  i want to pick the right moment     wouldn't want to get the timing wrong on something like that   shut up    hey   where's the ring   oh  god  i thought her dad was going to hit me  so i used one of your lines   oh  god  what was his line     what the hell is this   it's a sign of my commitment to you     laura  i mean laura and our unborn child   hers and mine   not yours and mine  obviously   and i'm not saying it's forever  let's just see how it goes   oh  and i'll throw in a rolling  six months    no questions asked divorce option   and that didn't win him over   no  it just made him very  very angry   he threw the ring away and then chucked me off the property   jamie love  can you make yourself scarce tomorrow evening    uh  yeah  why   by some miracle    your father has actually remembered our wedding anniversary   right    it's so sweet   he's spent a fortune buying a piece of jewellery online   really   are you sure   i found out when the credit company did a security check   to authorise the payment   he almost pulled it off  bless him   aah  that's so     you haven't told him that you know though  right    oh  no  no  i'm playing along   but i'm going to do a little surprise of my own   i'm going to cook him steak  his favourite    can't let him outmanoeuvre me  eh   oh  god  i need to get the ring back   all right  calm down  don't go all gollum about it   i can't go back  everyone there wants to kill me   hey  don't worry  jamie   i'll get the ring   after all  it's part of the best man's responsibilities   mike  i'm not getting married   hey  come on  don't give up hope    sooo   how did the shopping trip go    i'm sensing it wasn't a total success    no  it went swimmingly  jeremy   right up until the point our daughter told us she was pregnant   right    ok  so how do we feel about this news   how do you think we feel   we're absolutely furious    and somewhat disappointed   hmm  hmm   yes  well  taking the positives   i suppose there is some common ground there  at least   you know what  jeremy   i think our time is up   oh  my god   yes   have you got it   negative  but i have found a lot of weird stuff   i'm not sure this is the sort of family you want to get involved with    why  what's wrong with them   well  from the case i'm building    i think they may have killed one or more old women   what are you talking about   serial homicide  potentially   we're through the looking glass here  jamie   wait   i may be compromised   abort   what are you doing  abort  abort  abort   they're not even talking to me now    no  it's a relief   i don't know what i'm going to do   get out  you   hold on  something's kicking off next door    i'm going  argh    blimey  san  you look nice   what's the occasion   very funny   you not going to change    nah  got another day or two left in this    see you later    what   keith  do you not know what night it is   yeah   course   it's darts night    see you later   hiya  mike  you all right   not really   i've torn my tactical vest   great  jamie  your mate's here   see you later   see ya

rosti   and if you need me  i'll be on the couch having tiramisu   oh  bollocks   so  i was thinking of booking us a table    don't bother   what's this   it's a credit card statement  saying that you have spent 600 quid on jewellery   can you shed any light   and  before you answer   bear in mind  i still have one dart left   i've no idea what this is   oh  come on  keith    it came to this address and i never use that card   who else is going to spend 600 quid on it   oh    so  you start  yes    hmm  yes  and you can just jump in when you think   it'll be fine     oh  we're not going shopping again  are we   now  we've had a chat and discussed all the options   and we want to deal with this together    now  your dad's been on the internet and he's got lots of information   now  it's entirely up to you   you can go nhs or private  we'll cover everything   it might be better not to go through the family gp   jim norris is a good friend   hmm   obviously  there is a time limit   completely up to you  darling   but when you've made your decision  just let us know    why does everyone keep saying that to me   everybody keeps saying it's my choice and you all tell me what to do   if you're all so bloody pro choice then just let me decide   and what do you want to do    i don't know what i want to do  i don't know what i want to do   ok   that's my decision   i don't know   oh  shit   you idiot   i know   i should have told you  but i was trying to do the right thing   oh  come here  you dozy sod    it will be all right    oh  that poor  bloody girl  what's her name again   laura  laura   i'm sorry if i've let you down   say something   hey  come on  son   we all make mistakes   it's not exactly like you were planned either    oh  great
