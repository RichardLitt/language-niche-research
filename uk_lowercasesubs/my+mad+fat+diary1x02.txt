standing there     oh  i beg your pardon    naked   i'm very sorry   you were  fed up with it   why would i peep  what is there to even peep at   rae  be quiet   'it was typical   'the first time i catch a glimpse of another person's bits  'and it's my 76 year old neighbour's   'a romantic milestone burnt into my retinas '  right   first off  rae isn't gonna peep any more   but i didn't peep  just      second off  she'll run a few errands for you  to apologise for any embarrassment   how's that   'living in the totalitarian state of mum was worse than being in prison   'at least there are laws to protect prisoners   'any kind of human right i am entitled to is always swept away by one single phrase '  and don't pull that face at me  rachel earl   so long as you live under my roof  you live by my rules   my mum's in a sham relationship   she's going out with this guy   and he's like     handsome and fit and stuff   but she     she's like me   she's a blob   a blob with a gob   is that how you see yourself   it's how i am   tell me some things that you like about yourself   anything   i can't think of anything   all right  if i was to ask one of your friends what they liked about you   what do you think they would say   they would say      what the bloody hell are you asking me that for    i've noticed that every time you come into this room   you take the longer way round to that chair   i thought maybe you're trying to avoid that mirror over there   ooh  maybe you should open a detective agency   yeah  maybe i should   hardly anyone likes looking in a mirror   in fact  no one likes looking in a mirror   you know what  rae   i'm 47 years old and i still get blackheads   i've got bags under my eyes  that make me look like i've battled a lifelong addiction to heroin   but having said that   i do look fantastic   yeah  i look great   you know what   perfect wouldn't be a stretch too far   i think i look perfect   are you trying to make me hate you   i want you to make it your mission to look in a mirror every day   and no matter how many things you see that you don't like   i want you to say something positive about yourself   that is the stupidest thing i've ever heard   do you know what  it's just weird   is it more or less weird     than being physically unable to look at your own reflection   i'm not doing it   all i'm asking is that you try your     i'm not fucking doing it   what do you like about me   i like everything about you   mmm   be more specific   i can't   there's nothing i don't like about you   you're lovely     but unhelpful   tix   danny   what   danny  let go of her arm   agh  stop it  agh  tix  stop   agh   tix  stop it  agh  agh  tix   agh  stop it  sorry  tix  agh   tix  i said i'm sorry  tix  i forgot  tix

'but i'm not broken '  it's all right   'not any more '  it's all right  it's all right   why did she look at me like that when she gave me my prescription   like  it's just the pill   it's no big deal   i think she looks at everyone like that   i once bought a whistling lollipop from there  and she looked at me  like i'd farted in an empty bag of monster munch  and just squashed it in her face   nah  it's because it was the pill  i know it   i can't believe i'm gonna be doing it  rae   this weekend   shit   shit   so  are we gonna talk about the pool party   what about the pool party   well  i found that hospital tag thing   'i wished for the ground to swallow me up  for a piano to fall from the heavens  'and crush chloe deep into the earth   'but the weird thing was  something even more incredible happened '    ay  ay    hi  archie   hi  rae  i wanted to talk to you at the boozer last night  but you left before i could speak to you   i just  er  wanted to know  if you wanted to come

so  tell me about archie   well     he's an aries  which is perfect  because i'm a sagittarius   and he prefers oasis to blur   but he quite liked parklife  because it reminded him of this holiday that he had in corfu   and he wants to study history at university   cos he wants to be  like  a historian   and he's always coming out with these amazing quotes  from  like  alexander the great and stuff   tix  this could be it   this could be the real thing   i would be nervous about it  though  boys move pretty fast  don't they   he might want to touch you   er     tix  are you forgetting that i really want him to   well  yeah  but think about it   you could be naked in front of each other tonight   you could be looking at him naked   thinking   what do i do now     what do i do with    that    what if i do something to it that he doesn't like    and that's not forgetting the fact that you'll be naked   i would be bricking it  rae  aren't you bricking it   oh  my god   'bollocks to looking in a mirror and whispering sweet nothings to myself   'if i wanted archie to touch me   'it was imperative there was a lot less of me to touch '  'oh  christ   'i'm the tyrannosaurus of sex '

to be a sex maniac  you have to have a man   and as the man i've got is currently on the run from immigration   it's not something i want spread around town   i  erm     it's not just those things   it's the fact     that i come home after a long day  cleaning up the sick    and the piss  of the infirmed and injured  to find     that you have thrown away    35 worth of confectionery  for no reason   i  er     shush   i don't know what game you're playing at   but you're grounded for 24 hours   effective immediately   i can't  i'm meeting some     put    your keys    on    the table

like listening to you talk about stuff   'it was incredible what archie's tongue felt like    'like a small  warm animal darting round inside my mouth   'in that one kiss  i was so free   'free of people telling me what to do   'free of hospitals '  'free of myself '  archie   your hand is on my boob   does it feel good   yeah  it's all right   cool   yeah   will you be allowed out tomorrow

makeup properly   all right  yeah   rae     um  why didn't you tell me   eh  come here   if you want to make someone touch you and you can't change the way you look   i guess the next best thing is to

breadth of his domain  he wept   '  for there were no more worlds to conquer    'that's archie's favourite quote   'my domain is my bed  'i'm weeping for the opposite reason   'the world has conquered me '  it's midday   i know   i'm just about to make a sausage casserole   not hungry   i've got tiger bread and spread for dipping   what spread is it   lurpak   normal or unsalted   normal   obviously   i thought about it   i shouldn't have gone out   i deserve to be grounded   right   right  well  um     since you've thought about it and you're sorry     i don't think you do need to be grounded   you can go out  if you want   just behave yourself  be responsible   karim   rae  it's for you   it's a young man   what   i came about yesterday   come to take the piss  have you  no   just save it  i would never have done it  if i knew you were supposed to be on a date   oh  how very grown up of you   look  i know you don't like me  and that's fine  right   but i just     i think he's a dick for what he did   i didn't want you adding it to the very long list of things you hate about me   finn   the list isn't that long   archie's at work at the leisure centre right now   if i were you  i'd find him  and i'd stick a fucking boot right up his arse   weight watchers is tuesday  yeah   why don't you just tell me where archie is  before i wrap my fist right round your nose   he's in the wet rooms   but it's 50p admission  though   fuck off   rae  shit   are you peeping  no  no  no   no  no  it's not what it looks like   because it looks like you're a pervert  no  er    it

shh   just    just calm down  just wait   i bottled it   i thought if i tried to be straight for a bit    then maybe     you don't know what it's like   having this big bloody secret that could come out at any moment   it's horrible   i'm really sorry   what did you think     when you saw my legs     at the pool party   dunno  er       i thought you'd been in an accident or something    did you think i was a freak   why would i ever think that   why don't you just be brave and tell people   then you'd be free to be yourself   you wouldn't have to worry all the time   come out  in lincolnshire  when i'm still in high school   that's not bravery  that's just asking for it   rh tawney said      what's freedom for the pike is death for the minnow    i think i believe that   archie     you know  for a gayer     you really are a boring fucker sometimes   d'you know what   there is one thing you can do to make it up to me   'well  chop said that archie literally  like  begged you to forgive him'    and then he asked you to go out with him  and you said no    'yeah '  he did beg and that  but whatever   i'm just    i'm at a stage in my life where i am loving being single   that is so hardcore   'why didn't i think of that '  it's fucking embarrassing how good i look some days   so     how long does it take for you to actually believe it   oh  i think it's a lifelong project for everyone   rae   danny  tix would like to say something to you   i'm     sorry for hitting you with the tray   repeatedly hitting you with the tray   that's all right   i should've remembered not to surprise you like that   i forgot you don't like it   please take your hand off mine   'maybe some bodies weren't meant to be touched   'maybe my body wasn't meant to be stroked   '  '  and nibbled and kissed and held   'maybe me and mrs dewhurst had more in common than i thought   'maybe i'll grow old like her     '  alone   'never being touched     'never feeling good   '  caesar's wife was wearing flowing white robes   '  which clung to every curve like a gentle caress   '  the centurion pressed himself against her   '  and she felt his passion  hard and ready   '  '  marcus antonius

are you doing   i must have you  your highness   wow
