ok  so  this is what you missed   the dead are walking the earth and they're trapped here   and some of them are pissed and trying to fight back   yeah  i know  and then there's this tribe  gang  posse of people called the angelics   who have special powers  yeah   and they're thinking they need to stop these dead people   and they're being killed off by the dead guy   first this sarah woman and then this helen woman  and that's scary   and there's paul  who's my best friend   and who can see dead people   we used to think he was mad  but now we think he's    you know   special  and then there's some stuff about mark   my history teacher  whose wife is one of the murdered ones   yeah  there's even more   yeah   now  where's my star wars box set   na nu na nu    shit   so  that's it  then  he killed me and now helen   yeah   that's us gone  then   yeah   mum  mum   i'm done in here   j jay   i need you to talk to mark   and i need you to help me make sense of what's going on   it's inevitable  you know that  neil  the world's coming to an end   there's nothing you can do   there's always something we can do   i always loved this place   anna   mum   mum   your sister was naked   yeah  well  the important thing was that she was dead   dead  naked and in your bed   she was    it was only partial nudity   maybe you're not special  maybe you're just sick   hear me out   dreams represent subconscious urges   which means part of you wants to see your sister dead   naked and in your bed   hi  yes  we need volunteers to sign up  for the school ball committee cos we don't have enough people   it wasn't a dream  it was a vision   it wasn't a dream  it was a vision    sick  you're sick   so  who wants a sign up sheet   thank you   no  the average man spends two weeks of his life kissing   no  there are between six and nine billion condoms produced a year   it's my sister's ball committee  no way   men with more active sex lives are more likely to live past 80 years   we wouldn't live past 18  she would kill us   and knowing she was naked in your dream wouldn't push her to homicide   ha   two weeks  i haven't even got past five seconds   nine billion  well  if you discount the one i wore on my head for that bet     and 80 years   this ball committee is the golden ticket to sex   and as willy wonka told us all  sex is life   mate  please  for our health  if nothing else  we need to get it on with someone   sometime  somewhere   this is important to me  everything's important to you   it should be important to you too  why   cos ever since you started seeing things  you     seeing things   thanks  mac   sure  am i a rabbit  am i rabbit   am i  though  am i  though   don't worry about them  they're 12   yeah  and we'll get older  but you'll still be freaks   sam griegson and greg taylor  come back here   i know you did that to mr newman's car   just a scratch   it was a very offensive sentence  wait   oi  wait  you two   it's a new low   being bullied by prepubescents  a new low   or high  depending on how you look at the world   we're the lowest of the low  no one is as despised as us   that's quite an achievement   and you really think joining anna's committee going to make any of that better   you saw your sister dead  naked and in your bed   a little normality  a little normality   and maybe a bit of golden ticket sex with someone other than your sister  would be good for     hi  hi   i was    wondering when i'd see you again   we need a minute   do you now  mac   did you listen to anything i said  i do  i    i need to talk to him   your friend is quite the mercenary   i wonder if he really cares about anything    or anybody   what   he's quoting star wars  ignore him   i'm not quoting star wars  i'm quoting leia   come on  let's get out of here  you can't quote a film   you can only quote a character in a film   mark  great  come in   so  how's it  er     going   i'm fine   sit down for a minute  would you   when kathy left me     sarah and i separated months ago   now she's missing  it's a different thing  dave   and time off wouldn't allow you to be more help to the police   help with what  they're barely talking to me  i mean   what do you want me to do  walk down the road shouting her name   dave  i need to keep busy   mark  i've just had sam griegson's mum on the phone  making some pretty serious threats   the kid is a little shit  he scratched  newman's a cocksucker  on vince's car   but that's no excuse to drag him halfway round the school   the boy's got bruises on his arm   now  i have responsibilities to the school governors  legal     it won't happen again  ok  you have my word   hmm   consider this an official warning   and then    and then jay is lying dead on the staircase   and then anna's lying dead on my bed   which mac thinks is    weird cos she's semi naked   whoa  whoa  who's mac   well  the guy you just met   what  the mouthy one   so  what  you're telling your visions to him   i wouldn't call him mouthy   anyway  no  and then    then my mum    my mum is     my point is  what does it mean   what does it all mean  what am i   well  i'm not the person to ask   well  then  who is  and    where are we   the monica bryant county care home   or what used to be the monica bryant county care home   come on   you go left  i'll go right   you want us to split up  it's the quickest way to find him   find who  you'll see   i'll see    what   er    yeah  has anyone ever told you you talk like gollum sometimes   hello   hello   i know you   i'm looking for     for someone   are you the person i'm looking for   wait   i think i need to speak to you   neil   then    no  don't  why do you keep running   who are you   what  what   oh   natalie  natalie   you know her  what are you doing   are you trying to get yourself killed  she turned on that fuse   no  she didn't   was she the person you were looking for   natalie  no  i want you to meet eric  i found him   this was your school   there's no precise date on when it started   some of the dead just stopped ascending  they became trapped here   eric's one of the earliest i've ever met   may even have been one of the first  died in 1946   this was your school   he was 70 when he died   the body's kept aging ever since  so he's pretty old   he also used to be one of us   eric was an angelic   did she really turn that fuse on  yeah   so she can touch  yeah   that's not good   this wasn't my school  it was my home   no sudden movements   don't scare him   partially blind  mostly deaf   and he jumps easily   he wants to meet you   come and sit where i am   how    how do i     ssh   what   really   what  he thinks you're important   i important  helen was right   it's all linked  you   the fades  the murders  them touching   the shit has hit the fan  and you're standing right in front of it   i don't    i don't understand   i didn't     ask f for any of    this   i    i don't    i can't    paul   paul  wait   paul  you been ditching  no   yeah  probably  me too   good  snap  jinx   are you going to the ball  probably  definitely   probably definitely   technically  that is the way i feel about it  yeah   everyone else is going   yeah   that's sort of the problem   i'm going  yeah   yeah  no  that does make it    better   i should be getting to class   are you ok  paul   yeah  i'm ok   ok  and if you were a pacifist  what would you argue   i'm not a pacifist   yeah  but if you were a pacifist     what would you argue   i'm not a pacifist  i'd kill them all   if you were a pacifist  you'd argue that the nazi party was born out of violence   now  get rid of that initial violence   world war one     there'd be no need for the nazis  but i'm not a pacifist   i'd kill them all  i'd kill the nazis   fuck them up  thank you  steve  good  great   thank you  really good contribution   i'm going to sign up for the committee   really  yeah   the nazi party was born out of violence   so in a situation of true pacifism  they never would have existed   that's the sort of reasoning that goes down well with the examiners   what changed your mind   you know  stuff   what does that mean  it means i've got my reasons   fuck's sake  paul   you come in late  then you chat  is that appropriate   go on  sir  hit him   so  theme  i was thinking prohibition america   seconded   yeah  there's arse licking and then there's arse licking  trace   hi  can we just sit anywhere  we'll just sit anywhere   not on any of you  clearly  on a    free seat   though if any of you were offering  it has been claimed my bum is nimble   what are you doing here  you needed volunteers   i didn't mean you  good to know   anna  maybe     they can do the    shit jobs   what   happily  we're a dab hand with shit   in fact  ironically  i was born in a toilet   so there was a period of time when my middle name was going to be    shit   paul  please fuck off  this is important   really   yeah   fine  sit down   ok  so  theme  where were we   fuck it  costumes are faggy  costumes are not faggy   if we're brainstorming  have you considered a star wars theme   good point  well made  i know my place   i am the shit   you look like a wet flannel   good  that's the look i was going for   come on  hombre  spill all   there's this girl  fit   dead  dead fit   you getting into necrophilia now  i've been considering it for a while   i've always thought i appealed to the dead   good teeth  you see   dead people like teeth  dead people love good teeth   that's why i floss daily  you're a bad person   no  you're badder  so  this dead girl  what was she wearing   i think she tried to kill me  details   by the way  just so you know    what was she wearing   natalie    natalie   wears    natalie  well  hello  natalie    hello  matthew  you look so strong    it's going to be amazing   and if she died in the 80s  she'll get all my movie references   thing is  though

remember it slightly less fondly than i do  eh   have i got vomit around my mouth  look  don't worry   when you first saw sarah at the ascension point  you followed her   then  when you saw natalie at the orphanage  what did you do   followed her   why  i don't know   because you wanted to know  because you wanted to see   you wanted to know what i was   what sarah is  what natalie is  because you feel it   there's a connection between all of us because you know who you are   eric  he thinks you're more special than any of us  that you've got a destiny   i'm sorry  kid  but that matters   look  if it makes it any easier   i don't know why destiny's chosen a 15 year old boy either   ok  you're still young     for what's coming   it's still far  far too young   what's coming   man   ha ha ha

 ascension  that's the place to go to   i don't really know what it means  being one of you   well  it depends on the person   well  you  what did it mean to you   it was hard at first    but i got used to it pretty quickly   but  of course  i had no one to say goodbye to   what  hang on   well  who do i have to say goodbye to   you don't understand  my son is missing   ok  come and sit down with me  my son is missing   i need to speak with detective chief inspector armstrong   two missing boys  two   we're going to organise teams  it suggests     well  keep me in the loop   sir  just

all   plenty have tried to keep on with their lives   sarah for one   it doesn't work  never   it doesn't work   you can't be one thing and another  you can't be pulled two ways   just trust me on that   so  i say goodbye to      everyone   write 'em a note  make a phone call   tell 'em face to face  but say goodbye   and then you come underground with me   even my mum  i'm not saying it will

mental institute   this is something    so  you teach sam griegson   what about fred taylor  i teach both of them   look    look at the bandages on her wrist   she clearly attempted suicide   i should have known about that   she's got a past that i didn't know about   look  no offence   but i need to speak to the officer in charge of the case   i'll    i'll pass it up   mark  these aren't evidence   they're interesting  but they're not evidence   the chances are these aren't even connected  with what happened to sarah   this is important  no one's doubting your importance  mark   that is exactly what you're doing   now  he's got my number   now it's dark  things might get easier   brilliant  yeah  cos we can see in the dark   get down  get down     that's what they're doing    they're killing

off the surrounding areas   and a budget done of how much to clear   he's 12 years old   i can't mess this up   this is totally unfair  anna     but this is exactly the time when we should be having a party   to make us feel all better   anna    ok  look  compromise   we'll do a minute's silence remembrance  it'll be moving   anna  two boys have died   the dance is cancelled   what a total wanker  he's cancelled it  then   totally  a total wanker  yeah   he's probably in there now  door locked  thrumming away   thinking about the two of you in just your knickers   why are you here  moral support   moral support listens at the door  does it  stalker   stalker  i'm vice president of ball club   ball club  jesus   so that's it  you're just going to give up   no  i'm going to find a room  lock it   and thrum myself off thinking about just you and my brother  in your y fronts   at the end of a new hope  they attack the death star  the death star   i mean they were in flimsy crafts  x wings   x wings fighting the death star   i mean  the name itself implies that you shouldn't attack   it's called the death star   really  please  stop talking   you're actually making me want to kill myself   they were losing the battle badly  and then luke skywalker found the exhaust port   an exhaust port which shouldn't have existed  because the empire shouldn't have made such a mistake  but it did   it did exist  think about it  think about it   all i'm thinking is   paracetamol  slit my wrists or hanging    no  the moral is    the moral of my anecdote is   you should always keep fighting in case you find an exhaust port   an exhaust port  and there always is   there's always an exhaust port   well  generally   probably  sometimes  i just    yeah   we're not cancelling   no   your dad's converting that old church  right   er    i'm not sure that    you can sort it  right   well  not at this    great  exhaust port sorted   anna  anna   exhaust port sorted   he shoots  he scores  and the crowd roar   if you had to walk away from everything     that's a good question   what would you take with you  no   if you couldn't take anything     what  nothing at all   er    a time of war  is it   yeah  yeah  time of war  i mean  could you walk away   hypothetically  hypothetically  time of war   could you walk away from everything   er    i think i would do my duty  and i would leave behind that which i had to and then i would try     no  you're not listening to my question   am i not   maybe  paul  i think that's because  i'm supposed to be asking you the questions   no   no  i need     i need you to answer this   ok  ok   well  try framing it  your    your question  in a different way   well     the war  it would last for ever   the people that you leave behind     you wouldn't be able to get back to them   i guess     i suppose the question i'm asking is     how do you say goodbye   neil   come on   work  come on   this    is so not what it looks like  ok   this was an experiment   well  into what   self harm  into    something i can't explain   paul  if you're    mum  it's nothing  i promise  i'm fine   promise   promise   mum   if i had to go away for a bit     where  i don't know  somewhere   you'd be ok  wouldn't you   well  you're not going anywhere until you've finished your a levels   and then we've got to work out which university is best for you   and then you can do what you like   yeah  putting all that aside     you'd be ok  right   you do know     if anything happened to you  it would destroy me   mum   it wouldn't be ok   not by any degree   you're my son   this is such a bad idea   i'm dressed all wrong  my hair looks like my mum cut it   and i definitely smell of something and it isn't lynx   i smell of candle wax  how can i smell of candle wax   what kind of freak smells of candle wax   i've never smelt like candle wax before   it'll be fine  mac  honestly   you're totally going to rock this   i'm going to be your wingman tonight   you're going tobe my wingman  mm hm   the best wingman ever   you don't even know what that word means   is there any point trying to stop you   i'm busy   so you're going to a party

 crossed with marion ravenwood  princess arwen   ororo munroe   or storm as she's commonly known   and george lucas   george lucas   yeah  well  the sex wouldn't be up to much   but the pillow talk would be amazing   we also had  alan moore on the list but we decided his beard was too big   anyway  my point is    was    is     when we were discussing our female mash up     there was only one girl on     on my mind   you   i'm quite drunk   and i    i say this because    should i ever disappear     i'd want you to know   i'd want you to know  and now you do   come on  let's go find somewhere private   private    why    private  is a euphemism  i'm making a euphemism   i don't know who alan moore is   you don't know what going somewhere private means   i guess that makes us evens   you don't know who alan moore is   are you the designated adult   no   you work for jay's dad  no   someone's vomited  i don't care   why are you here   i'm trying to keep a boy i care about safe

a bit rank   bad pill  lightweight   hey  anna  anna   alicia's locked herself in the toilets again  and she's crying like a bitch   sorry   don't worry  i get it   you're afraid of my sister  a lot of people are   apparently  my first response when i came out of the womb was to cower   it's just     there are two versions of me  you know   one that hangs out with anna and enjoys being popular  and one that     i don't know  likes you   you're brilliant   what   of course   clark kent  peter parker   that    that was     that was just what i needed to hear   two versions of you  you're brilliant   and you're fucking weird   'neil's phone  leave me a message  i'll call you back '  neil  it's paul   i just wanted to say     that i think it's possible   it has to be possible for me to have two lives  by being two different people   because     i can't say goodbye to what i have   and because if i do  then i don't really know what we're fighting for   yeah  from now on     there are two of me   you took your time  yeah   how fucked up am i   quite   now tell me all you can about this boy   ok  then
