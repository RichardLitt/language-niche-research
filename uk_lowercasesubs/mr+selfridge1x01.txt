in the ground  at the dead end of oxford street   this is no ordinary hole   this is a million dollar hole   and in less than one year     yes  one year    this will be the live end of oxford street

out   what the hell are you talking about   you've ignored all our agreements   this ridiculous band  to entertain the construction workers   hiring staff when your store isn't even built yet   your reckless advertising policy  the whole thing is madness   we shook on this  you gave me your word as an english gentleman   i'm sorry  these things happen  i will ask just one thing   what's that  don't breathe a word to anyone until we're up and running   you swear to that  all right  then i consider myself released   goodbye  mr waring   gentlemen  my assistants will give you all the literature you need  about my new store   now  if you have any questions  my door is always open to you   mr selfridge  how's the partnership with old waring holding up   who wants to know  frank edwards  london evening news   i know who you are even if our paths haven't crossed   people tell me that you are one of the best connected men in london   i know it from top to bottom  sir   the press will always be friends of mine in my store   we're gonna be making news  mr edwards   and i can put you ahead of the pack   i put aside a huge advertising budget for the right sort of papers   but i need to be talked about by the right people   it would be a pleasure to show you the town   woman  lovely woman  what a sex you are       i haven't been out of school long      and i haven't really found my way  that is the one and only ellen love         won't be too long  she's perfect  i won't ask what for       i've studied up on pitman's shorthand      my typing's really very neat      i know he thinks i'm quite efficient      but i hope he thinks i'm also rather sweet      he's everything i ever dreamed of      he's got me in a giddy sort of whirl  can we go round to see her afterwards       and when he gives dictation      i get this tingling sensation      i'm so happy to be his      new girl      new girl      is that you  miss towler  yes  mrs payne   payday today  i believe  yes  mrs payne   so you'll be down with the rent later  yes  mrs payne   she's been on about that rent all day   you'd better go down and give it to her   i haven't got it  george  what   it

blindfold backstage  in any theatre in london  here we are   ah  yes   who is it   an old friend  and a new one   frank edwards  come on in  then   i haven't seen you in a long while   now i see you i can't think why i stayed away   allow me to introduce my good friend harry gordon selfridge   delighted to meet you  do make yourselves comfortable   champagne  none for me  thanks   mr selfridge   the mr selfridge  i guess i must be   well     i was knocked out with your performance this evening  miss love   so he was  he couldn't keep his eyes off you  no more could i  of course   well  that's the compliments dealt with  what do you boys want   if it's my company for the evening  i have to disappoint you   i'm already spoken for  that is a bitter blow   in fact  i must get dressed  if you will excuse me   of course  forgive the intrusion  oh  no   i didn't mean you had to leave   i'll pop behind the screen  quite decent you see   so  mr selfridge   you're the man who knows what women really want  are you   gives one a funny feeling to think that here's a man  who knows us inside out   i was rather hoping you might come to see me in the office sometime   i have a proposition that i might want to put to you   a proposition  well  i am very busy but i am intrigued   i'm sure i could try and fit you in   wonderful   here's my card  miss love   thank you     mr selfridge   pa  hey  pa   we missed you   oh  mom  well  son  it's a long way from battle creek  that it is   hello  my love  hello   mwah   come on  i'll show you around   watch your step  get out of the rain   take a look  kids  go on   come on   thank you     who wants to see upstairs    me   gordon  you're straight ahead   and girls  i thought you'd all like to share   oh  harry  i had it shipped in from paris   box sprung   i have missed you so much   you won't get a moment's peace from me   just like it was in chicago  just like   morning  mr selfridge  hiya  mr crabb  everything hunky dory   i wouldn't exactly say that  mr selfridge  why not   i'm concerned that mr waring's money is not in yet   oh  don't worry  crabb  everything is gonna be fine   i hope you made it clear there's an element of urgency   we've already spend   20 000 on advertising   there's a demand in for ground rent of   10 000   the builders are refusing to move forward without bill payment   i said   don't worry   it's my job to worry  mr selfridge   well  do it somewhere else  there's a good fellow   sir  the new heads of department are here   new heads of department  gonna get ahead of the game   crabb  meet your new colleagues  all well  miss blenkinsop   oh  yes  mr selfridge     good morning to you all    good morning  mr selfridge   well  don't you all look fine and dandy   first off  i'd like to say congratulations   you are in at the beginning of something amazing   the other business houses may have started from lowly beginnings  but  with your help  selfridges will be born great   i know you don't know each other yet but let me just tell you  you have been picked out because you are the cream of the crop   the best that london has to offer   you're all wondering why i have employed you without a store to put you in   i am giving you the opportunity of a lifetime   finest merchandise   we are going to show the world how to make shopping thrilling   any questions  mr selfridge  when you say   no expense spared   how literally are we to take that  absolutely literally   i want product range and i want product quality   i want merchandise that people will desire   merchandise people don't even know they will desire  until they see it right in front of their eyes   now  i expect great things from you   pack your bags  ladies and gentlemen  go and bring the world to selfridges   it does all seem awfully ambitious  too good to be true   i know   i left debenham and freebody rather in the lurch   i'm sure they wouldn't take me back   i don't know how i'd manage if it didn't come off   i mean  the store's not even built yet   i've heard whispers that he hasn't got the money together yet   these things are most likely spread about by jealous rivals   yes  of course  of course   all the same   mr crabb   we can rely on our salary until the store opens  can't we   i have an invalid wife at home  absolutely  mr grove   all is in order   ice cream  i guess  ice cream   we'll have a whole department for ice cream   make sure it's real american ice cream  of course   gordon  toys and guns   toys and guns  make a list of the best kind   beatrice  can't we have a special place for children to play   while the moms are shopping  that is a great idea  b   good morning  good morning  listen to this   mr selfridge's ideas are grandiose  and his confidence boundless   we shall await with interest to see whether that confidence is misplaced   and this fellow here accuses me of tempting people to dishonesty  by proposing to put the goods out on open display   out into the garden  children   what is it with the press over here   it seems as if they want us to fail   it's a beautiful morning   there's always prejudice against something that's new   but can't they give a fellow a chance  they will   once they see the store for real   the garden is so beautiful this morning   why don't we join the children  hm  i'm late  i'm sorry   but i will see you later  oh  all right   come on  girl  those floors aren't going to scrub themselves   good morning  sir  morning  good morning  mr selfridge  morning     good morning    morning  mr selfridge   have you seen the papers  yeah  not so good   they'll change their tune once they see how much we're gonna put into advertising   and when their wives tell 'em what a great place we are to shop at   you clearly haven't seen this  what   waring's pulling out  what   he promised me  i have to say  i did warn you  mr selfridge   he swore he'd keep it out of the papers   mr selfridge  mr selfridge  yes   am i to understand that you knew about this already   he did say something last week  so much for english gentleman's agreements   and you thought it proper not to inform me  as head of finance   while you authorised all sorts of expenditure  without the capital to back it up   mr crabb  this is business  it happens all the time   you realise it's going to be difficult to find a backer at this late stage   and in the event you do find someone   they'll know we're in a poor position with building about to start   i hate to think what rate of interest they'll make us pay   well  you're just a little ray of sunshine  ain't you  mr crabb  mr selfridge  i left a very good position to join you  but i have to say that the reckless way that you conduct your business   dismays and yes    frightens me   it frightens me too sometimes  mr crabb   hold your nerve  keep your head down   let me handle the rest  i think we should redouble the advertising   ye ah   frank edwards  just the man   lady mae is a wondrous woman   really she's lady loxley but everyone calls her lady mae   used to be a good time girl before she snaffled lord l   knows everyone who is anyone in london   she could get you an investor at the drop of a hat   lady mae  may i introduce my good friend harry selfridge   surely not the selfridge we've been hearing and reading about   the very same  well  we are honoured   the honour is all mine  lady mae   is lord loxley in town  no  frank  lord loxley is in the country   lord loxley is generally in the country and i'm generally in town   there are so many different ways to run a marriage  don't you think   and to never see each other  that's one of the very best   i second that   excuse me   come and sit down with me  mr selfridge   so  you've been creating quite a stir  haven't you   i certainly hope so  and yet  london don't seem to care for you   oh  how do you make that out   london doesn't like being shown how to do things   especially by outsiders  is that how you feel too   not necessarily   i rather like being shown how to do new things   especially by a man who knows what he's about   but    people like us aren't used to going shopping   it's not considered smart  a gentleman will visit his tailor   a lady will send for her dressmaker and so on   we are going to have to change the fashion   we  hm   oh  yes  of course   that's why you're here   oh  no  i would never    i do read the papers  mr selfridge   you need a new backer and you need him fast  or your visit to our island will be cut rather short   what you read in the papers ain't necessarily so  ma'am   but i am flattered that you take such an interest   we do like to give our ex colonials a helping hand when they need it   who says that i need a helping hand  everyone  mr selfridge   tony  oh  you're a disgrace   i know  i know  don't be a bore   try not to make an exhibition of yourself  darling   how did the audience go  she's quite a woman   is that her son she's with  son   good job you didn't say that to her   no  that's young tony travers  he's her lover  is that so   that's lady mae for you   good evening  sir  may i take your coat  sir   oh  very good of you to wait up for me  fraser but there's no need   i like to ensure everybody is safely home before i bolt the door  sir   ah  i guess you do   everything all right  sir   everything is fine  fraser  absolutely fine   i'm glad to hear it  sir   good night  sir   hey  pa  you should be asleep   pa  what's a huckster   he's a man who buys and sells things   oh   why do you ask   well  it's just one of the kids at school said   your guv'nor is nothing but a common huckster    what did you say  well  it sounded insulting so i knocked him down   well  he probably did mean for it to be insulting  but there's nothing wrong with being a huckster   you tell him one day you're gonna run the firm  and he's gonna be asking you for a job  ok  yes  pa   all right  get some sleep   good night  pa  good night   hey   i fell asleep   you smell so good   did you have a good time   i had an interesting time   but i'm so glad to be back here with you   flatterer  it's the god's honest truth  rose   there's no one in the world i'd rather be with than you   are you doing all right  son   maybe we shouldn't have come  ma   you're in trouble  right   i'm in over my head   you've been in over your head before and come out of it fine   anyway  what's the worst that could happen   bankruptcy  my family out on the street   we came from nothing  we're not going back there   there must be something you can do   there is someone who can help me find an investor  but i do not wanna be beholden   is that your pride talking  no  it's my gut   this person could be very dangerous   so  outsmart them   to sup with the devil you need a long spoon   you taught me that   you know  harry     if your father could see you now  he'd be so proud  no   what  just don't talk to me about him   what do you mean  your father was a hero   you remember him any way you please but as i remember it   it was always just you and me   lady mae   i'm surprised and flattered you're here again so soon  mr selfridge   i wanted to introduce you to my friend  lady mae  henri leclair   just arrived from america   are you an artist  monsieur leclair  you have the look of one   actually  henri is the best window display man in the world   and here we all are   how delightful   what can i offer you gentlemen  champagne   none for me  thanks  i don't drink   i would be delighted  we'll have champagne  please  pimble   and coffee   monsieur leclair  tell me what it is that you do   oh    erm     i don't dress women like fashion designers do   i dress space   each selfridges window will be like a painting   and the people looking in imagine themselves  in the story we are telling   maybe in the window there is handsome young man  and his beautiful lady and he's looking at her with passion   maybe they are going motoring   you'd put a motor car in the window   yeah  why not   how fabulously extravagant  who's driving   the lady or the gentleman   that's a good question   i must say  mr selfridge  yours does seem a thrilling enterprise   one i would love to share with my friends   and we must be the best of friends  mustn't we  harry   of course  a lady in my position occasionally needs a favour   i may call on you from time to time in that regard   mightn't i   one good turn always deserves another   then we understand each other   are you fond of shooting   s shooting   i think you might enjoy it   come down to the country on friday   there's someone i'd like you to meet   monsieur leclair  as you are a man of taste   will you make sure that mr selfridge arrives in the latest knickerbockers   knickerbockers   i do so enjoy a shapely calf   i'm going to be straight with you  selfridge   i choose my business ventures as i choose my horses   with the horses  i look them straight in the eye  as i'm looking at you now and i take a view   i'm generally right but if i'm not   well  don't waste time  it's straight off to the knacker's yard   i happen to think you're all right  if it turns out i'm wrong     all right   all right  mr musker   make sure you have your references ready   no interview without a reference   mr selfridge doesn't like haughty and he doesn't like obsequious   friendly and respectful  that's the watchword   the chief wants men and women who are ambitious  and wish to better themselves   no flirting  no love affairs if they want to keep their jobs   and female assistants who marry will have to leave   make sure they know that   there are five applicants for every position   so we can afford to pick the very best   look at their shoes  their fingernails   and above all  look deep into their eyes  and see if you can't fathom their souls   yes  miss   if you please  sir  i've come to see the master   mr selfridge   i've come about a position   here  in the house   no  in his shop  i'm a shop girl   but don't you know this is mr selfridge's private residence   well  this is the address he gave me   look  he gave me his card   please  i've come ever such a long way   come in  miss   would you wait over there  please  miss   i'll go and see if mr selfridge is at home   now  what's all this about   if you please  sir  i was    erm     i was hoping there might be a position for me  i hardly think     i served you on the glove counter at gamages     l last year   agnes towler   and you were so kind as to buy these for me   oh  of course  i remember   i was very demanding  you were very patient   the floorwalker was very tall   so  you want to leave gamages and come work for me  is that right   i was dismissed  sir   really  why was that   erm    conduct unbecoming  sir   it was    it was that same day   he said i shouldn't have let you behind the counter  and get the stock out   i'm so sorry   it's all right  i never liked it there  sir   i'd much rather come and work for you   all the    all the girls are talking about selfridges   you have no idea what it's like to work for me  though   i won't tell a lie  sir  work's been     it's been very hard to get any work these past months   and without a reference  you see     i got you into this mess  the least i can do is give you a chance now   come tomorrow morning  9am sharp  and ask for the chief of staff   y yes  mr selfridge  thank you  mr selfridge   fraser  yes  sir   get miss towler a cab home and pay for the driver   certainly

thank you  this side  miss   thank you  next   thank you  would you wait there  please   this is a game  isn't it   i hope i remembered to wish behind my ears   nervous  a bit   bet you'll be fine  miss towler   oh  that's me  good luck   thank you  could you wait there  please   hands   previous experience  i worked on the glove counter at gamages   references   i haven't got any  i'm sorry  miss towler  next   but i explained to mr selfridge   you explained to mr selfridge   yes  and he said to speak to the chief of staff   did he indeed  well  we shall see about that   mr grove  yes  miss mardle   i have a miss towler  miss towler   yes  i have a note about miss towler   it's very irregular  well  who are we to reason why   straight from the chief himself   well  it would seem  miss towler  that you are a special case   you will be starting as a senior assistant in accessories   and i must tell you that accessories is my department   which means you will be reporting to me   mr colleano   mr conway   i don't see anything special about her  no  nor me   ah  ladies  please follow me   mr selfridge himself wants to have a look at you     good morning  ladies    good morning  mr selfridge   like the uniforms  oh  yes  mr selfridge   glad to hear it because i designed them myself   learnt your scripts  yes  mr selfridge  give me the first floor   first floor for menswear  luggage and hairdressing   please stand clear of the closing doors   thank you  ladies  good as poetry   come on  ladies  get to work   we open in a week   miss towler   we have three girls in this department but four in accessories   so  if miss towler doesn't work out  i'd like to know about it   thank you  miss mardle   a place for everything  and everything in its place  miss towler   and memorise as you go   to work in accessories is to work in the most exacting department   ignorant people think we deal in little trifling things   but the accomplished accessories assistant has at her fingertips  over 6 000 separate items of merchandise  and i shall expect you to know them all and locate each one  at a moment's notice  is that understood   yes  miss mardle   i can't imagine what they were thinking of   appointing someone so young as a senior assistant   but still  i can see you make a good effort at presenting yourself   i just hope you won't let it go to your head   i won't  miss mardle   i should hope not   i shall be watching you very closely  miss towler   and you two  have you nothing to do but stare    get on with your work  not long till we open   every second counts   horrid old cat   and little miss towler   our colleague  senior assistant  if you please   she's a bit of gutter slush if ever i saw one   it's ellen love   it's not  it is  it's never   please  miss love   will you sign your photograph for me  please   of course i will  dear   and now could one of you kindly direct me to mr selfridge's office   oh  of course  miss love  should you like to take the stairs or lift   oh  the lift i should think  don't you   this way  please   mr selfridge's office  please  certainly  miss   haven't i seen you before  dear   yes  miss love  we were both in the chorus of frilly dolls at the gaiety   mabel   that's right  what larks  eh   i haven't given up  you know  nor should you   fourth floor  director's offices   lovely diction  dear  thank

why not  i don't think he would like to think he was talked about   i think he'd love it   miss love to see mr selfridge   if you'd like to follow me   miss love   well  here we are   here we are   no chair   i don't like people hanging around  present company excepted   i'll just sit here  then   i need people to understand the essence of selfridges   beauty  elegance  quality   i want your face and your figure on all our posters   you already embody the spirit of the age   women want to be like you and men want to     well  let's just say they want you to be their sweetheart   to put it delicately   so     what do you think   i'm not going to give up the stage  you know   i don't want you to  one will enhance the other   and a little money will change hands   of course  it's a very important role and you'll be handsomely recompensed   well    i must say it does seem like fun   though it's not the proposition i thought you'd have in mind   oh  you're disappointed   i'm honoured by your proposition   and delighted to accept   well  you know where to find me   every night barring sundays   so what was she like  aggie   very nice   you don't mind being aggie   i always think of it as a sort of scullery maid's name   oh  not that i'm casting any aspersions   oh  dear  the things that come out of my mouth   no of fence taken i hope  none at all  kitty   we used to have a cat at home called kitty   oh  miss mardle  isn't it  yes   and this is your little treasure house  yes  ladies   how can i help you mr leclair   i'm looking for something  i don't know what it is yet  maybe me   i need one detail for a window that is almost complete   in this particular window  i am creating a     a picture   like a scene from a play  you understand   a play in a theatre  a play in the theatre  i understand perfectly   good  so  we have two young ladies in a garden   one of them is turning  looking out like this   her hand shading her eyes as if she is waiting for someone   the other is seated  looking down at something in her lap   and that something  that je ne sais quoi   is the focus of the whole picture   so you want us to suggest what she might be holding   this girl in the window  exactly   that little something that will complete the picture   i have it all except that one thing so     well  really  mr leclair  you cannot expect us to do your job for you   oh  no  no  no  no  of course   and you're very busy here  forgive me  please carry on   mr leclair  sir   erm    i thought  maybe  something like this   a silk flower  hm mm   well  it wouldn't fade
