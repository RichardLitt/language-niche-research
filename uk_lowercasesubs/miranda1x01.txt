hello to you and thanks for joining  this is exciting  isn't it  eh   now  let me get you up to speed   previously in my life  my mother tried to marry me off     loudspeaker  someone please marry my daughter   i'm not asking for money   i'm literally giving her away   laughter  she was upset because i'd just told her how i blew my inheritance   i bought a joke shop   no  i love it  although i am worried that hiring my oldest friend to manage it was a mistake   and that is how we will take this franchise global   it's a bit much  isn't it   i mean  we're just a little shop that sells     squeaking  shush and submit   klaxon sounds  and today i'm over excited because apparently gary preston's back from his travels  he's lovely   but i always make a cockup if i see him   well  there's never any cockup involved  if you see what i mean   how naughty   oh  but the last time i saw him     got to dance to this one     stop right now thank you very much    i need somebody with a human touch    hey you  always on the run    got to slow it down baby  got to have some fun     say nothing   we'll speak no more of and let's crack on with the show    morning  stevie  afternoon   it's

realistic  aren't they  not really  no   aren't they   laughter  can we just concentrate   but it's nearly lunchtime  i'm meant to be having a reunion lunch with the girls   you hate the girls   i know  but as tilly says   when you're dumped in a boarding school dorm aged nine   you'll bond for life  even if you hate each other   or in my case  get embarrassed being out with people with public school nicknames   in my class  milly  tilly  bella  bunty  hootie  pussy  puggle and podge   no  you're right  i'm not going  good girlie  work  not shirk  or do you want our business to fold   my
