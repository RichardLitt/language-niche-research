cheering  fair play   but i have to say     booing  no  no  no  no  i have to say   actually   i'm with rafe on this one   good though your voice is    and it is good   it's not the most magical sound in the world   it's just    good   i don't think anyone's really hearing it   certainly not the guys in the audience   these looks you got going on kind of get in the way   men will want you  women will hate you   all the time you're on stage   couldn't help picturing you   in an erotic scenario   cheering  getting pretty turned on  if i'm honest   right   you've got this pure beauty  what seems to be a knockout figure   and this sort of interesting innocence going on   that's something i think rafe's erotica channels  could really play with   absolutely  that's what i thought  the moment i

  come on   got our attention  as requested   what do you want to say   have you prepared a speech  is that it   speak   i haven't got a speech  i didn't plan words  i didn't even try to     i just knew i had to get here  to stand here  and i wanted you to listen   to really listen  not just pull a face like you're listening   like you do the rest of the time   a face that you're feeling instead of processing   you pull a face  and poke it towards the stage   and we lah di dah  we sing and dance and tumble around   and all you see up here  it's not people   you don't see people up here  it's all fodder   and the faker the fodder  the more you love it   because fake fodder's the only thing that works any more   it's all that we can stomach  actually  not quite all   real pain  real viciousness  that  we can take   yeah  stick a fat man up a pole   we laugh ourselves feral  because we've earned the right   we've done cell time and he's slacking  the scum   so ha ha ha at him   because we're so out of our minds with desperation   we don't know any better   all we know is fake fodder and buying shit   that's how we speak to each other   how we express ourselves  is buying shit   what  i have a dream   the peak of our dreams is a new app for our dopple  it doesn't exist   it's not even there   we buy shit that's not even there   show us something real and free and beautiful  you couldn't   yeah  it'd break us   we're too numb for it   i might as well choke   it's only so much wonder we can bear   when you find any wonder whatsoever  you dole it out in meagre portions   only then until it's augmented  packaged  and  pumped through 10 000 preassigned filters  till it's nothing more than a meaningless series of lights   while we ride day in day out  going where   powering what   all tiny cells and tiny screens and bigger cells  and bigger screens and fuck you   fuck you  that's what it boils down to   fuck you for sitting there and slowly making things worse   fuck you and your spotlight and your sanctimonious faces   fuck you all for thinking the one thing  i came close to never meant anything   for oozing around it and crushing it into a bone  into a joke   one more ugly joke in a kingdom of millions   fuck you for happening   fuck you for me  for us  for everyone   fuck you     that was  without a doubt   the most heartfelt thing i've seen on this stage  since hotshot began   cheering  brilliant   you     you're so articulating something we all   and i mean everyone in this hall   something we all agree on   even though we may not comprehend all of it   i think i'm right in saying we do feel it   even me   i know you've got me down as this creature   you know  hey     i get where you're coming from     i like your stuff    it's
