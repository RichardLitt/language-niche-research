 first class passengers  please make your way to gangplank a  gangplank a  please   i'm sorry  hallam  i had to go back for my flowers     do you really need them    they were a gift   from the foreign secretary   i'm going to display them in our suite at the dorchester   with the card  where people can see   king's condition grave  king's condition grave   he wasn't even ill when we left washington   they're saying it's bronchitis   the royal family have travelled up to sandringham   oh  dear   if he dies  will it change things in whitehall   it will change things almost everywhere   odd numbers are this side   it must be further down   it's been shut up so long  i'm surprised the lock isn't full of cobwebs   it's like a fairy tale   hallam   we're hardly newlyweds   this is our first proper home   oh  my good lord   what a ghastly old mausoleum   i rather thought it might be   oh  i am so glad i booked the builders in advance   hallam  hallam   i think the bulb's been broken   it's as though the whole house is still sleeping   this house is going to see such life   there'll be lights at every window   bowls of lilies on every surface   i want to sit and gaze at you each evening   sit  and listen to the wireless and not talk   because i know you so well we don't have to speak at all   thank you   sir hallam is a diplomat   we shall entertain a great deal   we require a butler with sommelier experience   and a housekeeper  of course  to oil the wheels behind the scenes   then a parlourmaid  and chauffeur cum manservant   and absolutely the best cook you can find me   very well  my lady   what a splendid teapot   it was a gift  my lady  from my late employer  lord bellamy of haversham   do you a budget in mind for staff   this is what my husband suggests   i see   although  if you don't mind my saying so   with a professed cook you'll be wanting a kitchen maid as well   and a pantry boy who can double as a footman   you'll need to account for a wage for them   yes  but they'd be very juvenile  and grateful for the experience  surely   there are several possibilities in situations wanted   perhaps you could arrange for us to meet them   and is there a nursery to consider   i'm not entirely sure   my husband inherited the house when we were abroad   and his father bought it when he was in india   the poor chap died without ever having lived there  and it's been empty for six years   what i was hoping to ascertain  lady agnes   was whether there were any children in the family   no   no  i'm afraid there aren't   the house is in eaton place   number 165   so not far to walk  when you come to carry out the interviews   i usually     do that here  my lady   i'll be supervising builders   meeting at the house will be the most convenient thing   may i assume this is all within your powers   yes   splendid   king's life draws to a close  king's life draws to a close   i should buy a black hat  now he's definitely dead   he was an exemplary monarch   i cried on the train   and in the street   of course  it's queen mary i'm on the rack about  being a widow myself   it's distracting me from work   do you want this new position or don't you   i can't be making decisions when i'm all wrung out like this   besides  you said the money was no good   the money's never any good these days   but there's no one to touch you for society cuisine   no  i don't know  miss buck   i'd have to give notice at virginia water   you told me you couldn't stand virginia water   they're raincoat manufacturers   and you knew that when you sent me there   not to mention i prefer a basement kitchen   this one has a basement kitchen   how do you know   it's in eaton place   number 165     the bellamy house    yes   smart young couple  they want it all done up properly   you ought to ask if they'll take you on   upstairs maid again   you'll be more secure than you are running this place   mrs  thackeray  you can't turn back the clock   forty years i was in service to that family   staff were loyal  once upon a time   yeah  it was a one way street   i'll warrant you didn't get a pension   apart from your hallmarked pot   we'll end up dead in harness  like the king   gangway   we discussed my plans for this bathtub   it's to be plumbed in on the attic floor to make a servant's bathroom   beg your pardon  your ladyship   i'm going to go to the stationer's to approve sir hallam's letterhead   there are some things only i can do   i'll join you this afternoon for the footman's interviews   there's only one boy coming  my lady   none of the others were keen on the terms   hands  please   hands  ivy   it won't hold me back   i've won prizes for my peeling   is that true  matron   we gave her a packet of hairgrips for progress   everybody touch their toes   and stand up again   you may leave the room   i'll race you   second on the left seems suitable enough   winnie  we're working on it  but she wets the bed   the girl on the end looks nice and quiet   joyce   nervous  she's not ready to live in   puce dress   you'll be nailing your valuables down   you haven't brought me four to pick from   you've brought me a choice of one     up the west end that's the best end     where the night clubs thrive    down into a dive you go    now there's a jazz queen she's an 'as been     'as been lord knows what    every night she's there on show    she dances underneath a magic spell    she's full of charm and gin and scotch as well       i think you'll find that according to mr  george formby   fanlight fanny was full of charm and beer  and stout as well   but they're men's drinks   fanlight fanny was a woman   it's a pun  child  on the word  stout    the lady in question was clearly well upholstered   get out of there at once   you'll mark it with your shoes   go and wait in the kitchen  and take your friends   your plans for the plumbing are rather unique   a bath in the hall will be quite an innovation   are you here with regard to the housekeeper's position   what's that   mr  amanjit  come quickly  they're upsetting solomon   stop screaming  you'll make him worse   oh  thank you  mr  amanjit   poor solomon   he'll need sweet tea   if there's nothing in the kitchen you must take him to a cabstand   very good  madam   every morning  as soon as he sees me open my eyes  he applauds me   i can't tell you how that boosts one's confidence   the monkey applauds you every morning   well  i don't mean mr  amanjit  he's my secretary   hallam  dear   are we not to kiss   it's been quite some years   agnes  i would like you to meet my mother  maud   let's have no embarrassment   you would get married just when nehru had demanded independence   and hallam's father simply couldn't leave his desk for a wedding in wales   i always hoped i would know you from your letters when we met   mother  the last we heard you were going to tangier   oh  i stayed for three days   it was full of the british wintering  and that sours a place like nothing else   you know  i haven't lived in england for over 30 years   it was time to come home   now  where shall i put your father   the sikhs refer to death as  passing through the fire    the mantel shelf seems as good a place as any   this will suit me very well as a study   please don't make hasty decisions   there's nothing hasty about this decision  hallam   i always intended to write my memoirs when i had some time   now i have all the time in the world   i know she'll never mention it   the clause in father's will  that said i must provide her with a home   hallam   you can provide her with a home without allowing her to commandeer whole rooms   i was planning a cocktail party on the ground and first floors  and we can't do that now   why didn't you stand up to her   i was brought up to be polite to strangers   besides  if i'd tried it would have proved my father right   proved he couldn't trust me to do the proper thing   you always do the proper thing   lady agnes   so  john  you were trained in domestic service by the scouts   yes  madam   they ran a special camp near us  for the unemployed   table laying and napkin folding   although that got a bit entertaining in the wind   is there no work in your own part of the world   there's the pit   i want him to get on  sir   i want him out of our village  and somewhere mixing with a better class of person   i'm sure all our servants will be respectable   i've forbidden him to touch strong drink   i happen to think that's very sensible   this is a splendid chance for johnny  mrs  proude   he'll receive superb training   and a chance to consolidate his references   oh  begging your pardon  my lady  he's only got the one   one what   reference  sir   and i'm quite sure it's absolutely glowing   well  that's your fresh start organised   agnes  dear  i'm glad you called by   mr  amanjit  will you bring out the moroccan box   i've heard about the footman and i have serious misgivings   i've never engaged a servant without two references   even in india where most of them are verbal   the boy has never had a job   i chose him because he ought to have a chance   you chose him because he's cheap   now you're here  we should discuss the jewels   you'll be glad to hear that all of this is at your disposal   i have no use for it now   my father had to let our family pieces go   when i came out i used to look at all the other girls with their  diamond clips and stars  and i knew i could never begin to compete   where one cannot compete  one must aspire   oh  i always aspired   i'm going to treat my sister to a diamond star  when she comes from wales to do the season   it's as well you're bringing her to london   no girl gains perspective until she's transplanted   it's a universal law of life   now  you'd best try this on   no good getting it out for the coronation ball and finding it doesn't fit   it is all diamonds   hallam said he thought it was   it might have been made for you   i always feared i hadn't the face for a tiara   greville knew   he never failed to compliment me   i hope it doesn't shut before we get to view him   it's a lying in state  open till the small hours  lady agnes says   i wish you'd say yes to her   the trouble with aristocrats is they want  savoy style food from a stone age kitchen   they wouldn't care if you cooked it in a cauldron   so long as it's dished up under a silver dome   as a matter of fact  they've got a new world gas range   and i thought you liked aristocrats   i like proper ones   it's a very new baronetcy  they're practically self made   i'll still warrant there won't be refrigeration   coldspot super six  coming from harrods tomorrow   believe me  hallam  old chap   i would like nothing more than to sink into a chair in  glorious oblivion in the fug of that enthralling bar   but i swear to god   every petty princeling in europe has fetched up here   expecting ringside seats for my father's funeral   while i  of course  am now the king's brother   still the youngest  still merely duke of kent         but everyone assumes i have increased influence   will that be all  your royal highness     yes  thank you    very good  sir   old man look after you in his will   yes  he owned some mines in udaipur     diamonds    asbestos  deadly dull   i sold them  advantageously   and  of course  he managed to leave me mother as a makeweight   it's a rum sort of chapter  all of this   fathers shuffling off this mortal coil     babies appearing    or not appearing   we're old men  old chap   splendidly married and gainfully employed   one does rather wonder how it came to this   hallam  have you been briefed on joachim von ribbentrop   engineered the anglo german naval agreement last year   not briefed as such   i understand mr  eden isn't keen   eden hopes we've seen the back of him   ribbentrop has no fixed portfolio   he signs himself ambassador extraordinary   but he answers directly to hitler   he may approach you socially   is that not good   remains to be seen     you look tired    bone tired   it's been one absurd row after another   and it's all been david's doing   now he's king  he does whatever he likes   have you heard about his yankee woman   mrs  simpson  oh  yes   much discussed in washington   she's even in the papers over there   she isn't in london  it's all been stifled   i've tried talking to him  but the monarchal drawbridge has gone up   i do love him  you know     it is not a help    love   it is such a bugger of a thing   did anybody see you   no  my lady   cod and two penneth  as you asked  no salt  plenty of vinegar   it's the vinegar smell that was driving me wild   the builders seem to have them every day   shall i fetch a plate for you  my lady   nobody's looking     can i tempt you    no  thank you  my lady   now  miss buck  i know i gave you clear instructions about staff     i am making enquiries  my lady   and you must find me a successor to mr  hudson   he used to be the butler here  his name's on the cellar key   but i've realised that i don't need a housekeeper   i'm finding all of this the most enormous fun   i see   as you wish   though i shall need your help  naturally   until we're settled in   blessed are the meek  excuse me   is summat amiss     who are you    i'm johnny proude   i'm the footman in training   i'm ivy morris  and i'm all at sea   miss buck said i had to make it up myself   but this mattress weighs a tone   in barnardo's we practise on a modern bed   it takes two  that's all   now grab your side and pull it as tight as you can   there  look at that   smooth as an iced cake   we aren't supposed to go in the other servants' rooms   not supposed to lock our doors neither   you reckon they come snooping   i put that there deliberate   in case they think they've got me beat   one foot in front of the other  johnny   left  right  left     how many times have i told you  left  right   you should be able to balance the tray with one hand whilst you open the door with the other   no  no  no     the pathless gorges of baluchistan  are described by the warriors of that region  as their friends   as a bride of three months     carried on a swaying litter         i was unable to embrace that sentiment   lady holland  there's a bird's nest in the grate   it must have fallen down the chimney   but it's got an egg in   then you must get rid of it   it's probably cracked  and if solomon finds it  he'll eat it   and he shouldn't eat eggs unless they're hardboiled   is it cracked   i see no crack   i see a perfect egg  and that egg may yet become a life   now  go and lay a fire for lady holland   she feels the cold  and it will warm her bones   it's the king's first broadcast to the empire  why won't it come on   because you value looks above efficiency   that wireless is all  the one in the kitchen is much more practical   may the future bring peace  and understanding throughout the world   prosperity and happiness to british people   and may we be worthy  of the heritage which is ours     god save our gracious king    long live our noble king       god save our king    send him victorious    happy and glorious    long to reign to over us        oh  do open the door  somebody     god save the king      i've just come all the way from wales   persie   hello  sister  darling   i haven't any money for my cab   but spargo was meant to meet you from the station   i got an earlier train   i don't want anyone touching my things   it's bad enough being told to dress for dinner  without having some grimy brat diving into my suitcase     it's only ivy    i'm choosy about  who gets to touch my underwear   what on earth is happening   i thought i was in the bazaar at bangalore   lady persephone walloped me   maud  there is no need for you to involve yourself   i was defending my right to privacy     is that a crime    persephone   in the space of 40 minutes   you have slapped a servant  distressed your sister  and  by delaying dinner  caused the cook to ruin a marron souffle   if you wish to eat while you're here  i would suggest that you open this door   there's almost nothing in it   a sponge bag  no sponge   two blouses  one of which belonged to agnes   three pairs of knickers  none with lace   and a brassiere mended with a safety pin   the towyns are old money  lady holland   and that means there's none   this can all be changed   what if i don't want it changed   you're just being contrary  do you smoke   no   i shall teach you   but not tonight  you have behaved too badly   when i was your age   i threw all my drawers out of a port hole in port said   why   i was on my way to india  to teach in jaipur   they were so old and shabby   i was ashamed to give them to the stewardess to wash   so i took advantage of the port hole   and bought cheap silk ones when we went ashore   these are from home   they smell of st cadog   that's a castle  isn't it     yes    damp   agnes thinks she's rescued me   but i don't want to be rescued   the minute i say   hurrah  i'm saved    i admit how very horrible my life so far has been   i were just walking passed the airing cupboard and i heard it cheeping   urgh  it's horrible  what's it going to eat   it will require live food   you will need to gather gnats and spiders   there's plenty of them out the back  in my garage   seeing how ivy never comes round there with her mop   in wales  they believe birds in houses are unlucky   do you want to see it  miss   not especially   i'm to meet lady holland at the british museum   i want spargo  and the car   um  you're meant to wait out the front of the house   and get in the back   please  madam   my sister says you're all to call me lady persie   if that's what i want   and i do   i won't call you lady anything if you don't act like one   the thing is  lady persie  there are rules   and you have to stick to them  just as much as us   i'll get you   agnes  dear  do speak to mrs thackeray about the marmalade   she only sends up thin cut  and solomon likes thick   i thought we'd agreed that you should breakfast in the morning room   mr  amanjit breakfasts in there on a tray  i gave instructions to miss buck   did persie tell you who we met at the picasso private view   mrs  ernest simpson   i believe she's rather chic   she is certainly relentlessly well dressed   i understand she's a favourite of the king   i think you'll find that she's his mistress   i know what  favourite  means  dear   tommy lascelles introduced us   she knew all about you  and your position with mr  eden     she might be worth cultivating    absolutely not   her power won't last  the king will have to marry   what if he marries her   he can't  and don't talk with your mouth full   which reminds me  i've just booked you into charm academy   can she start before the party   the party   we're giving cocktails and canapes for 40 guests  mainly connected to the foreign office   next thursday  five until eight   is that wise  when you still don't have a butler   it's not good enough  miss buck   you've had weeks  and we're still waiting   with respect  my lady  you said you wouldn't accept second best   and every single applicant has been exactly that   very well  we shall have to compromise     there are a lot of portuguese about      absolutely not   and i'm not having any drunks   i can't abide the smell of spirits on a man   you may sit  mr  pritchard   so this is the butler's pantry   i'm accustomed to small spaces   it's a legacy from being on board ship   were you ever in the actual navy  mr  pritchard   or have you always been on the cruise ships   i worked for cunard for 27 years   hence my reference from mr  errol flynn   why dry land  after all this time   i developed a mastoid disorder   it causes nausea  in a heavy swell   have you ever been in service in a private home   my challenge  miss buck   was to make a dining room that sat 300 feel like a private home   this was my secret weapon   i could line up a four course setting to within an eighth of an inch   and do you have sommelier experience   of course   but the liners incline towards the fashion   and champagne and spirits were more popular than wine   not that i ever understood the fascination  i am teetotal myself   this is the key to the wine cellar  mr  pritchard   make sure you guard it well   could you bear to lend me your typewriter for an hour   i need to finish the canape menu   mr  amanjit has typed it up   and he's agreed to play piano at the party     has he really    here   i wasn't convinced by the dixie chicken wings   i replaced them with diced egg in aspic   when i was hostess for sir greville  i always included a jellied canape   and made sure that some witty women were invited   bureaucrats relish an entertaining female  and there were scarcely any on your list   so  i asked the hope girls  and the simpson woman   oh  dear  i do believe you think i'm interfering   i believe you were a fine wife to sir greville   and now i'm trying to be a fine wife to his son   i chose our guests with care   you must telephone them  and say an error has been made   i shall put off the hope girls  if i must   but mrs  simpson asked to bring a  particular friend    i imagine it's the king   so i said he'd be welcome   turn right  please  and into the cellar   his majesty the king   it was the way lady agnes said it   reverent  but not in any way intimidated   i shall be hand crimping every vol au vent   you stay in that nest now   you want to see the king  don't you   you want to come for canapes   champagne to the refrigerator   these were supposed to have come in vases   i'm here to organise staff  not flowers   give them here   he's perspiring  and i heard him belch   are you sure it was his mastoid   i shouldn't wonder if it was nerves     we're all nervous    speak for yourself   and pass the cheddar straws     down into a dive you go    there's a jazz queen  she's a has been  has been lord knows what     every night she's there on show     i can't believe they've let you have a bath in the afternoon   i was sweating bricks   miss buck had to have a word with me about personal daintiness   i can see your feet   what can you see now  johnny   not much   open the door   not yet   not this door   maybe tonight   when we've finished work   maybe i'll come to you   promise   you'll have to have a cocktail   get your courage up   this is it then   we really do have everything   we even have the king   all guests are to be addressed as sir or madam   with the exception of the duke and duchess of kent   who are both to be addressed as your royal highness in the first instance   and sir and ma'am  to rhyme with ham  thereafter   the king will be addressed as your majesty  then sir   and i want my duxelles milles feuilles held back till he arrives   he's partial to mushrooms  according to the tatler   you've had your orders   now make this household proud   left  right  left  right  one foot in front of the other  johnny   are you all right  mr  pritchard   my stomach's on a knife edge   i was like this at jimmy cagney's 21st   it didn't end well   agnes  my dear     may i introduce mr  eden    lady agnes   my wife sends her apologies   another time  perhaps  it's a pleasure to meet you   i'm still living off the memory of those exquisite roses   mrs  simpson   what a pleasure this is   lady holland   what a wonderful vestibule  you must tell me the name of your decorator   where is that man   may i introduce you to a friend  herr ribbentrop   how do you do   you were expecting someone else perhaps   but  your royal highness  why has mrs  simpson come with him   why not with his majesty   mrs  simpson and ribbentrop are lovers   half of london knows it  the remaining half suspects   but she's the king's companion   quite   one rather suspects there'll be tears before bedtime   what the deuce is he doing here  holland   he's the guest of a guest  sir   rather drifted in   joachim von ribbentrop doesn't drift anywhere   he's out to solicit the british establishment   he wants solid  upper class support for hitler and his nazi party   i see   i hope so   a word  darling  now     this is your mother's fault    i don't care whose fault it is   this is our home  and my reputation   you're the hostess   i need you to take charge   now  miss buck   i have to ask herr ribbentrop to leave  immediately   sir hallam insists  and i don't know what to do   i will inform mr  pritchard   i had a governess from hamburg for a while   fraulein schneider   she could sing just like marlene dietrich   though she wouldn't do it often   one imagines such things could be quite educational   oh  she made me sing every line right back to her in german   ich bin sicher das ihr deutsch ziemlich entzuckend ist   i can't bear to look   he's approaching the sofa   i do hope you're right about this   perhaps you'll let me choose my own guests next time   i wouldn't have bothered with crimped edges   if i'd known some german was going to eat them all   the duke went berserk for your anchovy pinwheels   he's hardly the king though  is he   i mean  i've seen him coming out the bank   i wish you'd both stop fretting about the guests   from a service point of view  the evening was a triumph   is that really a trick off the liners  mr  p   spilling drinks on an unwelcome guest   it might be   you want to get some bread and dripping down you   i am off down the crown and anchor   would you care to join me  mr  pritchard   it's only round the corner  it's where all the servants go   thank you  i'll stick with the cup that cheers but does not inebriate     and so will johnny    he's been working since dawn   let the lad have a treat   i'm all right  i've got things to do   you taste like champagne     what are you playing at  ivy    you're not being a gentleman   and you're not being a lady neither  ladies keep their promises   where you going   he signed with an agency  that rents out footmen for the white tie balls    look who's come calling   yes  miss   i'll have a creme de menthe  please   in a lady's glass   tell you what  johnny  someone's making sheep's eyes   we had plans  i stood her up   stood her up  where   round the alleyway  up against the wall   orphanage girls  they like a bit of loving   speak from knowledge  do you   well  i'll tell you what   the girl looks game enough   johnny  what's got into you   don't move  don't move   get a cloth  someone   i got it  mate  you'll be all right  i got it   johnny   johnny  you're making matters worse   i've been sick  miss buck   pull the chain on it  you don't want it looking at you   johnny  you're going to have to come out   i can't come out   can you come in   i'm on probation  miss buck   on probation here   on probation from the courts   i was done for brawling in the village   i'm like that when i'm in drink   they bound me over to keep the peace   they said i had to live away from home   i've been seeing my probation officer every week   why was nothing said   this was my fresh start   my clean sheet  i had no past in this house   i'm sorry   i'm sorry  miss buck   come on  johnny  one foot in front of the other   left  right  left  right     johnny has been remanded in custody   he will be charged with wounding with intent   well  it's almost unfortunate   you'll have to pour your own coffee   miss buck hasn't been in to reorganise the servants   and agnes seems incapable of doing so herself   agnes is occupied writing to john's mother   rearrange the words in this sentence   door  stable  bolted  after  horse   i will not have agnes blamed for last night's horrible fiasco   she's not the one who invited bloody ribbentrop   i didn't invite ribbentrop   i did invite mrs  simpson  and she clearly used me   but neither of them brought the police force to your door   what would father have done  in a situation of this nature   he was never in a situation of this nature   your father  hallam  left everything to me   i find it such a help to gaze on water during awkward conversations   i had a lily pond made behind our house in delhi   my marriage endured as a direct consequence   i hope i haven't embarrassed you   i do realise i've been extremely complimentary   you caught me unawares  lady holland   my ends are entirely selfish   sir hallam needs you to stay on at eaton place  to ensure the proper running of his home   i told him i would arrange it   and no mother likes to disappoint her only child   lady agnes didn't want a housekeeper  and certainly not me   she doubtless thought you were ready to be put out to grass   i daresay she thinks the same of me   but we have experience  you and i   we are what that house requires   i should have asked more questions   i wanted instant staff at an ideal price   and never once stopped to think where that might lead us   it's not just the staff who need training  miss buck   please don't get up and make tea   if you make tea  you'll have time to think  and i don't want you to think   i just want you to say yes   begging your pardon  my lady  i can't accept your offer   it's already been made to me         by lady holland   come now  we have cried enough   this is for you   welcome home   he's doing it again   he's caressing that cherry with his eyes   i think lady agnes would be very embarrassed  if i cleaned up her sick   go out and get swabbing   darling  you must see a doctor   we must take the best advice   miss buck says you sailed from hamburg overnight   that's not a voyage  that's an ordeal   you told me to think  maud   you didn't say i had to think like you   send the foolish girl to bed   i will send my sister to bed when i'm good and ready   mosley's going to break down barriers and class   i'm glad   i despise the rich   somebody come to our bedroom    e mail subtitling bbc co uk
