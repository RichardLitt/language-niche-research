   1 lucky is the boy who grows up in a house full of the fairer sex  for he will have an early insight in to the mysterious ways of the woman   he'll learn cool make up tips   enjoy school princess martina   martin  get up for school   general bathroom etiquette   fidelma  c'mon  i'm shitting   as well as fashion and style   you're late   they're soggy   they were crispy ten minutes ago   but although this early education did leave martin  very at ease with speaking with girls outside the home     yeah  frosties on the go again ladies  what can i say   they're grrrrreat   it did create some jealousy amongst other alpha males   hey beautiful   hey   alan   do you really want to hurt me   yes  a strong tune  tony    good morning martin  morning padraic   ooh  la la   why is everyone acting so weird   well  we're at the point when adolescence and manhood are fighting  for supremacy in our ever changing boy vessels     i mean today  why is everyone acting so weird to me today   probably because you're wearing make up   what  alright madonna   aaaah     i kinda like it        where's me jumper     sultans of ping fc      dancing in the disco      bumper to bumper      wait a minute      where's me jumper       where's me jumper  where's me jumper       where's me jumper       where's me jumper  oh no        and the police are making no attempt to stop people  as they scale the wall  i have never witnessed     big week  it is  i've got my first weight wishers class on friday   oh right  yeah  good for you   yeah  it's all change   ah yeah  sure no harm i suppose   i'm sorry  what   i could probably do with cutting out a few rashers myself   liam  i'm not doing the bloody class   i'm going to be a weight wishers instructor   that's right  i told you about it   i know you did   we had a lengthy conversation about it   to which i was listening to every word   you're taking a course or you've got your name down for a certificate   alright liam  that'll do   debs  i tried  you did   look i know everybody's giving you a hard time  but i'd just like you to know i wish you all the best of luck  with being gay  no  no  this is all just a big misunder     shhhh  shut up pet shop boys   every other sign in town has an apostrophe on it  liam   the thing is  that makes it a possessive noun  tony   a wha'  like it belongs to someone called bed  as in mr bed's beds  sure  they're my beds   i'm not trying to short change you tony   i have a spare apostrophe here i'm more than happy  to bring down to you  it's just it doesn't really belong in the sign   i mean beds is just beds   no now  liam  i won't be having that  they are not just beds   little something for sir   has this been through the wash   don't pretend you care   sure  no one's coming in to the shop  because they think i've shrimped on the sign  ok   alright  b e d apostrophe s   i'll see you then tony  with a full stop     but mam  she put make up on me   she was probably just trying to spruce you up a bit   she wasn't doing it to be nice  mam   she was doing it to be mean   she took advantage of me when she knew the wits about me were sleepy   she's evil  that girl  pure evil   like  er     like skeletor   ah  here we go    shh  hi there   my name's jennifer bakewell   i'm your weight wishers instructors instructor   so it's like weight watchers yeah   well  more competitively priced though   ooohh   what are you talking about   my new career   food   what's it all about   how can something so delicious make us feel so very  very ugly   and fat   does dad know about this nonsense   yes  dad is aware of it   the only weight this family needs to lose is the ten stone witch  who shares my bedroom   look  martin   if you just got up a bit earlier and washed your face  this never would have happened   why do you need so much time in bed anyway  ah  would you leave him alone   sure he was probably just playing with himself   it's only natural  martin   playing with myself     how did they know i was playing with myself   whelan  staunton  dalglish    oh  and he scores   and the crowd go crazy  oh and he scores again   yes   since martin stayed up all night drawing and playing  with himself he needed to maintain the length of his sleep ins   but he also needed time in the morning  to check his face for make up   what to do  it was quite the pickle   the only solution was to somehow shorten his nine minute  commute to school   but how  and then it struck him     ow  me head   the wall     the school wall ran right behind the moone house   so martin realised all he had to do was hop over the little wall  every morning and he'd be in plenty of time   free of ridicule and rouge   now all he needed was a little support from his imaginary friend  to overcome his crippling vertigo   you think i can make this jump   i wouldn't have thought so   i think i can make it  i'm a very strong jumper   oh you're an accomplished athlete  can't argue with that   i just don't think you've got the balls for a jump like that   what's wrong with my balls  my balls are perfectly normal   yeah  let's not go down that road   it's more like an attitude thing that i'm talking about  buddy   you've always been a bit safety first  you know   take your choice of imaginary friend for example   what's your point  beard face  hey  you created me  princess   and i can destroy you like that   yeah  that gesture carries a little more weight  when your fingers actually click   point being  you gave me my name   sean murphy  an excellent name   most common name in ireland  but let's not hang on that   you also gave me my middle name   caution  sean  caution  murphy   as in  careful who you're messing with  fool  caution   yeah  remind me  who is padraic's imaginary friend   legendary wrestler crunchie  danger  haystacks    and the big man from kilkenny has got him down  danger   you hear what i'm saying   padraic would have already made this jump   carrying crunchie  danger  haystacks on his back  like a thundercat  no doubt   whereas here you are bickering with a man wearing lady's shoes   why are you wearing high heels   an excellent question    i am a bit safety first   and so it was that sleepyhead safety first moone  resigned himself to a life of mocking head voices   'do you really want to hurt me '  'alright madonna '    'i kinda like it '  or did he   feck off  wall   hi yah  yeah   lovely man your dad  huh   lovely man  terrible builder   it's not the size of a man's balls that's important  buddy   it's the direction they're swinging in    mr gorbachev  tear down this wall   i'd let him tag me anytime   you're probably asking yourself   aren't you just an affordable version of weight watchers   and in many ways we are   so she's up in longford now  ooh la la   living with him  most likely   like the manky cat that got the cream   doesn't care who gets hurt   slapper  d'you know   slapper  yeah   our plan has never been clinically tested   so it's fresher  too  and braver   let's start with the basics   why can't they just weigh themselves at home   but she'll get hers no doubt   probably in the shape of some unpleasant rash  on her undercarriage   mm  undercarriage rash  yeah    strip down and discover the hard truth amongst friends   but what can you do  she's me sister  you know   your own home would be an ideal spot for a weighing party   away from prying  mocking eyes   martin moone planned to remove small pieces of the wall every day  so that his clueless parents might not notice it  disappear from right under their stupid noses   what the hell is he doing out there       demanding that border guards immediately open the gates   and then within hours  they began to burst through the eastern blockade   wouldn't mind having a go on your eastern blockade   a go   you wouldn't mind a go  that's lovely liam   i'm working here   oh  yeah   your fat instruction course thing   i know what it's called   what's it called   what's what called   liam   what is the name of the weight loss class  i'm going to be an instructor of   the    no  you didn't let me finish   doesn't start with  the   fattest fools   no  greedy gobs   no  chubby club   do you really think it's called the chubby club   i didn't say  the    i knew it  this is so disappointing   what is  they all said they wouldn't support my new career   who's  they   and now you've just proved them right   i take it seriously   i am more than happy to starve the arses off the flab foundation   believe me   i am supportive i am   so we could use the workshop for a class  then   my workshop   no liam  the second workshop  that i keep in the back pocket  of my feckin' tennis shorts   you own tennis shorts   can we use it   deb  that's my place of work   and then  it would also be my place of work   yeah  but come on   they're not the same thing   meaning your career is more important than mine   yeah   right   weight wishers   wish away  what   oh  now     balls    the wall was first constructed by the gdr in august 1961   and was officially referred to as the  anti fascist protection rampart    you're a rampart   martin turned out to be quite a resourceful little runt   that's it buddy   just the right combination of destruction and caution   i mean what other man could achieve so much with so few tools     maybe there's one   would you like to dance   it would be my pleasure    what a knob bucket   so  ladies  what we have here is a picture of our good carbs   our bad carbs and our ugly carbs   now that would be things like spaghetti   french toast   we know it's french because it's smoking   some might say that breaking down a wall just to  shorten your commute to school is pretty reckless   you've changed  kid   we've all changed mr murphy  nice shoes by the way   heyyy   martin will you get up out of bed   who's in there   oh   well   you're still going to be late for school  loser   you know what sinead   if you spent more time on your own make up and less on mine   maybe you wouldn't look like such a scabby old spinster   in 1989  martin's favourite tv show was dynasty   ha ha   actually  i'm done   that morning our wall smashing little hero made it to school   after a stationary breakfast  and totally make up free   with four whole minutes to spare        don't worry  be happy    bobby mcferrin  so  the whole school's talkin' about your wall exploits   they've started calling you the dozy bulldozer   so    you're not doing the    make up thing anymore      no  that's cool   whatever   i need to go and do   a wee   with the fall of the wall   people began to pass from east boyle to west boyle with gay abandon   and back again with even gayer abandon    i'd just worry  with the nature of the people you're talking about  they may fall through  and kill everybody below them  you know  no  no  i understand   yeah  if it's a weak ceiling  it's really not worth the risk   i mean  it's fairly weak  and you know  they're big people aren't they   ok thanks   it's not like they'll be jumping up and down   and as cross border traffic soared  so did martin's popularity   hey wrecking ball   hey alan ball       i wanna be   a sledge hammer   oh  well actually i just used a chisel   but thanks  pal   love that tune   what the f      alright   you can use it   really  thanks love   rebuilding a wall seems like a job for a weight loss group  right   huh   turns out martin's parents' noses  weren't quite as stupid as he assumed   martin what happened to the wall   well i don't know   it must be natural erosion   like an oxbow lake   please don't compare the serenity of an oxbow lake  to your blatant vandalism   look mam  i'm not pointing fingers  or anything   but that wall was pretty shoddy to begin with   whoa  whoa  i built that wall   stop right there  what do you think you are doing   sure  this is public access isn't it  you're climbing through a wall   what sort of public access has a wall in the middle of it   good point   you really should get rid of the rest of that wall missus   health and safety you know  see you later dozy bulldozer   martin you need to make this right   this place is like a bloody dual carriageway    oh come on now   you need to fix the wall   i can't fix a wall  woman  i'm just a child   look     don't worry pal  we'll rebuild it together  the two lads  eh   butch and sundance build a wall   just like they did in the film   yeah   give us a hand will you   oh for fu     weight wishers  drop a dress size keep them interested   with the weighing space secured  debra hit the streets of boyle   spreading her nutritional gospel with her appetite apostles   like to lose some weight   this is a bit more like it  weight wishers  stop the weight   here i'll slip it in your pocket look at that   hey  how long has he been on his break now  an hour   unbelievable  butch and sundance my hole   yeah   well the important thing is that you're doing a really shoddy job   oh  the shoddiest  i'm hoping it'll fall down on the lot of them   this is boring  we're literally watching cement dry   you know what padraic and his imaginary friend are doing about now   no   neither do i   but i bet it involves sharks   and some kind of unicorn battle   it's unbelievable   why did you want to come exactly here to the brandenburger   well  a year ago we did  looking for freedom  and it was a dream   actor  singer     knight rider     germany unifier   i really hope he plays the keyboard on his scarf     hey  i wouldn't swap this for the world  though   you know  the two lads  butch   sundance watch cement dry   yeah  actually that's something i just do with my dad   that whole butch and sundance thing   oh  yeah   that  that  that's cool   right  it's just     yep   wow  now this is pretty awkward now       thought you might like a cup of tea   oh   thanks  love   maybe next week  huh   yeah   that thing in berlin is on telly if you want to watch it  mm   david hasselhoff is performing   no   oh yeah   the price of freedom   yeah       morning in june some twenty years ago     him being there really makes the whole wall thing worthwhile       i've been looking for freedom      i've been looking so long      i've been looking for freedom     you wanna do the dance again       i've been looking for freedom      i've been looking so long         they said the weight wishers class was just through     what the feck is this   so much for the short cut   we could just walk around the long way   walkin'  no way  jose   let's just leave it  will we   yeah  sure  yeah  that's probably best   yeah  yeah
