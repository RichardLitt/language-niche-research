care   if he meant so little to you  why the ring   i didn't know he still wore it  it was over a long time ago   there was a time when i thought     but then i realised it was just sex   ruairi wanted me for sex  mr      gently   gently   a wonderful name for a lover   a lot of men want me for sex  mr gently     do you find that surprising   when did you last see him   last week   i hate you  ruairi   one more time   make me feel good   i like sex  mr gently  don't you   i'd like you to come down to the station and make a statement on the record   i'll need a few minutes   you know any good pubs   i     so     how is gg these days   still the pillar of rectitude   well  yeah he is     hey  where d'you learn to play like that  the east end   i went undercover for six months infiltrating a protection racket  really  yeah   wow   even with that accent  oh  don't be fooled   i was born in the gutter   you see this man because this is the man i want people to see   mrs lane   like what you see   get dressed  will you   you don't like what you see   mrs lane    you're lonely  aren't you   i know men   i can read them like a book   you're lonely  like i am   you're married  is that the problem   she died   mr gently  what   how did ruairi die  he was shot   and then somebody poured petrol over his body and set light to it   she sobs  i'm sorry   what about you   what's a smart guy like you doing stuck here   well   waiting for a better offer  really   we should talk   maybe i can help   me   in special branch   even with my great undercover skills   i'm afraid you owe me another large one   two more  barman  no problem   any unexplained bodies turned up recently  john   i can't     quite right  you keep shtum   you did what   it was just a game of darts    it seemed like the best plan   what did you talk to him about  nothing   his work  you  me   not really   what did he ask you  what did he ask you about   erm    he asked about dead bodies   and you told him to mind his own business   i don't see it matters  he's a policeman   oh  this is funny  this is funny   what's funny  it's funny that you don't look stupid   why exactly are you in such a paddy  has something happened   wanda lane is in the interview room   it appears that the dead man answered to the name of ruairi o'connell   i want you to take a statement from her   have another officer present  preferably female   what about you   i want you to do it   find out all you can about her and about him  he was irish  find out how irish   find out if he's political   you mean ira   there must be a reason that empton's here    it's not a coincidence   do you think she killed him  i don't know   but where you gonna be  sir  you said to tell you straightaway of any missing person reports   bloke called o'shaughnessy hasn't shown up at work or home for 36 hours now  o'shaughnessy  yes  sir   his daughter's at the front desk  where does he work  raf huxford  sir  ah    bring her in   mrs lane  i'm detective sergeant bacchus   i'm going to be taking a statement from you about ruairi o'connell   where's mr gently   he's busy   so what's your name   i've just told you my name  no  your first name  you can call me wanda   mrs lane  i'm questioning you about a murder  not asking you on a date   you have very bad manners  like a lot of young chaps these days   right   talk to me about ruairi o'connell   time's come for me to disappear   i'm going to america   he was a customer   d'you give all your customers eternity rings  mrs lane   only the nice ones   what's in the box   something i need to leave here for a few days   why leave it here  because i know i can trust you   put it somewhere safe   a man's been shot and burned  but you don't seem bothered   mr bacchus   you don't know what i think or feel   what did he do for a living   he drove a van   delivering things  long distance   who did he work for   a man called alan madsen  arrow auto deliveries   and where can i find him   in the phone book   so the last time you saw your father was when he left for work  at raf huxford on saturday   the day before yesterday   has he gone missing before  no   and he reached raf huxford   yeah   and he went for a drink in the mess afterwards  but he didn't come home   i think something's happened to him   don't worry too much just yet  most missing persons turn up   does he have a friend called ruairi o'connell   no   do you know a man by that name   no   well  i work in the irish club   i think there might be a bloke called that sometimes comes in     miss o'shaughnessy   i can't help you find your father if you lie to me   why are you asking about ruairi o'connell  because ruairi o'connell has been murdered   murdered   and your father's disappeared   it could  of course  be a complete coincidence   is it   and i can easily imagine wanda lane putting a bullet in any man's head   talk about a vampire   so she told you absolutely nothing about ruairi o'connell  no   said he never said a word about what he did  where he went  what his politics were     believe her  no   think she killed him  no  no i don't   i'll tell you why  right   this murder was planned   first a bullet  then the destruction of the body  why   i don't know  do you   no  no  if that's what you're gonna do   you don't leave the one piece of evidence that's gonna link you to the crime   a ring with your name on it  whatever else she is  she's not stupid  so   so did it ever occur to you that somebody might be trying to frame her  yes  it did occur to me   right     what we looking at   we are looking at raf huxford   why   what did o'shaughnessy's daughter tell you   lies and evasions   d'you think there's a connection  oh  i know there is   well  shall we go down there  then  no  i want to go to arrow auto deliveries first    hang on   who is it   nobody   radio  _   and a pretty face  _ and a ponytail hanging down  _ a wigglin' walk and a gigglin' talk    _  hey  what are you playing at    alan madsen  aye   what's this  like  we've come to ask you a few questions about ruairi o'connell   he's not here at the minute   we know that   do you know where he is   glasgow  why   doing what   he's delivering spares to some workshop   when's he due back   when he feels like it  why are yous asking  he comes and goes  does he   it's a delivery business  man   is he a friend  as well as an employee   we go for a drink sometimes  chase women     ruairi o'connell's been murdered   there's a sizeable irish community in the area  did ruairi spend much time among them   he drank in the irish club sometimes   so did i and i'm not a paddy   i just like the music   no special friends there  no   no  ruairi was a loner   where did he live   well  you're going to find this hard to believe     but i don't know where ruairi lives   lived   yeah  you're right  i do find that hard to believe  after a night at the irish club  where did he go   he'd drop me off and disappear   you never asked him   you didn't ask ruairi questions  this is bullshit   where did the taxman think he lived  here  maybe  with me  here   i don't think the taxman knew much about ruairi   tax evasion's a criminal offence  pal  you're his employer    you're gonna be for the high jump if you haven't kept proper records of his wages  right   did he know a man called o'shaughnessy   oh  him  walter mitty  walter mitty   some pathetic flake of codshite that drinks in the irish club   tells people he's the ira's number one quartermaster   and   that guy's never been to ireland   knows the words to all the songs  though   know the sort i mean  don't yer   and they were mates  were they   no  you're joking  aren't yer   ruairi couldn't stand him   mr madsen  did ruairi have a gun   no  how do you know   well  i never saw him with a gun   he never talked about hav    why would he have a gun   this bottle of j40 oil  what do you use it for   i don't  it belonged to ruairi  well  what did ruairi use it for   greasing tools  i dunno     may i   thank you   one more question  mr madsen   how long have you employed ruairi o'connell for   two years   yeah  two years   right well  thank you  stay in the area  please  we will want to talk to you again   oh  no  no  no  i've got runs to make  hey   he's just told you   thank you   i didn't believe a single word that man was talking    when they gave you that warrant card   it gave you quite a lot of authority   the right to enter people's places of work  their homes  the right to question them     it did not give you the right to be impolite   and it most certainly did not give you the right to be a bully   you were very  polite  to wanda lane  weren't yer   yes  i was   yeah   very attractive woman  all right    very attractive woman   what does that mean   why didn't you want to question her yourself   how come i'm suddenly competent enough to take a statement for you   i mean  i half expected to see pigs flying past the window   she tried to seduce me   and   what do you mean  and     well  i'd have said yes   that was a joke   she's a bit too old for me   she's a bit too young for you   hey  sir   chocks away     bandits at nine o'clock  sir    makes aeroplane noises   pranged me bally kite in the soup  sir    it doesn't give you the right to take the mickey  either  sorry  sir   o'shaughnessy  o'shaughnessy    have we got an o'shaughnessy  rupert   yes  squadron leader  works in stores   never a flier  then  no  sir  clerk  ah  johnny stamplicker  eh   what's your business with him  he's been reported missing  sir  let's go and have a look then  shall we   shall i take them  sir  no  no  no  no  the exercise'll do me good   don't worry about this   lost an argument with a messerschmitt   me own fault  couldn't find reverse   i couldn't help noticing  sir   no aeroplanes  aeroplanes  good god  no   last spitfire flew away six years ago  we're being slowly mothballed   death by a thousand cuts   don't ask me who'll protect england if the russians ever arrive   no  we handle the raf's supplies for the north of england   we're all stamplickers now   soon they won't even need us for that   you see service  chief inspector   yes  sir  i did   thought so  podmore's the chap we're looking for   salt of the earth  podmore  where the devil is he   sir  at ease  podmore   this is detective chief inspector gently and his sergeant  mr bacchus   tell them whatever they want to know  sir   i'm looking for mr o'shaughnessy  can you tell me where he is  no  sir  when did you last see him   two nights ago  in the mess  sir   about nine'clock  this was after your duties were finished  then   yes  sir   and he'd reported for work that day as normal  sir   how did he seem   usual self  sir   go on  he got a phone call in the mess  sir   seemed to flummox him a little bit and off he went   any idea who called   no  sir   was he involved in any criminal activities   just answer  podmore   i don't understand the question  sir   well  you see  he's gone missing   i'm looking for a reason   no idea  sir   do you know what j40 oil is  flight sergeant   lubricant  sir  for heavy machinery  it is blue  isn't it   yes  sir   not yellow   so  do you have any idea what this is   well  that's a different oil  sir     that's what we use for     for cleaning guns   do you stock it   we've got a big drum of it  did you pour some of it into this bottle   or did perhaps mr o'shaughnessy do so   he could've have done  sir   if you lie to me at all  from this point forward  it will go very badly for you   he did  sir  yeah  i saw him doing it   did o'shaughnessy possess a handgun   say a webley  38   i honestly don't know  sir  but i can't think of any other reason why he'd want to fill that bottle   did he ever mention a man called ruairi o'connell   talked about him non stop  sir  said he was like a brother   used to bore me to death with it all  with all of what   all that bollocks about ireland  pardon my french  squadron leader  carry on   about how they were going to drive the british into the sea   it was just talk  sir   and weapons pass through this place all the time   all the time  sir  such as   at the moment  sir  sten guns   twelve crates  144 weapons   show me   they're in a secure room  sir   o'shaughnessy has the key   yeah  it's really secure that   i swear to god  sir  i didn't know  i had no idea     you're a disgrace to your uniform  man   have you finished with him   for the present  wait for me in my office   my sincere apologies   i will of course do what my duty requires me to    duty    it's a bit late for  duty   isn't it  who are these idiots   he means he'll resign his post   well  what's the point in that now   because when you're the man in charge you can never say  i didn't know    it's your job to know  he's a serviceman  not some oily politician   well  those sten guns could be in donegal by now   so could o'shaughnessy   so  what do we do now then  we'll do what i should've done this morning   banging on door  well  george  i knew you'd be back   did ruairi o'connell live here  mrs lane   why don't we forget about ruairi   we should always keep our eyes on the future  don't you think   oh  the young turk too  my cup runneth over   both of them   also look for smelly socks  shaving foam  toilet seats that are up  that kind of stuff  you go up there   right  you in there   you two in here    contraceptive sheaths  used or otherwise   what's in the box   something i need to leave here for a few days  at least i'll see you one more time  eh   no  someone else will be picking it up   put it somewhere safe   why don't you try them on  sergeant   you'd look good in black   will i be seeing you again  oh  you can count on it   did ruairi ever mention a man called o'shaughnessy   no   but then ruairi was a man of very few words  george  stay   sit   beg  kneel   here  now   goodbye  do you know who killed ruairi o'connell   no   can you think of any reason why anybody would want me to think  that you did it   none whatever  right  come on  lads   mr gently  you have a visitor   what do you think you're doing  questioning my prisoner   your prisoner  if you don't like it  you can take your bellyaching to the chief constable   the branch have got an interest in this case now   you're free to stay and watch   john   mr madsen is going to explain to me why he's been lying about o'connell  aren't you   i'm not lying  mr madsen has just told me that he saw ruairi o'connell at the workshop at 1am on the 20th   does that sound likely to you  john   he was already dead   so  why are you lying   he came into the workshop   started up his van and he drove away   why are you lying   don't act stupid   talk  hang on  hang on  you were where   in bed   in your room above the workshop  yeah   so you got up  you went downstairs and you saw him   no  i heard him   you never said  heard   you idiot   you said  saw   you don't get up when somebody comes into the workshop   takes a van in the middle of the night   we always do it  he had to have the stuff in glasgow for 7 30  man   what was in that van  mr madsen   that's enough   enough   you know perfectly well what was in that van   the question is who drove it away   and i can tell you that  it was a man called o'shaughnessy  oh    a man called o'shaughnessy    you know  i really do admire you local boys  there's no flies on you   although you can sometimes see where they've been   did ruairi o'connell get a visit from a stranger in the last few weeks   there was some bloke who came in to the workshop   he was looking for ruairi   what did he look like   tall   grey hair  did he find him   i dunno     i told him to come back at night and try the irish club   let him go   fancy a drink later  john   erm     i'm not sure really    well  you know where i'll be   you can go   i'm sorry   you didn't mind that   somebody's running sten guns to the ira to shoot british soldiers   i don't mind if somebody gets slapped as long as we find out who it is   empton knew about o'shaughnessy long before we did   i want to know how and why   let him make a fool of you  he's not going to make a fool out of me   i think you've got him wrong  actually   really  we'll see   i don't get this  why do the paddies want to shoot the brits anyway   catholics believe in a united ireland   we gave most of it back  does it matter if we kept a bit for the proddies   it does to the ira  yes  but most of them are in prison  aren't they  are they   why don't you ask your friend commander empton   and while you're at it ask him if he ever met ruairi o'connell   _ and when he came to ballymore  he stole the parson's car  _ and he gave it to the bishop in the town of mullingar  _ seven hundred peelers couldn't match him  _ the chieftain paid the army for to catch him  _ and when he came to dublin town he stole an armoured car  _ and he gave it to the ira brigade in mullingar  _  singing continues  thanks for coming  china   how's life  fair to middling  mr gently   fair to middling   the feller i shook hands with is o'shaughnessy's cousin   known him all his life   both born and bred in south shields   they sing the old songs  they even go around collecting money  for the boys over the water    but guns  i doubt it   this is fantasy ireland  mr gently   if you'll excuse us   john   how are you  glad you could come   if i overstepped the mark today    ahhh     gently's the kind of bloke that gets under my skin  he's a damn fine cop  i know that   but times change and people must change with them   here's to the war   which war's that  the war  we'll have to win against the ira   ah  right  the war the politicians don't seem to have noticed   did you ask about ruairi o'connell   he came in now and then  had a few pints   nobody seems to know much about him  mr gently   that's what i'm learning   he seems to have lived an invisible life   i don't know where he lived  i haven't even got a photograph of him   you got a wife   yeah  yeah   that was a pretty good show today   i thought madsen was lying   it took you to show me he was just stupid   see  i just think     what   i just think we should be working together   i mean we're all coppers  aren't we   the thing about working for the branch  john   when you first appear the locals feel threatened   why   because nine times out of ten they're little people   which is why it's been refreshing to meet you   i agree   we should all be pulling together  ok   i take it you've heard nothing from your father   no  nothing   and you've still no reason for his disappearance   no   did ruairi o'connell come in here much  i told you  sometimes   he liked the coach trips to the rugby   is ruairi in that photograph  yeah   they're all in it  there's my father on the end   which one's ruairi   ruairi's the one standing next to him   so that's ruairi   the one with his face hidden     who took the photograph   billy  the steward   so tell me did you ever meet ruairi o'connell   no   next question   well  in that case  how did you know about o'shaughnessy   how did you know about the guns   i can see i'm going to have to be completely frank with you  john   let's see  england versus ireland at twickenham  murdered them   them   the brits  i see   funny  isn't it  this   photo after photo but     ruairi's never    ah   got ye  ye bugger   st patrick's day last year   ruairi o'connell   that's him  on the right   with his arm around carmel   do you mind if i ask  is there some reason why ruairi o'connell has his arm around carmel o'shaughnessy   he's a bugger for the lasses  ruairi  well  anything else  just give us a shout   well   that's ruairi  all right   but not ruairi o'connell   that's ruairi macleish   ruairi macleish  the border campaign   the ira's top marksman   they called him the sniper   he had a sister   she was interned  she died in jail   story was she committed suicide  what happened to macleish after the border campaign finished   he vanished off the face of the earth   how long ago was this  china   two or three years ago     so two years ago  ruairi macleish vanished in ireland and ruairi o'connell turns up in england   right  talk me through it   i just had a few too much to drink   not you  the case   tell me what we've found out so far   oh  right     well  we know that  ruairi o'connell was shot and then his body burned beyond recognition   there's no luck with dental records yet   so the ring's the only thing that identifies him and that leads us to wanda lane   who may or may not have had personal motives for wanting him dead   he coughs  shortly after the murder  somebody drove ruairi's van away from the workshop   well  that's if madsen's telling the truth  which  i think he is   is madsen a suspect   he has to be  really   although  again  there's no known motive   ruairi o'connell could've been involved with gun running  with o'shaughnessy  and he hasn't been seen since shortly before the murder   making him our prime suspect   and that's the question    where is o'shaughnessy now   i think he's in the mortuary   correct   what do you mean  correct    that's what empton thinks   he told me last night   you were going to share this with me   well  yeah  if you'd given me a chance  sir  and ruairi o'connell  where does empton think he is   erm    what else did empton tell you   he     he asked me not to share everything just yet   what did empton tell you about ruairi o'connell   he thinks he's on a boat to america  a boat to america  well   let me tell you what i've learned while you were sitting there letting empton blow smoke in your face   ruairi o'connell never existed   the man who persuaded o'shaughnessy to help him steal 144 sten guns is ruairi macleish   hardline ira soldier on active service   but i suppose your friend empton never mentioned that  am i right   eh  macleish  what else did he tell you   nothing   i'm sorry  guv  i     sorry   why don't you think   why would empton share certain pieces of information with you and not others  i don't know   because his real intention is to blow smoke in my face  not yours   do you really think that he could be bothered to share one jot  of real information with a junior sergeant on a provincial force   use your brains  will you   ok  so what now   i need o'shaughnessy's dental records   get somebody onto that urgently   i want absolute proof that the body in that field is o'shaughnessy   can you get on the phone and chase o'shaughnessy's dental records  aye  i'm onto it   now  please   right  ok  why did you say that ruairi was on a boat to america   dunno     so he's either guessing or bluffing or lying  why didn't you go home  why are you sleeping on your desk   look  sir    listen  i do my job  and i do it well   well  that's debatable at the moment  the rest is my business  when you turn up  to work looking like that  it is my business   get yourself cleaned up  we're going to pay a call on carmel o'shaughnessy   why  because when i asked her about her father's disappearance last night she couldn't look me in the face   and she told me that she hardly knew the man called  ruairi o'connell and it turns out that they were sweet on each other   she's been lying to me from the start  let's find out why   carmel  why don't you tell us the truth about ruairi and your dad  carmel   i don't see why it matters  it matters because we have reason to believe that the body  in the field was not  after all  that of ruairi o'connell   look     me dad's just a little man who wants the world to look up to him   he started nicking things from the base   selling them to people   i don't even think it was for the money it was just   you know  he loved to be able to say to people  i can get you this  i can do that for you    what sort of stuff   stupid stuff mainly   who wants parachute silk  honestly   who wants a box of screwdrivers  drums of oil     did he sell this stuff at the irish club   yeah  sometimes   is that how he met ruairi   actually  he met ruairi through me   did ruairi ask you to introduce him to your father   yeah  go on  what happened then   that's when the problems started   ruairi had bigger ideas  i think it frightened me dad   they started knocking quite big things off  ruairi'd take  them away on his trips  sell them  then split the money with me dad   then  of course  he couldn't back out  he'd lose face   and he was in awe of ruairi cos ruairi was proper irish   a bit mysterious     did you find him mysterious  carmel   billy told me you saw the photo   and   i loved ruairi   i loved him with all me heart   ruairi seemed to you everything your father could never be   ruairi was the real thing   wasn't he  carmel   where is he  carmel   where's ruairi   he's dead  you told me so yourself the other day   where is he  carmel  he's dead   he's dead   did you notice anybody unusual  any  you know  strangers hanging around the irish club past couple of weeks   there was a tall  slim bloke with grey hair   came into the club a couple of weeks back   i don't know who he was   i only ever saw him that once   the guy that madsen says was looking for ruairi   was he asking about ruairi   he bought himself a drink and asked if ruairi was in   next time i looked over they were both gone   we will be carrying out further forensic tests on the body in the field   but i think you should prepare yourself for some bad news  carmel   see the suitcase  yeah  i did  yeah   what do you think   drive round the block  i'll tell you in a minute   she's making sure we're leaving   i think she's gonna run away with the man that she thinks is ruairi o'connell   ruairi macleish   i think he's faked his own death and left us a body in a field  with wanda lane's ring so that we identify that as him   so why wasn't the ring on the finger   because   because he didn't want it destroyed in the blaze   go on     meaning that ruairi killed carmel's dad   has to be  maybe ruairi thought that he was going to crack under pressure and go and talk to the police   because this is a man who's  one minute  nicking spanners and the next  he's gun running   have armed men standing by  i'll let you know where when i know myself   'roger that  sir ' you don't buy my story  do you   no   which bit   if the body's not ruairi  who else could carmel possibly think it is except her dad   are you telling me she's running away with the man who killed her father   what kind of person would do that   a woman   women are different  besides  who else could she be going to meet   what's the matter   i think we're being followed  or are they following carmel  he's gone   here we go   oi  aye  you stay right there   drop the suitcase  hands above your head now   would you like to introduce us to your friend  carmel   sorry  dad  they must've followed me   o'shaughnessy   he's innocent  he didn't know what he was getting involved in  ruairi was just using him   quiet  pet  it'll all have to come out one way or another   get down  dad   stay down  dad  dad   ah    sir  he's still breathing   stay right down   can he survive  do you think   not a chance   have you seen this sort of stuff before   on many italian beaches   that stuff on the back of his head   part of his brain   high velocity round  fired by an expert sniper   ruairi macleish  yes   which brings us to this   if the burned body wasn't ruairi  and it wasn't o'shaughnessy     who the hell was it  erm     i need to be open with you about something   empton  despite what you might think of him   he thinks i should put in a transfer for the branch   does he  yes  he does  and he thinks i stand a good chance an' all   based on what  well  he says     i remind him of him when he was my age   is there some reason why you're telling me this   i need to know if you're gonna stand in my way or not   no  i won't stand in your way  sergeant   if that's what you want   my dad died on the operating table   oh  carmel  i'm sorry   sir   mr empton is here as requested   fabulous  send him to my office   he's already in there  sir   well  you made a right balls up of that  didn't you  gently   our only witness  dead   splendid work   you'd better start talking to me   yes  you're right   i can see the time has come for me to be completely frank with you   if i tell you a story about john bull in his glory   will you promise not to speak in the middle of it   the situation in the six counties can't sustain indefinitely   the protestants rule the roost and the catholics live like pigs   sans houses  sans decent jobs   sans a meaningful vote in many cases   until our political masters do something about it   we have a disaffected populace that actively and tacitly supports the gunmen   men like ruairi macleish   oh  congratulations  you found him out   no thanks to you   good old fashioned legwork  eh   so what's the story about ruairi macleish   this is you and him   three years ago  you told me you'd never met him   in this job  john  you tell people only what you need them to know and only when you need them to know it   what are you saying exactly   ruairi was useful to us during the border campaign   very useful   we made some important arrests   he gave you names   yes  why   in return for certain considerations   money   not exactly  you mean you blackmailed him   this is a dirty little business we're in over there  chief inspector   he had a sister   in fact  she had no republican connections   but her name somehow got onto a list during the last round of internments  and she found herself in prison   i was able to help her out   no  you mean you framed her and then promised to let her go  if ruairi gave you the names of his ira comrades   but she died  didn't she   how come   well  she wasn't a strong individual   before we had the chance to release her  she took her own life   so then ruairi macleish disappears  why   did the ira suspect he was a traitor   no  they never suspected him   not ruairi macleish   not the sniper himself  so     still on active service  he turns up a few months later  in my town   where he goes undercover and eventually finds a way  to steal enough guns to arm a brigade of republicans for the next campaign   correct  you just happened to find him   sort of  how  exactly   the branch had a tip off   a phone call  who from   i don't know  it didn't come to me   whoever dealt with it thought it was barely worth investigating   so they sent an inexperienced officer to look around   the guy that madsen and carmel both saw   the one that found ruairi in the irish club   i assume so  yes   what happened to him   well  that's what i'm here to find out   so you've lost an officer   yes   do you know his name   you need only know him as mr smith   and what was mr smith hoping to achieve   well  he was simply reacting to the tip off   he had no idea the man he was seeking was ruairi macleish   we'd lost him from the radar   if this had come across my desk in the first place   i would never have let mr smith come blundering in   you'd have wanted to talk to macleish personally   i certainly would  the branch takes the view  that a man like ruairi macleish might rise very high  in the ira army council as time passes and the situation gets worse   now that could be very useful to us in five years' time   we would have made him an offer  what offer    inform on your comrades again or we'll turn you over to them    you could go far in the branch  john  with a mind like that   however  it wasn't to be   exactly how long have you known about macleish being here   not long  a few days  phone rings  i hope that's true   because if you've known about an ira gunman living on my patch  and you haven't told me about it  i'm going to be very angry   oh  steady on  old boy   never mind  steady on  old boy    you've brought a dirty little war into my town  and now two people are dead   i don't take kindly to that   three people  guv   mr smith  yeah   looks like he's been dead for days  doesn't it   what would ruairi want with him  why the beating  revenge   ruairi macleish always blamed the branch for his sister's suicide   get him down  for pity's sake   i'll make arrangements for the body to be taken home   if i were you  i wouldn't try to find macleish now   my guess is he's half way to america with a new identity   and the guns are long gone  you can bet your life on that  so     as far as the branch is concerned  this case is closed   looks like the paddy outfoxed us  doesn't it   this case is not closed  commander   if the burned body wasn't ruairi macleish  and it wasn't o'shaughnessy and it wasn't your man here  who was it   i haven't the foggiest  old boy   do you mind if we don't stand around like sitting ducks  sir   if he wanted to kill us  he could've picked us off  while we were standing next to o'shaughnessy   he's not interested in us   ruairi macleish has killed every witness  that could tie him to a criminal charge   ruairi macleish beat and killed mr smith at least five days ago  possibly a week   which makes it at least two days  before the body in the field was murdered   we still have no idea who the burned body is   but for some reason  he swallowed a ring with wanda's name on it   why aren't you saying anything   because i'm meditating  i'm doing that zander thing   zen  zen   and what  pray  are you meditating on    half way to america    empton said that macleish'll be half way to america   yes  well that's logical  we have no extradition treaty with america   there's more to america than that  america has a huge irish community   it has a press that can lend a very friendly ear to the republican cause  true  so   if macleish has gone to america  he could tell an interesting story  about his dealings with special branch   that'll be very embarrassing for empton   yet he doesn't seem bothered  does he   i was watching him today  in that forest  very closely   now you find a fellow officer beaten up and strung up like that     and you know what  i didn't see any grief  he used the word pity   i didn't see any pity on his face  he was relieved   are you saying that he was glad mr smith was dead  no   no  no  no  no  i'm not saying that   but you heard what he said   this case is closed   right  yeah   why  because he was worried that the body was mr smith   when it turned out it wasn't   case closed    for empton   why  ask yourself why  why was he so relieved   because there was only one other person the burnt body could be   ruairi  the body's ruairi all along   we're back to the beginning  no we're not   because whoever shot and burned ruairi stayed behind to shoot o'shaughnessy   so why did o'shaughnessy need to be silenced  what did he see   only one person knows that   well  let's go and ask her  all right   john  well done   we'll make a fisherman out of you yet   don't know a ruairi   yeah  well  you know  wanda   i got the impression that you knew each other very well indeed   he said you'd be expecting me   i got the feeling there wasn't much about ruairi you didn't know   that's the strong impression he gave   any idea where he is  by the way   he's dead   no   that's a shame   i knew ruairi very well in the old days   taught him everything he knew   ruairi had a delivery for me  but he never made it   you wouldn't happen to know where the goods are  would you  wanda   how would i know that   i think he talked to you about it  i talk to a lot of fellas  i'm sure you do  wanda   men are lonely  they like to sit and talk   i know that   but it's you who needs to do the talking this time   what's happening here  he wants me to sign this   i don't understand   i'm simply trying to make miss o'shaughnessy aware of her position in law  official secrets act   why does she have to sign the official secrets act   miss o'shaughnessy's father may have made her privy   before his sad death  to certain information which could be damaging to the security of the nation   this is pure intimidation  there's no legal weight whatsoever   and it makes me wonder what it is you don't want her to tell us   a friendly warning   you could be risking a long prison sentence   he was terrified  terrified   it's a horrible thing to know your dad can cry like a little bairn   he gasps  shut up will you  this do   this'll do   i'd never say a word   never say a word  man  ha'way  lads  you know me   you're a bag of wind  behave like a man   empty his pockets  here  give me your gun   hey  wear that for me  will you   you'll be a better man in death than you ever were in life  ruairi   step away and put your hands behind your head   what's this  sean   you know what this is  ruairi  say a prayer  i don't understand  sean   you gave the brits names  you gave them our comrades' names   who on god's earth told you that  empton sent us the photographs   that's why i was late getting here  we had to make a decision about you   photographs prove nothing   yes  i met him  he wanted me to betray the movement   which you did  for your sister's sake   you know  you should never have killed that special branch fella   you made your friend empton a very angry man   he's not my friend  sean   i said no to his offer   my sister's dead because i refused to betray my comrades   we always knew there was an informer   nobody wanted to believe it was you  ruairi   you  empty his pockets  you   say a prayer   didn't i get us the guns  sean  didn't i do that   is that a traitor  think about it   empton's making fools of you  let me speak to the army council   too late  ruairi  i'm carrying out a direct order   i'm to tell you you have to pay for your sins  you gave them names   why believe empton and not me   for god's sake  it doesn't make sense  why believe empton   just do one thing  give this to wanda   i won't have time to chat to her   you'll be wanting to see her  she's at a place called the rook   goodbye  comrade   he whimpers  you  have you got the keys to his van and his workshop  yeah   put petrol on him  all of it   are you going to kill me  just take me to the guns and you're scot free   man  ruairi  that you  mate   drive the van out and take it out of town   i'll be right behind you  so don't try to be brave   don't move a muscle  comrade   did your father hear a name   doyle   why would doyle need to go and see wanda   the guns   no bolts  he's taken out the bolts  where are the bolts    come back  you bastard   no more messing about  now   another man barking commands at me   you're just the same kind of shit he was   did you kill him  did you   stay where you are   stay  sit  beg  now    what is it men like you want   stay where you are  keep your distance  oh  you don't want me to keep my distance   i just want a closer look at your lovely   big   gun   well  what are you waiting for   i'm waiting for you to do as you're told   have you any idea how many times in my life i've heard a man say that   very well  sir   there's a box   thank you   ruairi never made it to america  then  no  he never made it   what a shame  i can't figure out what he saw in you   can't you   what does any man see in a woman like me   ruairi always had a soft spot for women   he was a good comrade   but then  wanda     ruairi never knew what a bitch you are  did he   clattering  pick up the box   pick it up   get out   lower your weapons   you make one mistake and i put a bullet in her head   understand   show yourselves   come out with your guns above your heads   do exactly as he says   give me your rifle   the safety's on  sir   throw your guns away  right away   get down on your faces   now  you lot out back  come out   throw them down   come on   on your faces   you  get down   get down   stay where you are   oh     look  i don't have any weapons   no  no  no  please  look  look   look  i'll prove it   see   nothing   why don't you take me and leave her   i can be your safe passage   no  look     i can get you through roadblocks  she can't   hand me the box  mrs lane   no  right  right     all she has to do is just hand me the box and     do it  do it   slowly  got it  got it     all right  all right   open the door   she sobs  well   that's what i call balls  you're a brave man  john   gently  miss o'shaughnessy   mrs lane  i presume   well  it all came out in the wash   sergeant bacchus gets a medal i'd have thought   and who knows  perhaps goes on to greater things   not quite everything came out in the wash did it  commander   why did doyle murder his old friend and comrade ruairi macleish  for instance   ruairi was an informer for us  i told you that   and who else did you tell  the ira  now why would i do that  george   to stop ruairi getting to america   where he could make embarrassing revelations about you   what  an ira man tells the world i turned him for british intelligence   embarrassed  i get a medal too  don't i  no  that wasn't it   the commander had a plan  and it might've succeeded  if you hadn't messed it up for him  sergeant   messed it up   doyle goes back to ireland with the guns   a hero    plus he's executed an ira traitor into the bargain   so he's a republican hero twice over   so i ask myself   who benefits  apart from mr doyle   these aren't issues we should be airing in present company  chief inspector   perhaps we could talk in private  we will talk here and nowhere else   i ask again   who benefits from ruairi macleish's death   i'm not with you  guv   your story about wanting ruairi macleish  to be your man on the ira army council  was all smoke and mirrors  wasn't it   you didn't need ruairi to be your man on the army council   because you already had one  and his name was doyle   ruairi macleish was loyal to the ira till his last breath  wasn't he   unfortunately for you  george  you put a bullet into  the head of the only man who could answer your question   you     you     authorised     doyle to execute carmel's father  didn't you   because he saw doyle kill ruairi   go on  commander   you look into her eyes  right  and you tell her what you did   things happen when people get involved in affairs they don't understand   when the  little people  get involved   oh  john  maybe you've got some growing up to do     and what about mrs lane  eh  doyle was going to kill her an' all   why  why did she need to get killed  eh  why     why  why  why  why    john  in this job  we don't bother so much about  why    we're more interested in  how   and  who    you know  perhaps it's a good idea the ladies are present after all   i don't understand   who  what   that's the one question mr gently has been too polite to ask   oh  i was getting there in my sweet  old fashioned way   well  don't take all day  george  the one unanswered question   mrs lane  do you know who it was who made the original phone call to special branch  informing them that there was an ira gunman operating here   all we ever knew was that the call came from a woman   well spoken   if a little brassy   men use you   men tell lies   sometimes a man can push a woman too far     i can't take you with me  sweetheart  you know that   you'll find someone else  you know you will  do i   he used me  and threw me away   mrs lane   i'll always wear the ring you gave me   carmel   you and i should have a drink together  don't you think   we can talk about men   well  well  well   a woman scorned   i've still got a few minutes  john   what say i buy you a drink   i'm busy   empton  i'll be making a full report   about what   about the guns you were willing to send to the ira   guns that would've killed british soldiers   could you have lived with that   if you hadn't shot him  gently       doyle might've saved hundreds of british lives in years to come   i hope you can live with that   and the wanda lanes and the carmels and the o'shaughnessys of this world are what  dispensable  for what   national security   or your glorious career   i was thinking  guv     what   what are you doing  i'm doing it     i'm fishing  why don't you do it the way i showed you   i showed you how to do it   why do i have to stand in the water   why can't we just stand on the side and   fish   shall we go and find a nice caff and have egg and chips      i've got water in me boot now  i'm not happy  this is rubbish    e mail subtitling bbc co uk
