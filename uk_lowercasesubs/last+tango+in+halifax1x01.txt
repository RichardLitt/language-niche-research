   1  i mean  i'd never have been able to bring him  somewhere like this  you see  your dad  no   cos he'd dribble   i tried to keep him neat   if we went to  like  the cafe in sainsbury's   i'd sit with my back to the wall and him facing me   well  i had to   it's off putting for folk  isn't it   they've come out for a coffee  seeing someone like that   you're feeling sorry for him  aren't you   no  i'm    yes  well  don't   i looked after him  and it's more than he would have done for me   i told you about the pension   yes   no provision for me  no   he were thinking i'd go first   well  yes  but    but what   it's not like you're without  is it   that isn't the point   i was an inconvenience for 50 years    well  he's dead now  so    you never liked him   god  i make better coffee than this in the microwave   god  these glasses are mucky   i've got a pen pal  did william tell you   no   this fella i was at school with   well  except that he was a lad then  obviously   i showed gran how to put her details on facebook   well  so who is he   alan  he was called   he still is   hang on  stop  start again  you     when granddad was    he can talk for himself   when i were at school  there were this lass  this girl     who he fancied  whatever  keep going   well  that's it  really  no  it isn't   put his name on facebook  right   oh  aye  that's it  and there she was  celia dawson   nee armitage  her and doreen wilkinson   yeah  just two of 'em out of t'whole year   you're joking  so  we wrote to her    we   granddad were a bit nervous   what for  well  i were in two minds   so  you wrote to her  and      and she wrote back   so  we kept it going   oh  it's all nowt   it's all nowt   we're just pen pals   except it's been a trip down memory lane   well  sort of  given that     given that      well  you see  he was in my year but not in my form   gran was in the a stream   and if he's who i think he is  then not everything he says adds up   you see  i think they lived up in the wilds  somewhere up stainland   she lived in t'next street   only he talks like he lived in the next street   and if he did  well     i'm beggared if i can place him   well  i were amazed when she wrote back   i didn't think i were t'sort  someone like her would remember  why   what sort's she   glamorous  oh  aye   she always seemed    a bit better spoken than the rest  and i     i were on t'shy side and gormless   so  where is she now   harrogate  she's got a little flat at her daughter's house   last time he saw her was in  yeah  her dad got a job down in sheffield and that were it   off they went   he was heartbroken  did she know you had a     thing about her   oh  she'd not look at me twice   i've told him  he wants to invite himself over   yeah  why not  say you're passing   say    you're in harrogate anyway and would she like to meet up for a cup of tea   your uncle robbie's here  raff  yes   half an hour early   want you back by five   no way   told you this last time  i made it clear   mum  it doesn't finish while five  how are we gonna get back here by five   hiya  robbie  raff   i want him back by five   right  no  not  right    like you're just saying it to shut me up    right    like you're heard what i've said and it's sunk in   right   he's got homework  i've done it   when    i'll ring yer        run for your lives       bastard   why don't you ask him for a photo if you can't picture him   she's got one  he sent one  on the e mail   only i'm none the wiser  as folk change so much  don't they   especially men   that's john's car    dad's here   hi  hello   i let myself in  so i see   hi  will   i'm off upstairs   didn't know you had a key   do you want it back   either way   how's your mother   fine  good   why are you here   do you want to give us a few minutes  sure   um    i'm tempted to say it's a long story  but it isn't really   in fact  it's pretty straightforward   turns out     judith's a bit of an alcoholic   i knew she had a significant relationship with the stuff   i knew she liked a drink  but  um   yeah     didn't realise the extent of it   has she tried to get help  oh  yeah  more than once   i don't think it's something that'll sort itself out overnight   well  if ever  in fact  so     yeah   so  how does this involve me   i've made a terrible mistake  caroline   oh  i see   you want to come back   what do you think   i don't know  i was dazzled   it's pathetic  isn't it   even more so when you see what a ridiculous empty headed mess she     sorry  you don't want to hear this   that's so selfish   out of necessity  i suppose   you can't imagine it until you've     sorry   i suppose i never have   seen it before  up close   the real mccoy   and it's only now i realise     how much of a fool i've made of myself   and to have thrown away all this here with you and the boys   and for what   it's appalling   it's abysmal  it's unthinkable    i am planning a trip up to skipton next week    possibly monday     if you fancied meeting up for a coffee    it would be a wonderful opportunity to      would you fancy meeting up for a coffee       a cup of coffee    i appreciate that you probably have much more interesting things to do         that you may already have your week planned         but if you did happen to be available         free         it would be very nice to see you     with very best wishes      best wishes  alan    hello   alan  it's robbie   lad's come off his bike  is gillian there   er  no  no  she's    ambulance is here   they're taking him to t'princess royal   shall i see you there  then  or what   yeah  but what's he done   i dunno  he's     well  he's conscious now  anyway  so     yeah  well  see you there  ta   gillian   where is he  he's in wi' t'doctor   well  congratulations  robbie  finally got what you wanted   what are you talking about  oh  you know   this is what i wanted  him flat on his back in an ambulance  you love  that every saturday i go through hell worrying about him getting hurt   i know you've got a screw loose  gillian  so i won't push it   but you'd better apologise for that  oh  yeah  that's happening  come on  calm down   i go biking with raff because he loves it   i love it  eddie loved it  it's in us blood  so  don't you come and accuse me     yeah  and if you hadn't raked up all that bloody trouble  when eddie died  nobody'd have reason to think you took any satisfaction  no  don't   you're lucky i let you have 'owt to do with him  yeah   well  you're lucky that you've not had him taken off yer   raff  lad   oh  god  you had me worried   oh  they fussed  mother   i said  i don't need an ambulance  i don't need an x ray   i'm made like rubber  but    nobody were listening   hello   john's gone   he's gone to fetch some of his things  he's moving back in   right  i've told him he'll have to sleep in another room   it seems very easy for him after all that he's done   it turns out she's an alcoholic   and he's just discovered this   after goodness knows how many months   he knew she had a problem   he didn't know the extent of it   he wants to meet me in skipton for a cup of coffee   oh  your  um     alan  are you going   no   d'you think i'm making a mistake   doesn't matter what i think  love    dear alan    sadly      unfortunately      i would be delighted to meet you in skipton on monday    i'll put the kettle on   just you pause there a second  lad   if you jack this in   properly  once and for all     i'll buy you a car when you pass your test   why   because that's how much your mum can't stand it   she lost your dad   she doesn't want to lose you   hi  lawrence  give us a hand   yeah  right   um  do you    really want me to sleep in the spare room   just so i know where to put my stuff  um     i've got the independent schools inspectorate coming in this week and     just don't push it  all right   kicking off to number  what did you say to raffy  hm   about buying him a car  oh     he does his own thing  dad   if he wants to be friends with robbie  fine  i hate him   dozy pillock   but     he's eddie's brother   and raff has to make up his own mind about folk   i asked him not to tell you   yeah  i appreciate that  i appreciate you interfering   i love it when you interfere   but i'm not stopping him doing stuff he likes doing   he has to outgrow things    naturally  and then he won't resent people   me   i'm meeting her   in skipton on monday  are you   mm   are you   mm   well  if she turns up  why wouldn't she   well  i dunno   i don't know that i'll have enough to say to her   enough to keep a conversation going   perhaps i should find an excuse  what for   i did ask her out once   did you   so   oh  she never turned up   i stood there nearly two hours  then after   i found out that's when she'd gone to sheffield   that same day  you're kidding   she's probably forgotten   that were a rotten trick   well  it might not have been  she might just have forgotten   if they were flitting  she'd have had a lot on her mind  and  er     well  you know  we were only kids  teenagers  so     aw  dad   well  you don't have to go   oh  i can't pull out now   and it were 60 years ago  so what   i thought the sun shone out of her   i can still feel that feeling i felt when i looked at her   you've been married to me mother for  oh  i know  i     i loved your mum   we were     pals   but celia     it were more like     i dunno   now heaven walks on earth   is that a line from something   probably  oh   it will be   shakespeare   one of that crowd  yeah        and closer cling    to our lord  and to his altar      morning        there ourselves an offering bring    serving thee  our heavenly father    from the dawn to set of sun    serving thee in life's young morning    till our work on earth is done       good morning  good morning     morning    good morning   oh  sod it   there's your tea  thank you   and your change  oh  thank you very much   alan   celia   how are you   oh  i'm    not so bad   er    how are you   oh  i'm all right  good   good  good   oh  that's  er     oh  i know who you are now   sorry   penny dropped as soon as i saw you   you didn't know who i was   i didn't for long enough  i sent you a photograph   even with the photograph  i was thinking you were that other alan  up at stainland   alan    robertshaw  robertshaw   with spindly legs  she laughs  had he  spaghetti legs  my dad called him   i don't remember his legs   now  you lived in the next street   i didn't realise there was a    confusion   are you disappointed  no   how was your journey   oh  it was fine  thank you   only  um     what can i get you   oh  she'll come over  only what   well  i didn't  um    get a a ticket for the     oh     for the car park   i didn't have the right change  do you want to go back   no  let me get you something first   then i'll     isn't it odd   things you remember and things you don't   yes  always   didn't you ask me out once   did i   mm  you probably don't remember   um     you did   oh  yeah  that's right   then i couldn't come   because it was when we were moving to sheffield   oh  yeah   and we went a day early   i can't remember why now   it'll be my mother not being organised   you go and get your ticket   can i have a latte  please   d'you know  it's ringing a bell   now you've said it  good   but you got my note   did i   yeah  what note   i sent you a note to say i couldn't come   i gave it to eileen pickford to give to you   eileen  yeah   to say i was sorry i was letting you down  but     this was my new address in sheffield so you could write to me   did you    oh  don't tell me you didn't get it   you didn't  no   oh   well  it's a good job you'd forgotten   cos otherwise you'd have spent the last 60 years thinking i'd stood you up   you go and get your ticket   ok   kate     kate   have you got five minutes   just take a     sit down   very formal   john turned up on saturday  he     he wants to move back in  so     so i said yes   for the boys' sake   when you say move back in  does that mean      i don't know what it means  exactly   yet   i'm amazed   after everything he's done   after everything you've said   it's mainly for the boys   god knows we see enough of it here   parents who put their children anywhere except first   they think they do until it comes to their own convenience and     ha     happiness   i don't wanna be like that  he doesn't put them first   yes  well  perhaps all the more reason why i should   look     i'm very     fond     of you   you know that  i just     don't think i can do this any more   obviously we can be friends   but  um     the other thing  it     it's not me   i mean  it's not not me  i'm just not  you know     ready     to go there   i've got 9f   bad luck   sorry   i am sorry   oh  god   oh  no  no  no  no  keep calm   can i have a packet of 20  please   how old are you   you know how old i am  you asked me that t'other night   right  can i see your id   thank you   you going up to t'white horse again friday night  this friday   no  probably not   why not  stuff to do   have you 'eck   that's a shame  cos i thought i might buy you a few beers   again   that's   6 30   oh     i'll be there anyway   if you're feeling    lonely   right   mind how you go   ooh   is that what you thought   sorry  that i'd stood you up   well  um    you must have done   well  i suppose i might have  you did   y    well     oh  how embarrassing   how sad  no  look  it's water under t'bridge   i think my car's    i really hoped you'd write   did you  yes   i waited for a letter   never occurred to me she wouldn't give it to you   'appen she were jealous  'appen she forgot   well    and i probably just assumed  you just didn't have time to bother writing   no  no  no  celia  i'd have written if i'd got it   well  that's the last time i'll ask eileen pickford to do anything for me   she's dead  is she  well  that'll teach her   d'you know  it's all come back to me just now  just seeing your face   i married her   eileen   she were gillian's mother   oh  good lord  aye   well  she was a nice lass   i think my car's been stolen   what   yeah  it's a blue vauxhall astra   sure  yeah   i can't say mine was a happy marriage  cos it wasn't   i don't say that to everyone   he wasn't

that too much information   no   see  caroline says it takes two people to make a marriage go wrong   i don't believe that   she probably gets sick of me going on about it   well  she does   she says he's dead  get over it   well  not in so many words  but that's what it amounts to   i'm sorry   tell me about eileen   oh  we were very happy   happy enough  very    steady   then she developed alzheimer's   she didn't know me at t'finish   fancy her not giving you my letter   she must have liked you   so  i've processed your information  mr buttershaw  concerning your vehicle   how are you fixed for getting home   oh    oh  i     in broad daylight   in skipton   you're joking   so  i were  er  wondering if you could come and pick me up   not straightaway necessarily   well  yeah

heavens   still  we've had an adventure   i wonder what would have happened     if eileen had given you that letter   we'll never know  well  we could speculate   i'd certainly have written   there's very little doubt about that   what would you have put   er   dear celia   i'd have put   thank you for sending me your address    and then what   i've no idea   we wouldn't have got very far  then  would we    i am sorry that you were unable to turn up    at least  however  i weren't left standing there for two hours   on t'bridge outside t'church in t'snow    as i might have been had you not

were gutted   oh  alan   and there was me in sheffield thinking you didn't want to write to me   ah  but you didn't feel t'same way about me as i felt about you   how do you know i didn't   cor     i'd been waiting for you to ask me out for months   years   two hours ago  you thought i was someone with spindly legs  from up stainland   i knew damn well who you were the first time you wrote   i was pretending   pretending to myself   why   because     i did like you  a lot   but i was never sure how you really felt about me   not when you didn't write  and     oh  well  i can say it now because it was 200 years ago and     because i'm shameless and     if i don't say it now  i never will   i was in love with you   right  statements  who wants to go first   mrs buttershaw   we're not married   got your text  yeah  i got yours   you're not jacking it in  it's like i told you     get in   you've gotta get straight back on   that's what your dad would've said  that's what your dad would've done   it upsets me mum too much  you can't live your life not doing stuff  just because your    but it shook me up as well  you're just saying that   this is about gillian not wanting you to have 'owt to do wi' me   no  it isn't   i'm gonna tell you summat now  raff  about your mother   about why she don't like you and me bothering wi' each other   when our eddie     when your dad died   you know what happened   yeah  ish   wasn't an accident  this is my personal theory   you know what happened  right  yeah   death by misadventure  yeah  bollocks   she killed him   make yourself some tea  love   there's plenty of stuff in t'fridge   i've got to go to     skipton   grandad's car's been stolen   tell me about when me dad died  what  now   well    you know  i    i've told you   not everything   robbie turned up outside the school gates this aft'   robbie   he said summat    weird  robbie's a mad bastard   d'you know what he thinks   yeah  course i know  he tried to have me arrested   like i hadn't enough to cope with at the time   look  if you wanna talk about this now  fine   but you're gonna have to come with me   ooh  it's hopeless  you can never get hold of her at school   she's always got it switched off   i've left a message anyway  right   and if i get desperate  i can always ring john   well     who'd have thought it   us here today  like this   were you really     in love with me   what can i get you  ooh  um     er     oh   what do you suppose a crappuccino is  alan   isn't that an f   is it  where  on the board   is it  it's frappuccino  coffee with ice   they've always to muck everything about these days  haven't they   still  if you're not taking risks  you're not living   that's what our william says   and he lives in his bedroom  so what does he know   oh  go on  i'll have one   well  following that impeccable logic  i'll have one as well   thank you   i'd forgotten you were a comedian  i'd forgotten you were one   you knew damn well that didn't say  crappuccino    well  people bother with you more if they think you're senile   i mean  look at that policeman   well  either that or they run a mile  which can be equally entertaining   were you really in love with me   mm   i used to think about you     when i was miserable with kenneth   i used to wonder what you were up to     and who you were with     and how different things might have been if i'd married a lad like you   did you think about me  when you were with eileen   now and again   see  i don't think i ever stopped thinking about you   oh     we missed a trick  didn't we   i can't believe eileen didn't give me that letter   well  we can't change it   it's    it's such a big thing not to have done   she must have known   well  you've got gillian and raffy   and i've got my lot   and i don't regret that  do you   whatever else might have happened  no  no  no  i i     course not   he says it wasn't an accident   he says me dad wouldn't have been that stupid   look     he took risks with his biking  right enough   but calculated risks  robbie said   he were big on safety on t'farm   yeah  yeah  he was   when he wasn't off his head drunk   look    he said you argued     all the time  yeah  like thousands of others   well  he said how  days before he died   you argued and told him you'd like to see him dead   did he  well  i said you loved him  and he had to shut his mouth  right  well  that's    good for you   then he said how most of what he deals with is stuff like this  domestics   what you don't realise    he said that every copper knows  people don't kill people they couldn't give a toss about   what you don't realise  raff  about robbie is     when eddie     when your dad died     jesus   it warped him   robbie   he couldn't accept it  he couldn't come to terms with it   he couldn't accept     it just happened   he had to blame someone   so     obvious choice   me   he said one day he'd prove it   he won't  will he   no
