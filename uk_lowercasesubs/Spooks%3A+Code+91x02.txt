'authorities have commenced the mass evacuation of london '  didn't anyone tell you  new world  new rules   vik  jez  report  please  who the hell are you   charlie green  he's the final member of field office 19   hannah is the best person you'll ever work for   you all live here together then  except jez  actually where is he   he's done his disappearing act  gunshot  hannah   interim team leader  i'm relying on you  charlie   hannah asked me to give it to you if she died   this programme contains some strong language and some scenes of a sexual nature    taps on door  oh  shit  i've got to go   we should go out some time  are we allowed   what if someone sees us together   no one will see us if we go out of town   what would they do to you  if they found out about us   they wouldn't be happy   it's against the rules  is it  shagging an informer  just a bit   so why are you doing it   cos you've got beautiful eyes   come saturday  we'll go out  get off our faces   i'll see you later   door closes  in the event of a terrorist attack  the security alert system will send  a warning to all phones and computers in the target area   the message will advise you of the best course of action to take  if you are instructed to evacuate     where have you been  you're late  i had to see an asset  where's the new boss   with yate  obviously not taking his new role lightly   it looks like he's been here half the night   you've got some pretty big shoes to fill  feeling confident   yes  i think so  i'll try my best   i'm actually more confident than that sounded   you have the ability  i wouldn't have chosen you otherwise   right  what about the investigation into hannah's death  any progress   it's just i was thinking there must be several lines of enquiry     it's all in hand at central command  i need you to focus on field office 19  nothing more   but as we were handling the initial investigation    this is how it works   central command co ordinate the field offices and handle everything to do with mi5 personnel   the field offices do exactly what their title says   they handle everything in the field   that's any and every threat facing the stability and safety of this country and its people   i think that should be enough to keep you busy   charlie  a word of advice  don't make me look like a dickhead     ever   morning  morning   don't mind me  i've got a few things to sort out  carry on   is there any news on hannah  erm  no  but central command are now in control of it   they're handling the investigation from that end   give it the attention it deserves   but aren't we going to follow up on anything  no  no  not yet   let's go back to basics   he sighs  what did you do  hannah   just keep me posted if anything crops up  ok   who's that  he's new  i recruited him last week   i'm losing track of how many assets we've got here   public address  no matter where you live     bleeping  'till the end of the month you'll need your kettle for hot drinks   'normal drinking water   ' communication breaks up  this doesn't look good   crowd murmurs  woman  oh  god   is this for real   if you're watching this   i must be dead   which probably means they got to me before i got to them     someone's just hacked into the alert system at bridgewater university  the shit's hitting the fan   this is a serious breach  only mi5 have access to it   look they've used our system to expose windsmere  well  it's not secret any more   it shouldn't be secret in the first place   the media are going to love this  it's all over the internet too   it's out there  how did they access the alert system   the access codes are encrypted  it's a secure system  was a secure system   there's been a security breach on one of our most important protective measures since 2012   tech think they hacked in through a wireless connection to the transmitter on campus   what's the range on a wireless connection  depends on the signal   they must've been near the transmitter when they hacked in  let's check the cameras  ok   right  i've got someone using a laptop near the transmitter   i can't get a face  here  i've got a closer shot  i've got a face   jez and vik are on campus  get it over to them   good work   shit  it's that girl  kate   she's one of our assets   kate  'did you lose someone in the attack '  mum and dad   and my sister   i miss them  i'm sorry   there's nothing  she's gone  she's cleared everything out   she's been burning stuff  there's something she didn't want us to see   this is bad  we recruited her   this reflects on us  when did you last see her   what   what's that look   i was with her earlier   we were here this morning   you are kidding   you're shagging her  tell me this is a joke   you stupid prick   what happens now  jesus     they find out about this  i'm fucked   you never told me about her  i know nothing about it  yeah   i owe you  you're still a prick  we need to find her   mobile bleeps  we've got an address for her parents  are you nervous   i mean  meeting your girlfriend's parents for the first time   yeah  that's funny   i need to talk to you about your daughter  kate   my god  have you found her  was your daughter in london when the attacks happened   she's listed as missing  what is this  have you found her  is this your daughter   who is it  we don't know  she's using your daughter's identity   she's pretending to be kate  what does that mean   it's hard to say for certain   criminals have been assuming the identities of missing people  i'm sorry we can't tell you more   thank you for your time   i hope you find your daughter  i've got a photo  oh  yes  wait   we've been to all the hospitals and relocation centres   but no one's doing anything   can you help us  please   i'll try   as the head of mi5  i can now confirm the existence of camp windsmere   all detainees are being held lawfully  and within the authority of the britannia act     charlie  this security breach happened on your patch   this is on you   we have a lead on a suspect  jez and vik are in the field following it up   so i can tell the head of mi5 that your field office is on top of the situation  can i   yes  good   what do we do about your girlfriend  she isn't even who she says she is   this is serious  she's using fake id  did you recruit her or did she recruit you   music plays  maybe you should tell charlie about you and this girl  you could try being straight with him   he'll shop me  he's got to prove himself  he's not going to put his neck on the line to cover for me   what happens if we find her  it's going to come out  she'll use your relationship as leverage   were you listening during training   they warned us about getting too close to our assets  do what everyone else does  shag someone at work   cos i've got so much in common with the girls at work  that's gonna happen  you think you and this girl are soul mates  she was playing you  you don't know that   ok  we tell charlie she's disappeared  she got the video out there  maybe that's it  she's done   she goes back to being whoever she was   is it real  it looks real   i was thinking  if we knew who they were it might help us track down whoever sent the video out   there could be a connection   just an idea   the mod's insisting the video's a hoax   there won't be getting any names  because that would imply these people exist   head of mi5    the video you have seen  supposedly showing dead detainees  is a hoax   they're denying it even happened   everyone's seen the video  there has to be an inquiry  they're covering it up   getting the video out there was never going to be enough on its own   it's just the first step   you're telling me our chief suspect is one of our informers   yeah  oh  god  then i'd say this situation just got about 125  worse   do we know where she could've got the codes to hack into the alert system   did she have access to one of our phones or laptops  they run the same software as the alert system   not that we know about  tech are working on changing the encryption codes   but it's going to be a couple days before they can stop her hacking in   so  we're drawing a big fat blank on the security breach  where are we on finding her at least   we've had no hits on the id she was using since the video went out  she's off the radar   she's probably switched to a new identity card  how many identities has she got   'we don't know who she is  we don't know where she is   'we don't know how she did it '  maybe we need to start thinking about why she did it   what if she is connected to a civil liberties group  they're more aggressive   nah  i think it's more personal than that   what makes you say that   just a hunch  if it's personal  if she's connected to one of the dead detainees  i'd say  she's gonna be really pissed off that we're denying they even exist  she's gonna want to strike back   you're right  it's like we just poked her with a sharp stick   so  what's her next move  any ideas  jez  no   yates made it clear that us not knowing things like that  it doesn't really cut it   i think we need to find her before she makes her next move  ok   are we really going to do this  we've achieved nothing if we stop now   everyone will forget about what happened at the camp   we have to keep hurting them until the government admit they did   we need to strike during rush hour   door slams  footsteps approach  i think she cloned my pda  that's how she got the encryption codes to send out the video   i don't know how much longer i can keep covering for you  just give me a chance to fix it   yeah  ok  thanks    rob  there's a ds phillips in reception for you  ok   sorry  we're a bit short on meeting space  what's this about   d'you recognise the man in this photograph  yeah  it's julian nelson   we were training to be doctors at the same hospital  i'm afraid he's dead   i understand you were working together on the morning of the attack   yeah  that was the last time i saw him  i heard later he was missing     it seems he may have taken an overdose   his body was put into cold storage with the victims from the attack   they've only just got round to carrying out the postmortem   had he seemed depressed to you   i don't know  no  not really   i understand you also knew mr nelson's girlfriend  emma  yes   we're trying to track her down  have you seen her since the attack   no  no  it seems like you're going to a lot of trouble for a suicide   we're not entirely convinced it was a suicide   what did the cops want  one of my assets got himself arrested  now he wants me to bail him out   muppet   hi  fancy a walk   where to  down the corridor   what do i do if i want to speak to someone in the military about the detainees from this video   d'you want to speak to them officially  or unofficially   i don't think they'll tell us anything officially  apparently  the video's a hoax   seriously though   we need to get some information on these prisoners   it could be our only lead   there's an officer  he helped us out when army medical supplies were leaking onto the black market   i'll talk to him  thanks  i appreciate it   i have to go back  so   d'you fancy walking back  sure   ok   pa system  24 hour cctv recording is in operation in this station  for the purpose of security and safety management   please listen for further announcements   phones bleeping and ringing  people murmur  pa system  this is a security alert   please make your way to the nearest exit and follow instructions from members of staff   alarms blare this is a security alert   please make your way to the nearest exit and follow instructions from members of staff   panic grows  'this is a security alert  please make your way to the nearest exit  'and follow instructions from members of staff '  'this is a security alert   'please make your way to the nearest exit and follow instructions from members of staff '  they gasp for air  who told you to evacuate  yeah  hold on   an alert went out at the station  the police are saying they didn't issue the alert     did we issue an alert    i'm still trying to find out   it's got to be the same as the video  looks like your asset made her next move   i'm getting reports of fatalities inside the station   the police want confirmation the alert is a hoax before sending  their people or the paramedics in   the paramedics need to get into the underpass  there's people dying   central command can't confirm if it's a hoax   the bomb squad are on route   what do i tell the police and the paramedics  can they go in   charlie     it's your call   ok  we treat the alert as genuine until we know for sure it's a hoax   the police and paramedics don't go in until  the bomb squad get there and give the all clear  we can't be certain there isn't a device   lift the road blocks in front of the bomb squad  i want them there fast   tell central command they need to figure out what they're doing up there   we've got the casualty figures   three dead  14 taken to hospital   walking wounded are being treated at the scene   the media are blaming us for issuing a false alert and we caused the stampede   i guess that's part of her plan  we've got to figure the next attack could be even worse   we need to stop her accessing the alert system  tech are changing the encryption software   then central command need to shut down the alert system   what if there's a genuine attack when it's down   how would we tell the public that we failed to warn them about another attack   maybe she wants us to shut it down  ok  let's focus on her   what have we found out about our missing asset   there wasn't much to find  she was living in london at the time of the attack   so we checked local relocation centres    a receptionist at wood road recognised her photo  couldn't tell us any more though   maybe someone in the centre knows her real identity   there's been a lot of black market activity in the relocation centres   could be where she got the fake ids   one of us could go in under cover  i'll go  is that such a good idea   she knows you  the people she knows might know you too   so how does this work  do you volunteer or do i pick someone     you pick someone    ok  rob   cool  sort yourself out a legend   did you speak to this army officer you know up at camp windsmere   yeah  but he wouldn't talk about the video of the dead detainees  i couldn't get anything out of him   that's a problem  without their identities we're getting nowhere   maybe the incident at the station gives us leverage   if that doesn't work  we could threaten him   i wasn't suggesting we resort to those tactics   it could be the only way to get the names of these detainees   it's your call   that's your bed and that's your locker  you need to keep it locked   i think a friend of mine might have stayed here a few months ago  i lost touch with her after the attack   here     can you remember seeing her   the receptionist thought she might have stayed here  maybe  thousands come through here   thanks   very nice  i struggle to hit it once   what's it going to be like when it's a real person you're firing at      you ever shoot anyone   you  me  before all this  i was a mathematician   not much call to be shooting people   i'm not sure i could pull the trigger to be honest   maybe if you have to  you just do it   i had a look at your personnel file   your background  the criminal convictions   it's all pretty unconventional for a field officer   they said they wanted unconventional   no disrespect  but i doubt you could infiltrate a terrorist cell   fair point   is there anything you want to tell me about you and this girl kate   i'm thinking something may have happened  just a hunch   if something did happen  i'd rather know so we can deal with it   better you tell me now than she tells me when we bring her in  i would've thought   if something did happen  how would you deal with it   well  i guess that depends on what you did   all i can say is   i'll be fair  how's that   i was seeing her   i think she got the encryption codes from my pda  she must've cloned it   i fucked up   yeah  that wasn't very smart   those people dying at the station  that's down to me   no   that's down to her   i signed up to stop this sort of thing happening  now i'm causing it   we're making this stuff up as we go along  jez   did you see me in there this morning   i froze  i was terrified   what happens now   you shop me  you can prove yourself big time  charlie scoffs  i don't want any of you guys running to yates every time i make a mistake   because you'll be running to her a lot and that's just going to piss her off  which isn't good   you messed up  jez  you learn from that   at least i hope you do   i'll do whatever i have to  to put it right   then that's good enough for me   i thought you were going to shop me for sure   there's a saying we had in the maths club   never judge a geek by his glasses   by the way     don't ever lie to me again   jez laughs  is there something you want   i'm looking for a friend  you seen her   no   i hear you're the man to go to if i need id   that's not my thing  mate   so who's thing is it  you know someone  right   no   you get me an id card  and i'll make it worth your while   ok  let me ask around  i'll see what i can do   thanks  i really need this and if you remember anything about my friend     this better be important   they'd court martial me for just talking to you   don't worry  we're in a cctv black spot   the video of these dead detainees  it's real  isn't it   you brought me out here for that   you know i can't talk about it   this is just between us   come on  what happened up there   there was a riot   it got nasty   the men went in hard   when it was over we had three corpses on our hands   i thought your officers were supposed to stop this sort of thing happening   your lot rounded these people up  no evidence  no trials   they take it out on us  what did you think was going to happen   we didn't think you'd start killing them   scared  17 year old soldiers make bad prison warders   we're doing our best   covering this up is just making things worse   your people wanted it covered up   as far as the mod's concerned  these men don't exist   military intelligence came and took the bodies  they're gone   did you see the incident at chapel street station this morning   the deaths of the detainees at the camp   we think that could be motivating the people who were behind it  maybe a relative  or a friend   if we had the names of the detainees that died   we could see if there was a connection   i can't  we'll only use the names to find the people behind the incident at the station   this isn't about someone sending out a video any more  it's more than bad pr  they're killing people   we can stop them   we just need the names   if they found out     they'd crucify me  i'm sorry   they'll do more than crucify you if we tell them you leaked the video  i didn't leak the video   i know  but i'm sure we could manufacture some evidence to suggest you did   you wouldn't  trust me  we'll make it look very convincing   he's been showing people a photograph asking if anyone knows her   don't get me wrong  i really like charlie   but you saw what he was like when it was going off at the station  he went to pieces   and if he screws it up  he's gonna land us all in the shit   give him a break  it can't be easy taking over like that   what  oh  my god  you fancy him  don't you   shut up  has anything happened  no   you know you have to report it if you sleep with him   nothing's happened   do you think rob will mind us drinking his wine  that's what housemates are for   i suppose charlie is quite cute  in a geeky sort of way   you'd definitely have to take charge in the bedroom though   i bet he hasn't got a clue where anything is  we are not having this conversation   rob wouldn't be happy about it   footsteps  shit   please  what is this  what d'you want   why are you looking for her  she's a friend  she's a friend   she says she doesn't know you  i went to university with her  bullshit   agh   why are you showing people photographs of kate richards   ok  the security services are after me  i think you work for them   i don't  i swear to god they're after me   i was told that she could help me   please  you've got to help me   door slams  door opens  what're you doing in here  get out   doesn't look so bad  you'll live   you should've seen the other guy   you mean the guy who got away  there were two of them and they had guns   that's her  i've got it  through rachel's contact i've found your asset's true identity   her name's laura daniels  that's her brother  liam   he was picked up in the security sweeps after the attack   we sent him to the camp   that's him   why was he picked up  he was laundering money for a terrorist cell   i looked at his file  there was phone tap evidence   he was a viable suspect   so  we know who she is and why she's doing it but we still need to find her  any ideas   the guys who grabbed me last night knew i was looking for fake id   there's only one person i talked to about that   you told someone i was looking for id  who was it   i don't know what you're talking about  mate  who the fuck are you   you can't do that  this is out of order  i'm gonna report you   where're you getting fake ids  i want a lawyer   billy  you tell us where you're getting the ids or we stick you in camp windsmere   it'll be two years before you even see a lawyer   all right  all right   there's a guy i know  does the clean up operation in london   it's not like they need their ids any more  is it   d'you know this girl  you've been supplying her with id   i need the names you gave her  i don't know the names   you fucking do   look  it's not like i keep records  is it   when was the last time you saw her  a few days ago   she asked me to put her in touch with someone who knows explosives   i told her  forget it  way too heavy for me   you told someone i was looking for id   this guy  a nurse  he used to work here  david something  i don't know his surname  but he asked me to call him if anyone was asking about the girl   call it in   kylie  it's rob  yeah  no  i need the name of a nurse   first name david  used to work at wood road relocation centre   right  i've got a david younger  registered nurse  worked there about two months ago   now works in the medical unit at camp windsmere  lives in the green residential sector   'i'm sending his picture through now '  hello  david   you remember me  i suppose you were one of the guys who dragged me out of bed last night   where's laura   we know about her and all about her brother  tell us where we can find her  why does she want explosives   what's she planning  i don't know  you know what we can do to you   why are you covering for her  i love her   you ready to die for her   tell me where she is  where is she   you know who i am  don't you  you know what she did to me   if laura plans to kill i can't let that happen   cos that will be on me and i've fucked up once  do you understand  i'll do whatever i have to   tell me where she is   ok  what is she planning   jez  where is she   jez  where is she   the university   right   rob's bringing the suspect in  jez has gone after the girl   she's got explosives   we think she's planning an attack at the university   ok  contact the police  the bomb squad and the campus security   get central command to issue a security alert  we need to back jez up   this is field office 19  we need to issue a security alert for bridgewater university   'this is a security alert  please evacuate all university buildings '  beeping 'this is a security alert    '  beeping  she's countered the alert  tell them to send it again  they can't  we aren't able to warn them   laura   put the gun down   i know about your brother   i know why you're doing this   i hated lying to you  you fucking played me   i'm sorry   it's over   where's the explosives   you let me walk out of here  no one needs to get hurt   i can't do that   you're going to take me in   i'll tell them you slept with me   it's gone past that  you killed the people at the station   if you don't want any one else to die  you let me go   this isn't you  think about what you're doing   you made me do this   it was people like you that took liam to that camp   you killed him   i'm sorry about your brother but this isn't the way   violence is all they understand   if the bomb goes off and you didn't warn them  they'll blame you   this isn't going to bring back your brother   he wasn't meant to be there   he's innocent  she sobs  they've got evidence  phone taps   that's bullshit   whatever he was mixed up in  he didn't deserve to die   we'll work something out   you're just saying that  i'm not   i promise   you're running out of time  you lost family too   you know what it's like     you understand   this ain't the answer   put the detonator down   we can all walk away from this     you don't owe them anything   you're not one of them  i am  i'm one of them   please    gunshots    we need to get the bomb squad in here now  clear everyone out  keep away from the detonator   you ok   i know you feel like shit   if you need anything or you just want to talk   i need to show you something   'if you're watching this  i must be dead     'which probably means they got to me before i got to them   'i believe there's a traitor within mi5   'i don't know who   'but i believe this person is directly responsible for the attack on london '  'massive growth in the production and distribution of illegal radiation sickness pills   '  those pills kylie takes  is she really ill   the radiation in my blood is slowly killing me   a policeman was shot in prospect towers last night   we need to identify this so called zero and neutralise him   i want to meet zero   military action on british civilians will not look good  people will die   i don't believe this   we're not going to die  we are  they're going to kill us
