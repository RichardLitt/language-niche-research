 tina screamed for nurse  but little miss nurse didn't come    she was out in the back room  smoking and flirting with doctor    the pain shot through her like a big bullet    she knew babies were meant to kick  but were they meant to scratch     no  they weren't    salutations  friend   i'm garth marenghi  horror writer though i prefer the term dream weaver   when i wrote  directed and starred in garth marenghi's darkplace for tv back in the 1980s   i drew inspiration from the dyke of my dreams   other times  i copied the plots from dead authors whose copyright had lapsed  bite me   tonight's episode is based on a true life story   so i banged it out in a day   i was told when i was 16 that my balls didn't work   they dropped  but they kept on going   and it was a question of having them removed or having really long balls   like marbles in a hiking sock   i chose the latter  and fortunate favoured me   because the day i hit 30 they winched right back up   the point is  i thought of myself as a freak  an other   for years i wondered what my goolies would sire   would it be human   thankfully  when i impregnated my wife pam  she gave birth to twins  a huge relief   but for years  i couldn't help fearing that one might eat the other   they didn't  which i put down to good parenting   tonight's teleplay is about others  or mutants   it's also about my own desire for a son   which i'll never have because my wife's too old   so here is my poem to the put upon   with interviews from myself  my publisher dean learner and the actor todd rivers   that way  darkplace will finally get the critical acclaim it deserves   savour    'i'm garth marenghi   author  dream weaver  visionary  plus actor   'you are about to enter the world of my imagination   'you are entering my darkplace '  cheesy '80s synthesiser music  darkplace  darkplace  darkplace  darkplace  darkplace  darkplacel  'memories '     dr dagless to ward b  dr dagless to ward b    thanks for coming  dr dagless  i thought i heard voices   locked   funny  i don't remember locking this door   and yet it is locked   screeching  oh  my god   look at the size of that thing's rod   gunshots  gurgles  not a word to anyone  capeesh   poor man  not only has he just been screwed by a giant eye  he's now giving birth   thunder  argh   electric buzzing  baby cries  baby cries  the actor who played that part was not happy   however  i had taken him aside that morning  and explained what was going to happen   i would keep the crew down to ten  twelve people   the guy in the eye was a man whom he knew and  until that day  trusted   i think that scene's beautiful   it's very sad that we had to pixelate out an erection   it's sad that people are too frightened of that   it's pathetic   we've all got one   i could have one now  you wouldn't know   i've not got one   'my name is dr rick dagless  md   'that giant eye was once a young man   'he was having experimental gamma ray treatment for mumps  'when the eyeball of a sex offender got in the reactor chamber with him   'at least he was at peace now  on account of being dead   'i couldn't work out how he managed to make another man pregnant   'i guess we'd never know   'you're not gonna find out later '  'i should have given the kid up to hospital top brass   'but it felt good to have this little fellow near to me   'it felt like i had a son again '  don't play with the windows   'reed hauled us in for the morning debrief  but mine were staying on '  'i was determined to stay sardonic   'but if they found my baby they'd probably dissect him '  won ton's mumps programme went west and created a horny giant eye on legs   did they ever find it   found dead last night  shot in the eye   good riddance  that's done and dusted  then   negative  sanch  it's neither done nor dusted   won ton believes the giant eye fathered a child   dag  any thoughts   i know nothing about it   besides  there are more important matters   for example   hospital bloody hygiene   the gents had a pube on the pipes   i found a piece of shit on the seat   someone'll have to pick the pube off and it ain't gonna be me   can't we discuss something more sanitary     as if your fanny never graced a pan    what's crawled up your crack   she has   shut your mouth or i'll punch your lights out   come on  liz  i'll help you apply some more make up   anyway  i'm out of here   not so fast  mister   where were you last night     nowhere    nowhere   that's right  nowhere   nowhere can be a lonely place     i get by    i've been hearing some things

the air's starting to stink round here   not from me  it's not  i just went   door slams  'reed was on to me  i needed to stash the sprog till the heat cooled off   'i had to get my baby to the staff room '   'a ttention all doctors   look out for a dangerous eye on the ward '   this is a defcon 4 situation   'i repeat  this is a defcon 4 situation '  'make up really is a godsend   'now my cheeks

psychic   'don't think of anything   'have a thumb of this  it looks like a tawdry horror paperback  'but it might just take your mind off things '   'r omford is the cruellest of cities   nice start    'beneath its skyline's tattered shards lay a million broken dreams    'this is good  i've misjudged the genre like so many '  'i'll find out what's going on '  i took those slides down to floor 6

 goodbye   'now she's gone i can think about the eye child '  'eye child  '  this episode is about my own desire to have a son   i have four daughters  and  whilst i don't blame them   i don't feel they're on my side   you think this eye child is linked with the big eye that raped the man in b wing   definitely  it's what reed feared   but why would dagless hide it   today is the anniversary of dagless's son's death   maybe he's using the eye child to fill a void left by his dead son   it's all i've got   we should tell reed that dagless is harbouring the eye child   aye aye  hey  this cat's got claws     everything's a joke to you    not everything  liz   i'm going for a shower   i'll be with you in two secs  you can scrub my legs   men   you'd better believe it  i'll phone reed   get me

i wouldn't even slap his ass   but he's one fiery dragon   trust me  it won't be harmed    lt  has a name  it's called skipper   rick  you've been to hell and back with your dead son   but that thing's dangerous  can't you see that   you can dissect a heart  but you'll never know what makes it skip a beat   dag  this is hospital business now   hand him over  'k ay   'kay   'kay   'kay

your peace   actually  sorry  dag  they've just asked me to move you out  so they can bleach the sink   i haven't acted since   some say i didn't act during  but er     those would be unkind people  i did my best   he couldn't interact with another actor   i've never seen that before and i've never seen that since   but i've just seen the tape and it looks ok   do you think that eye child took over dag's mind   i don't know  but it took over his heart   for a while  at least   liz and i are gonna check on him  see how he is  you wanna come too   no   hey   hey       it's my fault   i should never have let myself get this close again  how's your head   lt'll live  i've lost some vision in the left eye and i get headaches   that's concussion   there's some panadol in my locker     thanks    replace them when you get a chance   thanks  rick   she's a good girl  dag  you're too hard on her   i know   i just don't find her physically attractive   memories   they have a habit of sticking to you like     like a pube on a pipe   yeah  something like that   come on  let's get out of here  i'll buy you a drink down the drip   can i take a rain check  my guts are playing up   sure  here's a pound if you change your mind   thanks   are you sure you're gonna be ok   can i take a rain check on that   you bet   sanch     yeah   if you pass a postbox  can you post my pools coupon   sure thing   'i'd been pound foolish  i could see that now   'and that takes humility   'nothing could take my son's place  not even a pet   'though i would like a jack russell  they are clever dogs   'i thought of the good times we had together  playing games   'i beat him easily  but he learned something from each fresh defeat   'the one thing he could do was outjump me   'that would prove his undoing   'but i'd need a scotch to tell you about that   'it involved a hop and the blades of a helicopter '  the pube on the pipe metaphor came from a real life incident at dean's   all i know is  er     the pube weren't mine   cos mine are grey  or indeed white   so i can't take credit for that one   in the end i picked up that pube and it made that gents a better place   that's my question to the government   will you get your hands dirty or let things clog up the system    'garth marenghi's darkplace is a garth marenghi production  'in association with dean learner '
