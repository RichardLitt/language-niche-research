 code 9  a nuclear attack on london   in bomb terms  the blast was relatively small   but the death toll wasn't   over 100 000 incinerated   and many more given a death sentence by radiation   for some people outside of the blast zone  life continued almost as normal   but after the attack     nothing in our country would ever be the same again   british authorities have commenced operation sassoon   the mass evacuation of london and surrounding areas   relocation centres have been set up by the government in the north of england   for all those made homeless after the attack   from its temporary base in manchester  the government  have introduced controversial new security measures   as well as ordering a complete re structure of security services   why would mi5 be interested in recruiting somebody with your criminal record   your straight guys didn't exactly save the world  did they   i've seen the reports  terrorists are getting younger   so you're probably looking for younger spies   am i right   i was going to be a doctor  then i realised i didn't want to be a doctor any more   and what  you want to be some kind of action hero   well  now you mention it      protect my country  that's got to be what you want to hear  right   funnily enough  it actually happens to be the truth   i was far enough away from the blast not to get burned   but the radiation made me sick   i just want to help while i still have time   i know the security services have to change  i want to be part of that   make sure no one does this to our country again   contact

me help save the country   you never even said where you heard about me   i've had charlie tailing delta team  for the last few hours  which was kinda fortunate for them  really   the ops tonight show that our fears for the pm's safety are justified   and it looks like there's an attack team coming together   now  you did well tonight   but you need to keep doing well   so don't enjoy yourselves too much welcoming your new colleague   let's reconvene at 0700 hours  sleep well   night   ok  let's start the initiation games  yeah   got the blowtorch  i thought sexual humiliation came first   or we could go back for beers and you can tell us how you got here   sounds a much better idea  although i'm not much of a drinker  what do you bring to the party   well  i can prove fermat's last theorem   i'll get the party hats   really  look    charlie  this is the union jack challenge  you have to do it  all right   it's not that i can't do it  it's just i don't want to     come on  get some britannia inside you   come on  come on   one   they cheer  two   three   that's easy   there's my girl   how are you  hannah   dear me  bit of a comedown from thames house   oh  look  they've made a little diagram   and here we have a revolutionary new structure of field offices   staffed by new recruits  with only one year's experience   it's never gonna work though  is it   we know what we have to do    be out there among the communities  target the young   we're already making it work   oh  of course  loyal   come on  though   wiped out in the bomb   half the remainder migrating to the private sector   mi5's been gutted   what do you want  neil   i've come to offer you a job   is that really why you're here   come on  hannah  you're wasting your time here  and your talent   training kids to do the work of grown ups   by the time they're any good  mi5 will be extinct   you have no idea how good they are     anyway  time was  you defended the old ways   until i realised how good the opportunities were outside   that's why i got out   you got to that point yet   i'll triple what you earn   name your price   come on  hannah   you can't stay here   come over to the slightly darker but much more fun side   your three minutes is up   never say i didn't try and throw you a lifeline   oh  god  what am i doing   won't be the last time you ask yourself that   what were you doing before your training   uni   you came straight from college   well  i had two weeks in tenerife in between   not much experience working in a team  then   chess club doesn't count  right   how about you   previous career  i mean   police constable  i was in my third year when the bomb happened   mi5 were recruiting   thought it was my chance to do something more than catch burglars   although  i was pretty good at catching burglars   even if you do say so yourself   and what are you good at   ok  without wishing to come across as a nerd     i think that's exactly how you wish to come across   it's a useful defence mechanism   applied statistics  real world use of probability to forecast outcomes   ok  you are a nerd   and how are you useful to us   i analyse risk  forecast scenarios  outcomes  level of danger   life     life is just one long probability question  you know   you're in the blast zone  you're not in the blast zone   life turns on a sixpence   is another way of looking at it   seems we've got a good team here   esprit de corps and all that   strange  if it weren't for the bomb i might never have known any of them   jez  maybe     but i'd have been smacking a confession out of him in a cell   what about hannah   hannah's the best person you could ever work for   i'm glad you're joining us  charlie   oh  thank you  you're nice   i didn't know if anybody would be nice   i thought you'd all be   tough spies   talking like   spy code or something   we're friendly enough   hey   sorry to interrupt   you haven't  we were just chatting  come join us   no  it's cool  i'm heading back in   kylie says it's another drink for every minute you're out here  so     there we go  no  that's my limit   wuss   so  you all live here together  then  except jez   thinks he's too good for us   actually  where is he   done his disappearing act again  doesn't even say goodbye   he does that a lot  we reckon maybe he fights crime by night  using a secret identity   mrs linda cook   mr steven cook   sarah cook   weren't you here last week   i'm here every week   all id cards on display with the picture clearly visible   all id cards on display with the picture clearly visible   uh  i've lost my wallet   must be down your sofa   hand  now   last name green  charlie green   sorry about that  sir   he called me  sir   how cool is that   that's nothing   someone called me a  bloody paki  yesterday  how cool is that   how exactly is that cool   old school insults are making a comeback  which i find reassuring   you should explain to your mum that you find that term completely unacceptable   why do they do it  because they're politicians  what's up now   wait till you hear what central command have sprung on us   how's the head  yeah  good  fine  raring to go   how about you  on the pain killers already  no  i'm fine   the prime minister's visit has been brought forward by ten days  that gives us exactly     six hours   six hours to prepare  ok   update me on the dna tests from the club  have we id'd kylie's squeeze   yeah  but it's not good news  theo danakis   shit    come on   do what ever it takes to get that info   who is he  arms dealer   specialises in supply and disposal of arms for big hits   the broker and the hoodie kid from the warehouse   hospitals still given us nothing   flynn dixon got quite a whack  though  he's gotta be getting some treatment for it   i've spoke my assets  there's crackle about jermain lee arriving in town   jermain lee is one of the highest paid mercenaries in the country   so  we know of three of those involved in this conspiracy   kylie's little friend from the club is theo danakis  the arms dealer   flynn dixon hiding out among the fruit and veg  is the broker organising the hit   but there is no hit without an assassin  we must get a visual on jermain lee   the pm's definitely the target   it's rumours of a hit on the pm that's put us on to our targets in the first place   jez   go and work your assets   what should i do  come on   you can be my lucky charm   thought you were inside  does it look like it   who's that  don't worry about him   and don't look at him   he likes to fuck people up if they look at him   serious  jermain lee    the hitman   i told you  i know nothing about the geezer   you're lying     he can shoot the head off a matchstick from a mile away   we know that  obviously  what else have you heard   he's mr particular  especially about food   any other useful stuff  favourite colour  maybe   he's like  proper obsessed   only eats burgers like  and only a certain type   organic meat  cooked for x amount of minutes  no sesame seeds on the bun   see what i'm saying  so how much is that worth  then   we'll let you off with a slap   we had such a connection last night   i think we need more time together   so  in brief   who did you last supply a weapon to   what   ok  look normally  this would be fun   but today  we're in a rush   i'm gonna ask you again   and if you don't tell me  my friend is gonna shoot you in the big toe   was it jermain lee   who  you fuck   you shot me  you fucking shot me  in the big toe  yep  i did   sorry  it's my fault  i mustn't have been clear enough   you can't do this  can't we  didn't anybody tell you   new world  new rules   next he'll shoot you in the bollocks  no  really   you wouldn't  he's my bitch  he does what he's told  you're bluffing   you thought i wouldn't shoot you in the toe  look what happened there   so i'd take that into account when assessing your next move   it's a very simple question   did you supply a great big gun to an assassin called jermain lee recently   five seconds   four   three   two     danakis just got talkative   he provided jermain lee with an ak47 takedown sniper rifle   organic meat  cheese on the relish  no sesame seeds on the bun   i hate to sound impatient but could we guarantee the pm's safety before thinking about lunch   jermain's anal about his food   mr particular  my asset called him   and do you deliver yourselves  right  right   great  i'll tell the dfo we're following a cast iron lead   one second  i've got a take away company that has delivered a burger  of exactly this description for the last couple of nights   to a kid  no more than 15   the hoodie   from the food warehouse   the hoodie is jermain lee   one of britain's most feared assassins is a 15 year old kid with a burger fetish   let's find him  i'll talk to the dfo  let's go   hmm  dfo   sarah yates  director of field operations  hannah's boss   ok  does my expression say to you i'm about to pick up the phone and cancel the pm's visit   just because one of my field offices isn't up to the job of protecting him from a teenager   the age of the finger that pulls the trigger  makes little difference to the impact of a high velocity bullet    in 24 hours he will be in edinburgh   they seem quite confident they can protect him   if you'd stuck to the original schedule  we'd have them by now   if you don't think i'll ask them to cancel   a correct assumption  aren't we rather wasting time here   i want it recorded that i urged you to postpone the visit   do you know how many threats to the pm we receive   yes  but i believe this is different   everyone believes their fears are different   don't try and convince me to cancel the visit   phone rings that's not going to happen  take it   it's bound to be more important than this redundant conversation   you're making a mistake  sarah   it's on the record  hannah  now do your job   yes  it's rachel  we've got a location on jermain lee   hotel room  paid in cash  food delivery matching his tastes     vik's cross referenced the hotel cctv with a picture from the compound   which hotel  the laurant  on the square  which square  this square   it's part of the convoy route  lee's in the room now   he's casing the shot  dry run  i'm on my way back   you need to secure the hotel premises  discreetly   jermain lee is not to know we're onto him  we can't afford to lose him   phone rings  hello  'hannah  we need to talk  you have to listen to me '  i'm done listening to you  neil   'it's really in your interest to meet me again  don't just   '  stopped listening to you a long time ago   the fire escape stairs at rear   my colleague'll take you down the external stairs   in position in 306   in position   third floor secure   there's movement in the window of 307  he's opening the window   something's wrong   what're you talking about  charlie   he's in position too early  he's casing the shot  stay focused   it's not right  why open the window  if he's only casing   we're in the middle of a grab  i don't want any dissent   yep   it's charlie  charlie green   i know who you are  something isn't right   what d'you mean  i'm at check point  where are you  i can see you     hannah  charlie  status report   she's been shot  let me through  let me through   charlie    i've called an ambulance   stand back  please   rob  get out to her  jez  kylie  go  make sure you take him alive   charlie   it's ok  it's gonna be ok  charlie     excuse me  please  i'm a doctor  let me though   it's all right  she's ok   gimme your hand  jermain  listen to me   give me your hand   i can't      hold on   jermain we can work it out  we can work it out   give me your hand  hold on  hold on   shit   it's all right  she's ok     rob   no  no  no  she can't be   hannah     hannah     phone rings  ok   yates is waiting for us inside   the assassin fell off the roof while you were in pursuit   yes  we tried to save him   who hired the assassin   we don't yet have that information yet   we'd assumed that the hit was focused on the prime minister   we recovered hannah's photo and details of the square from jermain lee's bag   she was the intended target the whole time   yes   right   the pm's visit has obviously been cancelled   an officer from central command is coming to lead the investigation into hannah's death   when he arrives  i want you to give him a full briefing   no   i'm sorry  no   you're wasting time  we are wasting time discussing this   and we'll certainly be wasting time briefing another officer to get him up to speed   mi5 created this new structure   don't you believe in it   we can deal with this   all we need is time   how long  five and a half hours   five and a half  330 minutes   you sound very sure  i am   all right   that's how long it'll take me to find somebody in long trousers anyway   get on with it   oh  god   what did i just say   that's the director of field operations   hannah's dead and i just backchatted her   not sure i can take much more of this   just while we're on it  why not six hours  or  i dunno  longer   she wouldn't have given it to us   five and a half put her on the back foot   she was thinking more about the  half  than the  five    why would somebody shoot her   why did he do that   ok  what have we got  danakis     i don't think blowing off another toe will get much more out of him   he only supplied the weapon   to jermain lee  who can't talk now either   there is the other guy from the warehouse   flynn dixon   if he is the broker  he's done the deal with somebody   find him we can follow the money trail   we can't find him  that's the problem   you need medical attention  you can't check use your real name  they'll nab you  what do you do   we checked out other staff  no ids were been used   who else  whose id was there and readily available   the security guards  when the heavies came down  they killed the two guards   let's find out their names and go back to the hospitals   bingo  pete grainger  one of the security guards   went to a e last night then checked into the wellstone clinic   i've heard very good things about that place   it's the go to clinic when you've been blown to smithereens with a shot gun   gotta be our guy   fancy playing doctors and nurses   not again   i'm here to run a few tests   wait    what you doing  that's got liquid in it   that's all right  just relax   let the sedative do its job  get off me   good to see you've not forgotten your medical training   who are you  what do you want   get up  stand up   down there   i'm here to collect what's owed to us   i hear you're holding the final instalment of jermain lee's payment and i want that money now   look at me  you fucking keep looking at me and you'll stay alive  where's the money   i haven't got it  i just set up the deal   i'm not interested   i want you to go and get me the remaining fee   plus 50 grand compensation for jermain lee's death   what do you mean   lee's dead   you've got yourself in way too deep here  flynn   his target was an mi5 officer   they got to lee and they threw him from a building   and my people want compensating   but i don't have the cash   there's one number stored in this phone   you are going take it   you'll get me the remaining fee plus the 50 grand compensation   you run       you die   tracking device is in the phone   you should be receiving the signal   the rest of the team are en route for backup   charlie  will you stop bloody pacing    sorry  one hour and 42 minutes till we have to report back to yates   all units stay tight on flynn dixon   he'll take us to whoever commissioned the hit on hannah   we got trouble   what the hell are you doing here    getting my balls squeezed by jermain lee's people   they're demanding extra money for his death  what    we've gotta go back to them with something   they're not messing about   they say we didn't give them enough information about the target   who've you been talking to   oh   you fucking idiot   you've brought them here  haven't you   i've got a problem   mi5  they've come for me   get them off my back  i need an intercept team   target's in longford arcade   we play this low key  we can't afford any civilian casualties   we surround the target  take him when it's appropriate   this is stating the obvious  but it's vital we take him alive   he's our only link to hannah's death   target heading upstairs   anyone got visual   shit      do whatever you have to  just get him alive  we've lost him   armed officers  keep back   put your weapon on the ground   i'm an ex mi5 officer  you don't know what you are getting in to   we know a lot more than you think  i doubt that   i advise you to walk away now   place your weapon on the ground and lie face down   no way   oh  god      hannah and mayhew had history together  personal and professional   i know he paid her a visit here last night   you think this was personal   seeing as you didn't bring him in alive  we'll never know   i certainly intend to find out   this brings me the issue of hannah's replacement   rachel  she's the obvious choice   luckily  it's my choice  and i don't do obvious   then     no  no   i mean  i'm not    you need someone tougher   you stood up to me   some might say that requires a certain level of steel in the balls   the others    good  that's a start   referring to them as  the others    if it makes you feel better about it then we can put  interim   in front of your job title   i do feel better with  interim   actually   interim team leader   never forget that  though  you have a good team   i'm relying on you  charlie   what do you reckon   i'd be lying if i said i'm not pissed off it i can't boss you about   yeah  but you don't need a promotion to do that   but i'm not pissed off it's charlie  i'm pleased   better the geek you know  right   yes  but we don't exactly know him though  do we   if i'm gonna take orders from someone    i've gotta respect them   i want us to find hannah's killer   more importantly  i want to find out why she was killed   everyone involved is dead apart from flynn so i reckon we go back to him and shake him about a bit more   news came through while you were with yates   flynn's dead   topped himself before we could ask a single question   somebody got to him as well   every possible tongue has now been silenced   so what now   charlie green   you know my name   hannah asked me to give you this   she was killed today so unless something weird is happening      she asked me to give it to you if she died   that makes me curious about who you are  an old friend   i don't know what this is  i don't want to know   i'm just doing what hannah asked   now i have  i'm done    email subtitling bbc co uk  'authorities have commenced the mass evacuation of london '  didn't anyone tell you  new world  new rules   vik  jez  report  please  who the hell are you   charlie green  he's the final member of field office 19   hannah is the best person you'll ever work for   you all live here together then  except jez  actually where is he   he's done his disappearing act  gunshot  hannah   interim team leader  i'm relying on you  charlie   hannah asked me to give it to you if she died   this programme contains some strong language and some scenes of a sexual nature   taps on door  oh  shit  i've got to go   we should go out some time  are we allowed   what if someone sees us together   no one will see us if we go out of town   what would they do to you  if they found out about us   they wouldn't be happy   it's against the rules  is it  shagging an informer  just a bit   so why are you doing it   cos you've got beautiful eyes   come saturday  we'll go out  get off our faces   i'll see you later   door closes  in the event of a terrorist attack  the security alert system will send  a warning to all phones and computers in the target area   the message will advise you of the best course of action to take  if you are instructed to evacuate     where have you been  you're late  i had to see an asset  where's the new boss   with yates  obviously not taking his new role lightly   it looks like he's been here half the night   you've got some pretty big shoes to fill  feeling confident   yes  i think so  i'll try my best   i'm actually more confident than that sounded   you have the ability  i wouldn't have chosen you otherwise   right  what about the investigation into hannah's death  any progress   it's just i was thinking there must be several lines of enquiry     it's all in hand at central command  i need you to focus on field office 19  nothing more   but as we were handling the initial investigation    this is how it works
