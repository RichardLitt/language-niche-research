bletchley park  1943 british code breaking hq   diederich     diederich     millie   pass  friend   jean will have the vapours if she catches you out here     jean doesn't scare me    she scares me   those personnel reassignments we just got      how were they encrypted    the last batch   ultra  why   diederich     spill the beans  susan  what's going on   why aren't you girls working   sorry  miss mcbrian  but there's a german oberleutnant  whose orders were part of the ultra intercept  and susan thinks it's important   don't you  susan   well   i've seen him before  he's skipping about all over the place   maybe he's hitler's nephew on a sightseeing tour   why use ultra encryption on personnel reassignments   go on   lucy  he's oberleutnant dieter von diederich   any other assignments   oberleutnant von diederich   berlin central to  effective immediately   oberleutnant von diederich   clausewitz  effective immediately   oberleutnant von diederich  24th march   battalion transfer order   effective immediately   oberleutnant von diederich   all right   hitler's nephew doesn't get around that much     transferred to clausewitz    where is that   nowhere  there are no german towns called clausewitz   maybe it's a person  not a place   it's also a tank division   he was transferred from infantry to tanks and back again   which is as daft as someone leading the show jumping  because they're good at hockey   so who is he   i don't think he exists   i think he's a code within the cipher   code for battle orders  you mean   perhaps   take it to the house     but i don't think     you do think it's real  don't you   you don't think it's a coincidence   oh  yes  i     well  off you go  then   you've been ages  what happened   we had a bet you'd been court martialled and shot     well    we were right   it is a troop deployment code   the battalion numbers indicate different geographical zones  and diederich is the order to deploy   so now we know where the german army's  going to be in three days time   my cousin's in north africa   this could     yes  it'll make a difference   well done all of you  i'm sure   now  get back to your digs  get some sleep   shift starts in seven hours   good night   you know the map they have up at the house   with the markers for the armies   all those troops are on the move now because of us   not bad for a few ordinary girls in a tin hut   why are you laughing    ordinary girls    you couldn't be ordinary if you tried   when this is over  won't we have to be ordinary   i won't let you   now  shut up and go to sleep   itfc subtitle sync  marocas62  the bletchley circle part 1   mummy  we're home   and then mummy says   it's time for lunch  everyone    come inside    lunch at school was horrible   gosh  i'm sure it wasn't that bad   it was spam fritters and tapioca   snotty gobbles   i am going to have a lie down   i've also got a sandwich if you'd like it   oh  yes  please  and i'd like a chunk of cheese   and this is alvar lidell reading it   police have found the body of a fourth woman  on waste ground in north east london   the woman  who has not yet been named   was discovered near warwick green  and appears to be another victim of the killer of jane hart   patricia harris and sophie trent   a spokesman for scotland yard  said that there were many similarities in the cases  and that they were extending their manhunt throughout the city   warwick green  that can't be right   mummy  can we go and play outside   yes  of course you can   stay near the house  though   gap in the pattern   missed one   can we leave the table  please   yes  of course you can   how was work   gruelling  stephens is reorganising the department   so everyone's on their best behaviour   a lot of fuss and bother over nothing much   darling     you know the deputy commissioner  don't you   wainwright   i served with him in the royal artillery   i don't  know  him exactly     why    it's a funny thing  really   you know i'm good with puzzles and brain teasers  that sort of thing   i know you're the very devil with the cryptic crossword   and you know that these poor girls they've found   oh  sweetheart   why on earth are you thinking about all that horrible stuff   oh  i don't know  i do know  really   the first girl jane hart  she was a shopgirl in soames   right  you remember her   she must have served me a dozen times   she was there and now she's gone  i can't help thinking there    but for the grace of god     susan  don't be silly   look   these girls    from what the papers say  they     they weren't our type  not at all   out on their own at night   i know  but i couldn't help thinking about her   now i think there might be something the police aren't seeing   i think there might be another girl  a fifth girl  but they haven't found her yet because  they don't know she's missing   you know i'm good with patterns   you really think that just by listening to the wireless   you can tell the police where to look for a murder victim   oh  yes     timothy    sir     how are you  good to see you    nice to see you too     this is my wife    pleased to meet you   come   do come in   now   timothy says you may be able to help us   well  i hope so     may i    of course   your first girl was found here   jane hart  in an anderson shelter    behind a disused terrace    yes   patricia harris was found     here  also anderson shelter   this time on waste ground   er   sophie trent here  this time in a cellar of a disused building     yes    now  your fourth girl     i'm afraid we can't release her name yet   it doesn't matter  warwick green   she'd made a journey that day  hadn't she   well  she wasn't taken from her house  mrs  gray  so yes   none of them were found near their homes   so the man you're looking for  doesn't go searching these women out   he waits for them to come to him   that means the locations where they're found  describe a pattern that's defined by the killer     not the victims    i'm not sure i follow   i think we've probably taken enough of your time     i really should be getting to work    yes  of course  timothy   won't keep you   perhaps the inspector has a few more minutes   just to go over the rest of the pattern     darling      no  no   i'm sure i can spare another ten minutes   oh  well  that's    that's very good of you   i hope it turns out to be useful   it's    good to see you looking so well  timothy   thank you  sir   so       a pattern  eh    yes   what sort of a pattern   imagine you're deploying merchant vessels  to take supplies outbound from dover   let's say these are your ships   now  you hear a mayday signal from     these     three  that should tell you two things   well  it tells me i've got a u boat under my desk     yes    and     it tells me that this vessel     was either very lucky indeed  or it went down without a mayday call   yes  but no one's going to know for sure  unless they go and check   i see   i think you have a gap in your list of murder victims   someone who  as it were  went down  without managing to make a distress call   that would even out the time difference between victims   exactly   timothy says you worked for the foreign office during the war   yes  clerical work   mrs  gray  i'm not going to ask you to breach the official secrets act  right here in scotland yard  but     it wasn't clerical work  was it   and your husband doesn't know   this girl you think we've missed   how do we find her   you look at the other variable   location   so   excuse me  sorry     it's not a straight line like the u   boat  but  let's say it's a spiral  he's  circling out from somewhere   so we track back and we look for the centre  which would be here  in soho   that suggests the gap you're looking for  would be somewhere around here   why would he be leaving a pattern for us to follow   he doesn't realise he's doing it   people make patterns all the time but don't notice   i'm sure you walk to work on one side of the street  and walk home on the other  perhaps you think it's faster that way   he's doing exactly the same thing   he's trying to cover his tracks by moving around   but in fact  he's making the pattern clearer and clearer   if you know how to look for it   right   those hedges and down through those railway tunnels   thank you  jamie  onto the ridge and all this stuff here     here you go    thank you     anything    nothing  sarge   boys   let's do it again   check up there  all the way along   they telephoned and said you were still here   yes  sorry it's taking so long   they're looking for the body  you see   right   the children are with mrs  johnson   so       they think there might be something in it   sarge   got something here     bloody hell  barry    i know   all right  lads  that's enough     sarge  i found it    sorry  barry   this is evidence   all right  boys  that's it for today   i'm sorry  mrs  gray   my men searched the area  there's nothing there   nothing at all     you're sure  i mean  i     we're quite certain   i'll show you out   i feel awful for wasting your time   oh  not at all     take care    bye   there must be something i missed   the pattern is there   maybe i was wrong about it being a spiral   maybe it's more like concentric circles    and he's moving      oh  susan     i'm just saying     stop it     look  i tried  we tried    yes   look  i     you know they're reorganising the department   well  transport's coming up in the world  and i may very well see my way clear to a promotion   it's just     anyone can make a mistake  susan   but let's just leave it at that  shall we   yes   of course   i'll buy you a new book of puzzles   i'll buy you the hardest puzzles i can find   coming   who is it     it's susan    susan who   hello   bloody hell     thanks  frank    all right  darling   you stopped sending the postcards   what was the point  you weren't coming   the last one was from africa  where else did you go   all the places we talked about   was it how we thought   a big adventure  you mean   yes  yes  it was   until the money ran out   it wasn't such an adventure after that   so what's his name   timothy   he works for the department of transport   he's nice  actually  you'd like him   we think he might get a promotion   so you met timothy and you fell pregnant   there you go  your own big adventure   yes  we have a girl and a boy  claire and sam     you    no  no       that must keep you busy    yes  it does  rather   balancing books  making the meat last the week   keeping the house clean       cooking      why are you here  susan   so they looked and they didn't find anything   no   i bet you felt like a fool   all right  but we're gonna need help   why   i thought if it's just something i'm missing  then you and i    could look at the pattern     oh  susan  if this pattern  of yours was easy to find  you'd have found it by now   suppose you're right and  this man is leaving some sort of a trail   then this is going to come down to geography and data   so    you're good with patterns  i'm all right with maps  that's a start   but there's going to be a ton of data  and how are you going to know what's relevant and what isn't   you need someone who can remember it all   and that means lucy   and you know what else   you have to get that data in the first place   records  documents  files   probably restricted files at that   jean    dear  you've picked up four copies of the same book   it's not going to make it four times better  you know   susan havers   isn't this a coincidence   or maybe not   hello  jean   about time too  i've been waiting half a day   what   some ladies for you   if it's the wi  you can tell them to piss off  and stick their nose into someone else's cake sale   oh  my goodness   it's been years     how are you  lucy    i'm well   i'm really well   i can't believe this   i'd invite you in  but     oh  no  no  no  no  don't worry   we need your help  actually   my help  with what   phil and lit club  is it   you all read the same book and chat about it   more or less   we used to do it in the war   so when susan and i bumped into one another  we thought    why not    i'll bet the moment i'm out the door   charles dickens doesn't get a look in  and you'll spend the morning gossiping about old times   he may be on to us  susan     off with you now  dear    yes  yes   it's good to see you smiling   you should have done something like this earlier     you're right    bye   i remember a christmas carol on the wireless   but i don't think i've read this one   i don't think we're actually here to read the book  lucy   are we   mummy  we're home   perhaps he'll leave a clue or make a mistake  but how many more girls will die before the police catch him   we can do better   he's making a pattern   he doesn't even realise he's doing it   if we can crack it   we'll be able to see what his next move will be   just like knowing where the german army will be in three days' time   if we get ahead of him   we can stop him before he kills again      how  exactly    well  just like we used to   treat the killings like a code   keep at it till we break it   if susan's right  perhaps we are  the only people to find his pattern   i know you feel strongly about this girls  but     it's really not our place   and what if we do find it  we take it to the police   no  i tried that  then what's the point   well  perhaps we can do more     what do you mean    perhaps we could     find him   what   isn't that dangerous   i'm sorry  susan  but i'll say it again   this is not our place   well  perhaps this isn't our place either  jean   sitting around in our cosy front rooms  while the police do nothing   we could be useful again   what do you mean   useful again    are you saying we're not useful now   oh  come on  jean  we used to make a difference  every day   we saved lives  we fought   i mean  not like the men  obviously     but we did our bit    that was the war   this is different     we're still the same  aren't we    so says the housewife  with two children and a husband up for a promotion   don't be so silly   if we're so silly  why do you need us   well     it's been lovely seeing you all     please  jean      i'm sorry   but i really do have to be going   no  you don't understand   it looks random  but it isn't   he's working to a timetable   any day now  he'll take some other poor girl   best leave it to the police   lucy     some girl is going to die because you won't bloody listen   aren't you staying  look   i'll come and see you next week  i promise   this is lovely  better than a restaurant   well  you deserve it  darling  congratulations   to the new head of       what was it again    the new supervisor  of vehicle licensing and his lovely wife   well done   i forgot to ask about your club   did you actually manage any phil and lit   oh  no  you were right  it was mostly just gossip   i knew as much   darling   do you like your job   well  it's a good job   i suppose it's not all that exciting  but   it's important   and i think perhaps i've had my fair share  of excitement for one lifetime     morning    good morning  sarah   no  that's it for today  actually  thanks     have a nice day    see you soon     anything else  madam    no   you were right  we didn't listen  and now another girl's gone missing   god willing that she's still alive    and can be found in time    yes  but i was wrong   i'm an amateur   i saw a connection that wasn't there and  convinced myself it meant something   that's because you've been working from newspaper and wireless reports   but they're only repeating what the police tell them  and they won't tell them everything   why wouldn't they tell them everything   because some of it will be too dull   but the dull details are often the vital ones   and some of it's going to be too awful   indeed  we need to find out  exactly what happened to those girls   thank you for this   royal general mortuary  let's go before dorothy changes her mind   so    there we have it   all the information   what does  post mortem penetration  mean   it means they weren't raped and then murdered   they were murdered and then raped   all of them   we don't have jane hart's file   because they did the autopsy at st anne's  but these three  yes   why were all the others taken to the royal general   i suppose by then  they knew they were connected   but jane hart was the first   well  we really need to see that file too  jean   getting across town at rush hour will take a while     use the goblin    sorry  dear   gospel oak and barking line   you'll have to hurry  the trains only go at twenty past   wait  hold on a minute   they were all making journeys   they were all going somewhere  or coming back     yes  what does that mean    i said it myself   he's working to a timetable  he's working to a pattern   so were they   the railways   that's how he's finding them   what's this   i'm going to go see my mum   what's wrong with her this time   there's casserole in the oven   that's something  i suppose   i can do a double shift at the weekend to make up   but i just can't do today   it's just one shift  please   well  i'm sure we can work something out   i mean  i do something for you and     you can do something for me   never mind   you think you can find another job that easy  do ya   there's an awful lot of girls out there  darling   and not enough jobs to go round   perhaps   darling   but none will be desperate enough  for a job to want to screw you   they all made train journeys  not the same journey    not even the same line  that's what confused me   i thought they must all be passing through his area   but that's not it   he is on a train too   a train compartment  it's perfect   it's private   a man can talk to a woman and it's not unseemly   all right  he talks to them  but how does he get them off the train  and back to wherever it is he takes them   he can't just cart them off  screaming through the rush hour   they'd have to trust him and go willingly   but why on earth would they do that   have you got it all  lucy  everything memorised   all right  how many points of connection are there  between the routes the different girls took    gosh  he's not taking 46 trains  he's taking one   millie  lipstick   lucy  can you mark them up  each journey  please   now  we're not looking at the lines   we're looking at where they cross  what they intersect with   because that's where he is  he's in the gaps   susan  it doesn't work  it can't   you've got three sets of overland train routes here   and all right  they connect to each other   but emily dixon didn't take an overland train   she took the tube from clapham common to turnpike lane   what was her route   clapham common  northern line to st pancras   change to piccadilly line  through to turnpike lane   no connection at all   it has to connect  we're missing something   lucy  she disappeared on the first   anything   first of may  northern line  no faults or delays reported   first of may  piccadilly line     lucy   they closed it   here   there was a points failure the day emily disappeared   they closed the line for two hours   so she arrives at st pancras  goes to take the piccadilly line  but can't because it's shut  so what does she do   she comes up to the surface  at st pancras station     and he's right there    waiting for her   no   waiting for his train   she would have been there at     six o'clock   we've got 46 points of connection between the girls' routes   but how many are left if they all have to connect  to st pancras station around six o'clock on the first of may     none of these    not this one   not that one either   there it is   that's it  there's only one   the 6 15 slow train from st pancras to barking   it's five o'clock  claire and sam can have tea next door   timothy's not due home till seven   why don't we go and see for ourselves   the train on platform five is about to depart   why do men do it     what    kill women   women kill too  you know   not like this  only men do this   he takes the 6 15 slow train   lots of people getting on and off  as they travel different routes on other lines   lots of chances to meet someone   follow them if he wants to  maybe change trains if he needs to   so he meets her  he talks to her   why does she trust him   he's someone important  respectable   a businessman  he's wearing a suit   would you go off with a businessman you'd just met   no   maybe he threatens her  maybe he has a knife   look at all these people   someone would see   one of the girls would have shouted out   nobody saw anything   he's invisible   here we are   sorry it's such a tip   it's lovely  don't worry   right   first things first  we need to find mary lawrence   all right   if the killer is a railway guard or a ticket inspector   then his schedule connected to her journey somewhere   not just mary lawrence  all the girls   every time he takes a victim  he makes the pattern clearer   we need the points of connection for all the shifts   all the routes and keep the 6 15 slow train  as a constant     do you need to get to work    not tonight   well  i've got one  millie   just one  upton park   upton park   so where is she now   bomb sites  ruins  rubble   we need to go and look for her   how much longer are we going to keep doing this   look for doors  cellars  anything underground   dear  we are   there's nothing here and i've laddered my stockings     jean    jean   what was this place   oh  dear christ     mary lawrence   god have mercy   lucy  are you seeing this   i don't want to   please   we have to remember all this   you got it   please can we leave   lucy  are you all right   she's dead  we were too    we were too late   oh  sweetheart  we were always going to be too late   then what was the point   why did we have to come here and see her like that  if we couldn't even help her  what was the point of it     lucy      she's just like us   she's just like us and he killed her     lucy  i'm so sorry   i didn't think it would be so    what did you think it would be like  susan   did you see the cigarette butts on the floor in there     what does it matter    it matters  because it means he took his time in there   it matters because it's so casual   he's not worried  he's not afraid   he knows bloody well he'll get away with it   so when he's finished  he stops for a smoke   for god's sake   so what do we do now   call the police  leave it at that   forget it  go home  pretend it never happened   i can't do that   not anymore   no  neither can i   you were right   they're never going to find him   no   we are   angela  when i was at special operations executive     there were rumours    what kind of rumours   maybe he makes it look like others did it   placing false evidence at the crime scenes   pointing to someone else   you need to understand the psychology of your target   what drives him  what makes him tick   try and get inside his head   they go with him because he has something they want   what if we give him what he's looking for   we made an arrest this afternoon     what    i must say  it's thanks to you     she's not here    well  what do i do   call the police now   lucy   itfc subtitle sync  marocas62
