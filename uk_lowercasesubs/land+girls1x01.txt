on the very beginning of the war   one of germany's principle aims  has been britain's starvation   yet today  britain can claim to be the best fed country in europe   and girls as we know are playing their part on the land   just as faithfully as in the workshops   and although a picture of farming may look like a holiday   believe me  it's one of the toughest war jobs there is   the women's land army  and farmers all over britain   have fought and are still fighting their hardest to win the battle of supplies   when the last battle has been won  that's a fact we mustn't forget    just smell that fresh air   isn't it awful     thank you  general    it's private   i won't tell anyone   well  where's he going   you didn't expect him to carry them all the way to the farm  did you   stay and get the later train  we could have two more hours together   two more hours of you bending my ear   you can't wait to get away  can you   you'd never have spoken to me like this before you joined up   shame you didn't stand up to your father the same way   i'm grateful that you helped us   but   but    we need to talk about this  harry   i've said all i'm going to say  annie   i mean it   isn't

helmstead is only two miles away  so we could just walk   you expect me to lug all this  in these heels   for goodness' sake   where you going       aren't you supposed to be meeting some girls    this is more important   you've got to be strong  annie   you know where i'm going  what i'm heading into   yet you waste money dragging me up here to tell me there's no baby   i'm sorry if i've failed you   promise me you'll write     i don't know where i'll be    please   take care of yourself   it's a beautiful day   we'll sleep well tonight   well  it would help if there were some signs

dance  of course  everyone is welcome   there's more important things for them to worry about     i'm sorry  i just assumed you were      what  the gardener   head gamekeeper at least   so about this dance  sir   yes  well  yes  it's in a few days   a chance for everyone to let their hair down     sounds smashing    certainly does   this has got to be a joke   i've seen worse     mum    you tell

quick thinking   only when she comes back  don't mention it  she's a bit embarrassed   have i missed anything   no  um     i was just asking if there was anything else to eat   and there's not   i can't believe this place   last week i was in a nice  warm recruiting office  five minutes away from home   daddy could get us steak sometimes  he's a civil servant   oh  we haven't had steak since     so why did you join the women's land army   she was conscripted   i can talk for myself   i wouldn't be here if i could help it    no offence   mum's birthday  remember     and what does your husband do    he's in the raf   wow  well  he's training at the moment but he will be a navigator   and where are you from   from coventry   the bombings have flattened most of it   my whole street's gone   whole houses  you know  just     and the salon where i worked  that's     what about your family   so  what happens for entertainment in this dump   well  seeing as though we've got a five o'clock start tomorrow   i reckon we should get an early night     there must be something to do    oh  yeah  yeah there is   i'll wash and  er  you can wipe     you should see me out in france    wearing my tin hat       i know it's soppy   but i'll say it again   i miss you   without you  i feel completely alone   despite being with a great bunch of mates   the days are long and the training's tough   you have to be alert at all times   it's been hard work   but i've learnt lots of new skills  so i can be top notch in my job   in some ways  i wish training didn't have to finish   but then  all things must end   with love always  john     down on the maginot line     hey  can i get one of those   they're rationed  sorry     how about if i just borrow it    how does that work   that's amazing

no  no  no  let me  it's the least i can do   and no  before you ask  i can't make her disappear   it's not your fault   she's just down in the dumps cos her husband's gone to fight   thank you   you're welcome   what   maybe this wasn't such a good idea   can't you read   martin   martin     what am i supposed to be looking at    the sign   so  it's segregation   black troops can only go to certain places at certain times     but it's wrong    i don't make the rules  take it up with the yanks   i can't believe the americans do that to their own troops   you're head of the home guard  you could stand up to them  mr  tucker  they'd listen to you   yes  i know i could   but i've got far more important things to do than picking fights with our allies   and so have you   bea   i'm sorry  i didn't mean to snap at you earlier   i just don't want you making a show of yourself  that's all   you're the one making a show of me   i just don't want you to jeopardise anything here   as if i'd do anything that'd get us sent back home   well  just remember what it was like there   look  i'm not stupid   i wish everyone would stop telling me what to do   come on   why are you all watching   we just want to make sure you're ok  sweetheart   quite a bash   my arm's fractured  like a casualty of war  mum   i'm proud of you  lad   you know how soldiers get medals when they're brave   can i have one   i've got something better than that   can i just     brave soldiers only   well  all i know is that lord hoxley said everyone was welcome   anyway   i've worked out how to stop all the segregation  hm   i've started a petition     and as you've got a pen in your hand      oh  yep  go on then   all yours  joyce   aren't i next   no we've changed the rota  no one wanted to go after you   not our fault you fell in a cow pat   twice   i think some went up my nose   you can keep your bath  i've got a better idea   where's she going   scuse me  sir     would you like to sign my petition    no  no   hello  sir  would you sign my petition   shouldn't you be at the farm     fancied some air  mrs  gulliver    what  hanging around the pub   as if you land girls haven't got enough of a reputation   farmer finch  would you like to sign my petition   now  would you take umbrage if i said no   you don't even know what it's about   it might be for free whisky     is it    no   i'll sign it   what are you doing   remember what happened to your uncle eddie   he signed a form  and before he knew it   his cart horse belonged to the local butcher   free whisky   that would have been nice   it's not about free whisky   come on  billy   i'm sorry  bea   good night   can i fix you one   i need a clear head   now  i'm using a different band this time   the last lot practically murdered moonlight serenade   i don't know why you agonise over it   you've got soldiers  land girls and alcohol all in the same room   none of them are going to care what the music's like   i'm not organising an orgy   does it hurt   nothing i can't cope with   brave soldier   i'm thinking of having drinks with the mayor before things really get going   am i invited to that part   don't be ridiculous  of course you are   honestly  sometimes you are so taxing   will you be well enough to dance   well  it rather depends who with   i think i might go up to my room   i wasn't aware we'd finished   will you run me a bath first   i'm sorry   well  we meet again   lawrence   lawrence     darling    there's no need to put in any oil   in fact  i can finish  good night  lawrence   right   what are you doing   i just  i don't think there's any clean towels in there   nonsense  the maid put some out fresh this morning   what has got into you   i was wondering    if    maybe  we should tell the maid not to warm both beds tonight   is it our anniversary or something   perhaps you could fix us some drinks   right   sorry  didn't mean to startle you     smoke    i don't know you   i'm wearing this uniform  that makes us friends   you know which end to put in your mouth   i know what i'm doing   you didn't ask me to sign your petition   you won't want to   i'd love to  but i can't  there's a difference   is that because you can't write   hey  i can do joined up and everything   no  we're not allowed to get involved in political activities   you done good   some of the names don't count   i've had a mickey mouse   a clark gable and a charlie chaplin  and i'm sure none of them live in helmstead   you want a present   it's not another cigarette  is it   thanks   so  you going to the dance tomorrow night   my sister probably won't let me   you always do everything your sister says   where've you been   it's before curfew     want some gum    an australian gave it to you   don't worry  i didn't have to do anything untoward   you don't know the effect you have     who was he    just a rather nice gi   you don't even know his name   well  he was wearing a us army uniform  that makes us friends   well  you don't need that sort of friend     why are you always trying to control me    because i have to look after you   do you   or is it easier than having a life of your own   right well  if that's the way you feel   then i'll let you make your own mistakes   well  maybe you should   at least i won't settle down and marry the first man  who shows the slightest bit of interest in me   a man i don't even love  and then spend the rest of my life regretting it   right  that's it  you can forget about going to the dance   you can't stop me   deliveries are in the kitchen   no  sorry  i've got something else   it's a petition   against what   i think it's wrong that black and white troops can't go the same places   do you   yes  i want the signs taken down   the ones saying whites only   there must be  what  24 names here   look  i'm sure there's a lot more people who feel the same way   thank you for this   i'm sure the state department back in washington  are going to realise the error of their ways now   you can't just sweep it under the carpet   i'm waiting here till you take it seriously   and i can wait a long time  you know   ok  i'll make sure this gets seen by the relevant people   really   we'll give the matter our full consideration   what are you doing tonight   you're very forward for an english girl   i'm not asking you out  silly   not like that  anyway  it's the dance at the manor house   i've already got a date  but you can come if you like     we're not invited    that's where you're wrong   i've just delivered a petition saying that we won't have segregation in helmstead   impressive  but that don't mean we can come tonight   wrong again  lord hoxley said everyone was invited   even farmer finch   really   trust me   sure   well  she's always been reckless   she gets an idea in her head and then that's it  no stopping her   she can't do any harm with you looking after her   no  but she's only a child   young in her ways  yeah   oh  no  she's  she's only 17   she lied about her age so she could join up   i should have done that   said i was 41 so they wouldn't let me in   it's all right  your secret's safe with me     oh  smoked salmon    sliced beetroot   right  i've got to work for lady hoxley tonight  so i need someone to look after martin for me   annie   i need to go to the dance

one   come on  you're done   now  put it above your top lip   gives it a fuller look   oh  yeah  you're right   oh  that's a bit too much   no one asked you   don't worry  i'll watch her   now  show me what to do with my eyes   it feels odd coming to a dance without my john   well  don't worry  no one's going to proposition you   i should hope not   why not   ladies   allow me to buy you a beverage     isn't it free    oh  well observed   i swear we'd have winged it if we'd had more armoury   but it is hard to shoot a plane from the ground   of course  we didn't have to deal with that in the great war  did we  sir   this is more like it   beats being face down in a ditch   that must have been so frightening  when the plane attacked   where's finch with those drinks   you shouldn't be embarrassed about nancy saving you     saving me    aren't the band good   no  i enjoy working for the spitfire fund   oh  and that's not your only charity  your ladyship   putting up with those common girls   it'd drive a saint to drink   i must mingle  have you seen the mayor   bea   you look    you look       nice    nice   he forgets the simplest of things if i'm not there to guide 'im

prizes for guessing who gave you that idea   he's my guest   you said you'd fix things   grow up   take them away   you said it'd be fine     wait    so you can humiliate me again   now  next time  just stay out of things that don't concern you   let's get you a drink   don't you wish you were dancing   not really   is your husband good dancer   yes   i rather let him down  two left feet   can you fix it   i don't   know     better    no   it's nice coming to these things when you're happily married   cos i can just relax and not be worried about men   where's the fun in that   shouldn't we keep an eye on bea   you can watch her  i'll watch the handsome men in uniform  thank you very much   it's a difficult situation  bea   but then  hey  i don't make the laws   drink up   would you  er
