in and say hello   no  no  no  me old mate  nobody calls in just to say hello anymore   only last week del boy dropped into the showroom just to say hello   by the time he left  he'd sold me 33 bottles of latvian chablis   no  i was just passing by and i saw you standing in your driveway   i thought i'd stop off and say  ''how are you ''  oh  forgive me  you must be the exception to the rule   so  how are you   well  to be perfectly honest  i'm feeling a bit down   oh  never mind   it's just this modern society  you know   you know  every morning i wake up and i feel i'm gonna be attacked   well  why don't you leave the house before marlene gets up   no  you see  in the old days if you worked hard and you were successful   everybody just applauded your endeavour and invited you to become a mason   these days  everybody just seems to want a piece of what you've got   only you're lucky  you see  you've got nothing   yeah  well  fingers crossed it continues  eh   but today  denzil  you have rekindled my belief in human nature   you called round just to say hello   and it was just a genuine concern for an old friend   and that sort of humanity deserves reward   i'm taking you to the pizza hut   and i'm paying   cheers  boycie   well  actually  there was something i wanted to ask you    oh  here we go   no  no  no  it's not for me   no  it's just that i happened to notice your

with them   nah  there's no danger of that   the driscolls are being released in three weeks' time   being released   in god's name  how   accused of two counts of murder  gbh   drug smuggling  importing illegal immigrants and refusing to pay their council tax   they received four life sentences each   yeah  i know   but they've got an appeal being heard and the word is they're gonna walk

tell you   just lately i've been getting a bit fed up with my life    have you got a bird   no   i told you before  you are my wife and my bit on the side   oh  boycie   sometimes you can be really romantic   yeah  look  look  have a look at this   can you imagine yourself living there   no  i couldn't   look at it  it's in the middle of the country  miles from anywhere   nobody would ever be able to find you  would they   no  i couldn't see me in a house like that   well  give it a try  dear  'cause i've bought it    you've bought it   yeah  that's gonna be our new home    what happens to this house   we sell it    we can't sell our house   yes  we can   look   you've sold our     no  you can't do that  it's in both our names  i haven't signed   yeah  you have    that's not my signature   no  but it's close  innit    you forged my signature   well  what could i do  you were away   i am not moving from this house   is that how much it's worth   house prices have gone crazy round here   and it's about time we moved  marlene  we're getting stagnant here   where is this place   shropshire   what's shropshire   not what  where   all right  where's shropshire   it's  er     it's up there somewhere   near wales   oh  i get it   you'll buy yourself a flat and then while you're down here in london  running your business and having a great time with your mates   i'm stuck up there in the arse end of nowhere  living in the little house on the prairie   no  i've sold the business as well   well  it's a mid life thing   remember how you were  you broke a teapot   get me a drink    i thought you said you were never going to     get me a drink     you see  marlene   we're at that stage of our lives where we need a change   you either tell me the truth or i'm gonna strip naked   okay   the driscoll brothers are going to be released from prison in a fortnight's time   how  they got 42 years apiece   it's a combination of bribery and human rights   latvian   okay  so the driscoll brothers are being released  what's that matter to you   well  the thing is  they don't like me   nobody likes you  but you never moved to shropshire before   no  you see  there's    there's a rumour going around  that during the investigation into their activities  the police had a supergrass   and the driscoll brothers have got it into their silly old heads that it was me   oh  my god  you were the supergrass   no  i wasn't   look  the investigating officer happens to be a member of my masonic lodge   of course i talked to him  what else was i supposed to do    all right  then  when the driscoll brothers are released    just go round there  talk it all out   talk it all out   marlene  this is the south london mafia  not richard   judy   the driscoll brothers won't listen to me   they won't be able to listen to me 'cause they'll be wearing my kneecaps as earmuffs   look  you're not certain of anything  it might just be your imagination   i was out jogging the other day and three men drove past and sort of looked at me kind of funny   well  i've told you  it's them shorts  they make you look gay   now  look  it's obvious  isn't it   it's the driscoll brothers' heavies checking up on my whereabouts  they're after me   well  i'm staying put  i've done nothing wrong   what  you think they'll let you off   they'll hurt you to get at me  they think i like you   and then there's tyler   they wouldn't do anything to a young kid like tyler   remember that kid from deptford  he's only just come out of a coma   yeah  but he asked for trouble   he went round banging on their front door one night   he was a carol singer   there must be something we can do   couldn't we go on a police protection scheme   police protect    it was the police who told them   now  look  marlene  we have got to get out of peckham   no one must know we've gone and no one must know where we've gone to   so what you're saying is we've got to get a new life   well  you have  i'm just trying to hang on to this one    can i invite my mother up for the weekend   no   you don't think she'd grass on her own daughter  do you   no  i just don't like her   oh  yeah   but what about tyler  he's got to move schools and he's right in the middle of his gcse studies   yeah  i know   but with his ability and intelligence   he can fail those exams at any school in the country   yeah  love him   i so do not want to live in the country  i hate the country   as i've explained to you  darling  it's either that or daddy gets killed    mum  all my friends are in peckham   yes  i understand  tyler  but     now  what's that saying i'm looking for   oh  yeah  shut up   now  we must remember that we are moving to a small village   a close knit community who most probably view all newcomers with a bit of suspicion   so it is important that we don't do anything to draw attention to ourselves     tyler   marlene  you should've turned right back there   boycie  for god's sake  marlene  we've got satellite navigation  trust me   marlene  where did you get that satellite navigation from   boycie  who do you think   marlene  thank you  and once again  i'm sorry we weren't there to help you     marlene  that was the removal men   they've put all our furniture in the house and now they're halfway back to london   and where are we  no bloody where   if we invite my mother up for the weekend  she'll never find it   well  that's lucky  'cause we ain't inviting her     oh   you dirty dog  that is revolting   come on  i'll go and ask directions in the pub   it's not going to be all morris dancers and sheepdogs  is it   don't be stupid  this is the 21 st century  woman     can i help you good people   yes  we're looking for the grange  winterdown farm

 it is a pleasure to meet you   why don't you stay and have a drink  get to know your new neighbours   oh   now  we has a custom in these here parts   whenever newcomers arrive in our village  everyone in the pub buys them a drink    oh   that's very civil  i'll have a large cognac   a tequila shot  please    vodka and red bull   coke   all right  vodka and coke  then   shut up   no  wait a minute  no  no  that's it   you buy everyone in the pub a drink   right  what'll it be   it's very dark  innit   yes  it's what they call in the country ''night''   so  we got electricity  then   yes

got a lion  and some sort of spotty tiger   for god's sake  marlene  we ain't got to feed them   i know things aren't quite to your liking at the moment   but in time you will put your personality upon it   then it'll be really good  won't it   the main thing is that we are secure   nobody knows that we are here  so no one will come looking for us   yeah  yeah  you're right  we're safe   safe as houses     who is it  dad   well  from here it's difficult to tell  son      what about earl   no  that's not earl   no  i mean he might get hurt     you'll have to answer it  boycie   have you gone mad   look  think about it   we've only been here five minutes   the people at home don't even know we've left yet    so it's got to be someone local   yes  yes  yes    all right  yes  i just panicked a bit  that's all   go on  go on  go and open it   don't worry  you'll be all right   tyler  hide somewhere   oh  there you are  good evening   are you mr boyce   i might be  who wants to

walls   oh  no  don't misunderstand me   you see  the old squire's wife died very suddenly   a bit too suddenly for her own good  if you ask me   and the old squire was    how should i put it  a bit     a bit strange   oh  'cause he'd lost the love of his life   oh  no  he was nuttier than a squirrel's fart long before she died   he'd sit here in this room  with his 1 2 bore shotgun  in the dark   wearing nothing but a pair of night vision goggles kindly donated by the women's institute   and he'd wait for 'em to come out    wait for who to come out   the rats   then he'd blast 'em   it was very messy  but they've done a lovely repair job    we've got rats   oh  no  ma'am  they're long gone   oh  thank god for that   snakes frightened them away   country humour   yeah  the old squire shot all these animals   we had a hell of a job repairing the walls    if i may be so bold  sir   hmm   which bedroom will you and your good lady be     sleeping in   well  the master bedroom   oh
