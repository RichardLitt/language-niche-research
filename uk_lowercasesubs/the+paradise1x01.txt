 why  denise   now my day's all sunshine   come in   let me take your coat   aye  it's not   just a visit   i'm sorry  uncle  i know i should have written to say i was coming   but i'd made up my mind that it was time so     well  that's     denise  i     i know i always said you would come here one day  and you will   you will  i swear it   things will pick up  and once they do  you and i will     surely business can't be so bad   perhaps in a few months' time   moray  saturday's figures    153   we did it    we  did it  ok   oh  lord  don't you dare   what  that look you're wearing   what look is that  restlessness   upheaval  trouble  admit it    you have something on your mind   was madam looking for any particular department   no  thank you  i was hoping     i'm looking for work   oh  try ladieswear department  first floor   the girl from there has   left   ask for miss audrey  thank you   when miss audrey looks down her nose at you  remember this    she shaves her top lip   i'm sam  by the way   you're supposed to tell me your name  now  oh  i'm denise   well  denise  you're a country girl  aren't you  is it so obvious   here   a touch of blue ribbon   might distract them from your boots   draw their attention to your eyes   thank you   can you help me  please  i need to speak to miss audrey   cleaners should report to the back door   i was hoping for a position working here   a position  in ladieswear    then i must introduce you to our head of department at once   miss audrey  this young lady seems to think you might like to take her on   my name's denise  ma'am  i believe you may have an opening for a sales girl  i may have   do you have experience   i worked in my local draper's store  ma'am  in peebles   i shall have to take your word for it that peebles has a draper's shop   good morning  miss audrey  morning  girls  please  carry on   do you have a testimonial   yes  ma'am   mr lovett   are you his niece   yes  ma'am  is that edmund lovett   yes  sir  did he send you here  no  sir   well  the fact that lovett can't find work for his niece  in his own establishment  i will gladly oblige a neighbour   that is if miss audrey should choose to take you on   the application will proceed in the usual manner  miss lovett   we will write to you   thank you   darling  my father has agreed to speak with you  i mean about the loan for your store   thank you  katherine   it is most kind of you to offer this   papa tried to tell me that you must go back to the bank   but i glared at him  and he is decidedly more amenable   he will try to be grumpy  but you will charm him in five minutes   well  i hope that once he hears my plans   he will see that it is good business   i will help you   is he inside   he will be shortly   darling  i have invited some friends for tea   they have been pestering me to meet you   i can't keep you secret any longer   will you join us   i always told your ma      denise will be the one who takes on my business    that's still true today   there was a time that place was no bigger than my own   emmerson's  it was called then   james emmerson   how did mr moray get the store   he married emmerson's daughter  soon after old james passed away   mr moray is married  he was   some people say he got lucky   i don't say that   in the last two years  that place has eaten half the street   his wife died   someone has to stop him   uncle   i've been offered a position at the paradise   you can't  denise  i must work  uncle   i must earn a wage or how will i survive here   and a perfume i had especially imported from morocco   it is so intoxicating   one wisp of it       and i find myself utterly hypnotised   beyond all sense   i dare not let myself imagine what they put into it   oh  really  you must come to the paradise  ladies   to try the fragrance  perhaps   i have heard that it is entirely possible that one may find oneself  at the same glove counter as a grocer's wife   imagine buying the very scent a butcher's daughter is wearing   i'm sure the grocer's wife would be greatly relieved  that she does not have to stand beside your celebrated radiance  ladies   it is  however  my loss  and i must satisfy myself by giving my attention to the butcher's daughter   but i will wait in my store  ladies   in the hope that one day soon you will come to me   'if there is a more attractive man within a hundred miles '  i will kiss my husband   he is utterly adorable  katherine   he is talking to your father rather intensely   my question for you  moray  is this   does the world truly need more perfumes and petticoats   need is not the issue  sir   i deal in appetite   there's a weakness in women which we must exploit to the advantage of business   i know you've been turned away by every bank in town  moray   women are fickle   can you guarantee they'll go on spending their money  on your perfumes and fripperies   i see that i must show you conclusively  what the paradise can do   has he proposed to you  what a question to ask   that is no kind of a denial   which means that he has   katherine  how wonderful   please  you must say nothing   we have hardly spoken about it   but we must celebrate   it will be the event of the year   why moray   of all the men you could have chosen  katherine  why him   he'll conquer the city  i'm not sure he'll make much of a husband   you said no  and made him wait   he's convinced he can prove to me that his store is irresistible   perhaps it is  but you must let him feel you're unsure   he brings out something in you that disturbs me   it is only the chase  papa   you're denise  aren't you  i'm arthur  follow me   keep up   i know every face in this place   and every name  and all   don't look so worried  everyone here had their first day   except me  howay   see that there  that's where i was born   there you are  anything you need to know  ask arthur   girl  dallying is considered a sin in a department store   i hope you're not going to be a dallier  are you a dallier  no  miss audrey  i was just     no time for chattering  girl  here is your uniform   you may change in ladieswear today  from tomorrow  you must arrive ready for work   just in time  pauline  why must you always be just in time  sorry  ma'am   it was my hair got caught in my dress  sorry   you'll be shown to your room after work   we expect our girls to be in bed by ten o'clock  yes  miss audrey   you can share with me  room  we live three to a bed   i mean room  do you snore   i snore  come on   that's how we wear it  other girls snigger  we take turns with the customers  i'll show you   we put our name on the board  that way it's fair  we all get our turn   to earn commission  no one could survive on the wages   i can't  anyway   there  now you're one of us   pauline  why are you never where you're supposed to be   it is a sin to abandon your department  quickly  girl  haberdashery  sorry  miss audrey   sorry   oh  denise   you must learn how to wear clothes   if you must keep your hair long  then tie it up properly   it looks like a mongrel dog's tail hanging there   we require standards of dress and decorum from our girls   there will be no relations with the male staff  no relations   any manner of relations on shop premises will be dealt with swiftly and severely   your predecessor was discovered with a young man in a       alone in her room   girl  miss audrey  ah   they were slow cashing up last night  go over and see what's going on   the linen deliveries  the driver  he's too friendly  we should keep an eye on him   he's a cousin of young chapel's  he's a friendly fellow  that's all   it's the friendly fellows that steal your elbows when you turn your back on them   moray seems intent on more expansion   has he said anything to you   huh  did he set you to work on any behind the scenes business   sir  if i may   mr moray expects absolute discretion   jonas  i need to know what moray's up to  and prevent him from excess   i should look in on the cashier  sir   make sure there is no hesitation   get your shoes on  denise  we're all going out   i can't  pauline  i've got no money   tell her  pauline  we usually get some young man to buy us a drink   what happened to mr moray's wife   don't ever mention his wife in the paradise  do you understand   it's forbidden   no one ever talks about her   what happened  there was an accident   she died   people talk  oh  it's all gossip and rumour   people say all sorts of horrible things  about mr moray  they're jealous  that's all   they like to think bad of him because he's made something of himself   what fun is there staying here on your own  denise   we work so hard so we like to dance and flirt and live  come on   another night i will   if you don't join in  be one of the girls   you won't last long here   it's a good life if you go with it   what are you doing  mr moray  sir   i'm thinking  arthur   what are you thinking about  mr moray  sir   proof   i must prove that the paradise can conquer this whole city   is it hard thinking about proof  sir  it looks mighty painful   do you want me to do some thinking for you  i'm mighty good at thinking  me   i'll manage  thank you  arthur   something will come to me   edmund   i'm pleased to say your niece seems to be doing well at the paradise   she should be working here  with me  her family   and she will be  soon enough  the days of the small shop are dying  edmund   she sees that   that place of yours is no more than a phantom  moray  a daydream folks will soon wake up from   if you want to fight me  edmund   you will lose   because it is not a man you're taking on   it is progress   what are they to you  moray   cattle to herd through your door   sell cheap  is that all that matters to you   think that's what they really want  tempt them with cheaper and cheaper   i'll tell you what will win in the end   one person serving another   thank you  edmund   moray  this is ten times our weekly orders   i want to fill the store to bursting   every department  every counter  every inch   why would you want to do that   we will announce that the price of everything is to be greatly reduced   ah  i see  splendid notion  if i'm allowed to sound just a slight note of caution   why so much   why don't we order what we can afford and put on a reduced price sale in one department  perhaps two   ah  yes  yes  yes  of course  i see it now    the paradise announces a small sale    we could do that if we wanted a small outcome  a small reward   really  dudley   do you want to live in a small world   forgive my naivety  moray   you are right because  well  you are always right   i'll get these orders sent off directly   arthur  mr dudley  sir   before i send these off   one tiny  possibly irritating  difficulty occurs to me   how do we pay our suppliers for these mountains of goods  we don't   we take delivery and we stall until after the sale   why  tell him why  arthur   proof  sir   to prove to glendenning that the paradise can woo every woman in this city through our door   it's a gamble  it's a necessary gamble   slow down  that is all i'm asking   there's no need for such haste   men who slow down  dudley  men who take their time   they come second   i do not do that   miss   sir  thank you  mr jonas  sir   you were asking questions about mr moray's wife   no  i     yes  i was  but i didn't mean to pry or gossip   who told you i was asking   you're new  you were bound to ask   the poor woman fell   the foundations for the first extension were dug   and she fell  a terrible  sorry misfortune   now you know   yes  now i know   so there's no need to ask any more questions   no  sir  i mean  yes  sir   the day will come  denise   when mr moray will call you to his office   be ready   she's so beautiful   that is katherine glendenning  one of the richest women in the city   everyone says they are to marry  her and moray  married   you've fallen for him  haven't you   no   course i haven't  that would be silly   it would be foolish  what a ridiculous thing   every shop girl does   mr jonas said i'd be called into mr moray's office one day   what did he mean  well  you are on probation here   when you are called  moray will tell you if you are to stay   or not  not stay   oh  some girls  some of the girls   the ones who feel they're losing their jobs   they're called to his office   it's only tales  i expect   'it's a triumph  moray  katherine glendenning in the paradise '  everyone knows you'll marry her   huh  is that the gossip   any man would marry katherine glendenning   hasn't enough time passed now   you deserve to marry again   ladies  good afternoon   let me help you to decide which fabrics to choose   perhaps we're not as easily tempted as you might imagine  moray   mrs ballentine  isn't the whole point of temptation to succumb   if my husband thought i had bought one more gown  his face would be even more sour than it already is   then we won't tell him  it will be our secret  mrs harkness   my husband probably wouldn't even notice  if i was your husband   i would never deny you anything you wanted   how can such beautiful women ever have enough beautiful things   ever have enough of anything   you  mrs ballentine  if i may   you must wear silk   only silk   only ever silk   excuse me  clara  but it's my turn   it will be your turn  when you can sell   but if i don't earn my commission   i need the money   why do you need the money  you have rooms  you have food   you going to cry  country girl   why are you doing this  it's only my name you cross off  do you think i don't see that  why   girls  what is going on here   my name was top of the board  ma'am  but clara wiped it away   i am the one who decides whose turn it is   our regular customers are too valuable to give to you until you know what you are doing   but ma'am  if i'm to learn    you are on probation   do not defy me  defying is the worst of sins in a department store   there is plenty of folding and stacking to do  quickly   quickly   yes  ma'am   i was curious  your store is rather beautiful  in a brash kind of way   you don't mind me teasing you  do you  darling   i thought i might buy some trinket   just to show you i'm not entirely immune to your seduction   might i suggest you visit the ladieswear department  oh   i'm not sure i could face the world in any dress that was not made by my own seamstress   katherine   do you suppose a man cares  if a woman's dress is hand sewn   mm   a stitch does not make the blood rise   i'm sorry that my father was such an old stick about your plans  moray   we must work on him together  you and i   he will see how fond i am of you  and his resistance will melt   i am already making my own plans to overcome his resistance   tell me   when i'm ready   in five days' time   the paradise  the whole store  every department   will come together in one grand sale   prices will be so reduced for one day   that customers flock to our store   i want this to be our best day ever   i want us to create such a frenzy of shopping  that we make in one day more than we do in a week   i don't suppose any one of you will object if your pockets are bursting with bonuses   there is a lot of work for us to do  but i do not see before me one face shy of that   well said  mr moray  sir   i know what i shall do with my bonus   i'd like to come into the store and buy the fanciest coat  or perhaps some boots   pauline dreams of being a customer here  one day   she thinks if she's on the other side of the counter  a well to do man will fall for her   no  i don't  but you do see some fine gentlemen  and they can't all be married   what will you do with your bonus  clara   i won't worry about that until it's in my hand   there he is  with his writing   what's he doing  every day he writes in that book   what he sees and what he knows  no doubt   i'd love to get my hands on that book   what about you  denise  what will you buy with your bonus   i don't know that i'll buy anything  perhaps something for your uncle   a saint as well as a martyr   oh  she's watching us  i fancy she would like to come and join us  you know   only so she can filch the best bits off your plate   we might all end up like her   single  lonely  her position here the only thing to speak of in her life   makes me nervous when you pamper me   papa       will you do something for me   my darling  i wish your traps weren't so delightful   will you give me the ring   mother's ring   has moray spoken to you   you are not allowed to ask me that   when will i ever learn to say no to you   papa     when you are so old that your eyes water       i will hold your hand and kiss you every day   can i have it   if i could only make you see  that this rush to love       this is not going to make you happy   but you will let me have the ring   why  miss glendenning  ma'am  how pleasing to see you here   not that you shouldn't be here  i only meant that i hope we can please you   find something that might be pleasing  clara   come and attend to miss glendenning   i am told that i might find the latest fashions here   indeed  ma'am  perhaps i could show you the tea gown     i hope you're not suggesting that i could be seen on the street wearing a ready made dress   perhaps  miss glendenning  if you were to see the dress modelled   denise  you must put on the dress   quickly  girl  quickly   we dally at our peril   hurry up  girl   are you dawdling in there   miss audrey  this dress doesn't fit   let me see  let me see   you haven't even fastened it   do you not know how to wear a dress   oh  excuse me   i think it must be the wrong size  it won't go on properly   i cannot imagine why you would think i could wear such a thing   it is the model  madam   she does not know how to exhibit the dress properly  i have seen enough   thank you   ma'am  if i may  what does it matter how i look in the dress   it only matters how you will look in it   mr moray himself went to paris to seek out the latest fashion   i don't mind looking a fool in a dress two sizes too small   but i wouldn't be doing my job if i allowed you to leave without explaining to you  why you should buy it   you are rather forthright  girl   that is only because i believe you will look wonderful in this dress  ma'am   and if i am wrong       miss audrey will relieve me of my position   the dress is called the tea gown  ma'am   because it's worn without a corset   for comfort  for day time entertaining   the soft lines give the dress an especially feminine quality   in france  it is known as the  cinq a sept    the hours when a lady might receive suitors   it is beautiful  ma'am  with its lace edging and dome silk covered buttons   silk bows on the front and on the cuffs   i'm sure we could have it delivered to your home for you to try on  so you could see how it might look on you   in a month  this dress will be the talk of the town   just as it's the talk of paris now   i've already spoken to my partners   and they're all of one voice   retail makes them nervous   they prefer coal or shipping   but it is for you to decide  sir   come to the sale  and you will see what is possible   katherine's had suitors  some of them i liked   she showed no interest in any of them   i know my position  sir   i'm a salesman who has done rather well   i realise    don't toy with me  moray   you know that my daughter is infatuated with you   do you share katherine's feelings   i regard katherine most tenderly  sir   i must warn you   if you break her heart   whether or not i grant you a loan will be of no consequence   because i shall make it my business to ruin you   moray  for one last time  let me try to get you to stop this   i'd rather you put the champagne on ice   you joke about everything  you joke about this  you're a disgrace   look  look around you   these people  every one of them depend upon us for their work   how dare you   i created every job here   and i'll create more   all that matters is i fill this store for one day with customers   yes  we can grow   but why must it be done at such great risk   if you will not listen to reason     then what   then i will stop trying to reason with you     this new girl falling at her feet   i saw it the day she arrived   she's no innocent country girl   come on  i need a drink   what do you expect if you're stupid enough to get caught  lucille   have to get yourself a job   what are you suggesting  jonas   he met with some of your suppliers at the three crowns  sir   i've known dudley since we were boys   starting out together   there's no cunning in him   i could not get close enough to hear their conversation  without being noticed   but i know the landlord of the three crowns  and i passed him a small sum to help me with that   i was best man at his wedding   i sit at his dining table with him and his children   i find it almost impossible to doubt dudley   the point is  sir  he seems to doubt you   there were four suppliers there   he appeared to be warning them they may not get paid for the orders you placed with them   jonas   champagne   wasn't it you who told me that every occasion was made better by champagne   my mother's engagement ring   my father gave it to me after he spoke with you   it's beautiful   why would your father do such a thing   i can't bear it when you tease me   my father can see what we are skirting around   it is time   i know why this is difficult for a widower   it is time for you to be truly loved again   we will announce our engagement tomorrow and you will see how happy i can make you   why must you try to trap me   when have i ever suggested to you     i only want to love you   but you will not let me   you push me away   why   you make me love you but you taunt me with it  why   it hurts me     more than     i can bear   oh  god   i cannot breathe   please   help me   please   loosen my dress  please   no   yes   it's all right   denise  wake up  come and have a drink with us   what time is it   oh  look at her   snug as a chaste little virgin girl   what if anyone was to find you  pauline   don't worry about miss audrey  you can hear her snoring half way across the city   but that girl  lucille   she was fool enough to get caught  that's all   and she went right up to her  to katherine glendenning   and she said   in a month  this dress will be the talk of the town    and you  you hollow headed spoilt rich girl  you can't see that   i didn't say that  pauline   it's miss audrey  she's coming   someone has to go and talk to her  denise  get up  you're the only one sober  come on   girl   denise   what are you doing out here at this time of night   denise  girl   what is the matter with you   oh  miss audrey  denise walks sleeps   sleepwalks  she told me to watch out for her   sleepwalking  it's only her nerves  ma'am  it'll pass   i'm sorry if the noise woke you  miss audrey   you can go back to bed  leave denise to me  i'll settle her down again   sleepwalking   i knew i should never have taken on a girl from peebles   excuse me  mr dudley  sir  can i have a word with you   is everything all right with you  denise  mr dudley  sir   please don't do anything that you might regret   denise   you are to go to mr moray's office   at once   come in   i thought we might review your probation  denise   you know that there are a hundred girls out there that can take your place   come closer   do you like it here  i do  sir   then you'd like to remain at your post   it is a simple enough question  denise   i would  sir   your hair   it should have the slightest imperfection in it   something       suggestive   i heard you sold a dress to a rather difficult customer   you made a good impression   it seems you are quite the salesgirl   thank you  sir   so we can say your probation is over   and you're one of us now   thank you  mr moray  sir   is your display attracting customers   do you suppose i didn't see you hiding there   i see everything   it makes me smile to think of it   what kind of a girl has such spirit   you're not like the other girls  i think you know that   i wonder if you realise the talents you have   yes   if you have talent and wits  denise   you will do well here   to truly belong  you need loyalty   absolute loyalty   to the paradise and to me   thank you   tell me  what have you been up to behind my back  dudley   all i have done is try to save you from yourself   you've scared me  moray   you seem drunk with greed   tell me what you've done   i have arranged with our suppliers to return the goods if we cannot pay for them   these arrived this morning   they won't let me have anything more unless i pay on delivery   word will soon spread  others will follow   i didn't mean for this to happen   i only meant to prevent disaster   at least if we can return the goods  we won't be left with such terrible debts   if we are to triumph  a man must hold his nerve   you buckled   and now your weakness has jeopardised everything   why can you not see how wild the risk is   i see it   and i choose to go on   that is for me alone to decide   i need a loan    why is what we have not enough   this city is littered with men who stood still   if this sale is called off   all will be lost   i cannot turn back now   lord glendenning will come here on saturday   i need him to see the paradise bursting with customers   i'm sorry  moray   what can we do   go back to your friends   tell them to bring their goods   if i do not pay them     they can have this store   moray     you can't do such a thing  i can   because i must   mr moray has informed me that i am to be kept on  ma'am   i have passed my probation   is that so   well  never forget  girl  that this is my department  and i shall be watching you at all times   so be sure that you meet my standards  straighten your hair  girl  careless hair is a sin   girls  girls  we have work to do  we have a sale to prepare   step to it  step to it   it took me all my nerve to come here   i've been twice in the past week  but i was too scared to knock   clara  find yourself some kindly young man   i'm not stupid  i won't ask you for nothing   get some sleep  clara   isn't there some part of you  sir  can let me in   one night  that's all   like it was   no  clara  there isn't   not any more   do you think you're precious  you are nothing   he lay in my arms  do you hear me   he told me things   he lay in my arms sobbing and told me terrible things   wouldn't it be something if i were to tell the whole city how his wife died   wait until the store is filled with his beloved customers  then cry it out so they all hear it   clara  you wouldn't do such a thing  wouldn't i   can you guarantee they'll go on spending your money  'on your perfumes and fripperies '  'i want this to be our best day ever '  'i know you've been turned away by every bank in town  moray '  'this city is littered with men who stood still '  'yes  we can grow  but why must it be done at such great risk '  'the point is  sir  he seems to doubt you '  clara  when i went to moray's office   you were wrong to think that he likes me   he was kind to me  that is all   that is all  i've seen the way he looks at you   you'll be out on the street  just like lucille   worse  you need this work  clara   girls  girls  on a day like today   it is a sin even to pause for breath   denise  go and tell mr dudley our hat stands are hatless   seems you were right  moray   who would have imagined that shopping for goods would have such an effect upon women   this is only the beginning  sir   i want to bring a thousand undreamed of temptations  into the paradise   i promise you  sir  there will be no end to their appetite  however   it will take more than one spectacular event  to convince my partners at the bank   if i may  sir   you were never going to convince them  the point is to convince you   you see what is possible here   i'm asking you to lend me the money   that's a bold appeal  i ask it  only because i know your reputation is built on recognising  what other people do not see  and investing in it   will you be part of this   will you show your faith   there is another matter  sir   i wish to deal with this in your presence   katherine   i cannot be engaged to be married to you  not yet   it would be fatal for business  at this sensitive time   this enterprise relies on the charming of women   oh  dear  moray  you do love to exaggerate this romantic notion of yours  that women come here to be flattered by you  katherine   i must side with moray on this   you know my feelings   haste is the enemy of love   take your time   if i may  sir   i regret what happened  katherine   i cannot say how    regret   no  i do not want your regret   i    i cannot marry  katherine   i cannot say when i will be ready   if that makes you want to walk away from me  then you must   i'm not asking you to understand   i'm asking you to believe me   why does your wife have such a hold on you   why won't you admit that she is dead   uncle  what are you doing here  where did this come from   i made some commission  i sold a dress   do you think i want to be kept by him  it's my money  uncle   i worked for it  i should throw it in his face   let them all see how he trampled on the likes of me to build this fancy palace of nothings   then you'll be hurting me  uncle   i work here now  this is my place   i swore i'd never step inside of this place   mr moray would like the money brought into the store   all of it   why on earth does he want to do that   moray   you wish me to resign   i never want that to happen  dudley   we've come so far together to get here   i want you beside me   to support me   i want you to believe in the paradise  to believe in me   can you do that   i always have   i want to thank all of you   what you achieved  means the paradise can grow   that all of us will have work to come to  wages to live on   but more than that   what you conjured here  today  out of nothing   was thrilling   i promised you bonuses  and here they are   come and get them  you've earned every penny   you are in love with him   pauline  i don't want to marry moray   i want to be him   oh  katherine  this is a kind of heaven   girls say that sam is a naughty boy   a rogue  a charmer  a flirt  a ladies' man   if you did have a history of preying on women  it will come to light   it is best not to let them know what we're thinking   especially what we think of them
