you're attacking our friends and turning them into monsters   this is what i am     i hear you're on the wagon    wouldn't expect you to understand   then one night  i    decided to go for a walk     i was only scratched  i survived   mitchell  there's no escape from it   george  then why are we even trying     george  we have to protect the household   annie  you have just smashed up the household   you're a ghost   yeah  ok   mitchell  she can't be seen by humans   bad dog   herrick  this is nature  this is tectonic plates shifting     what did you do to her    you need to let her drink from you     mitchell  do something    not another one  i can't   and the only thing you and me get to choose  is which side we're on when it happens     mitchell  he should be dead within 30 seconds     the werewolf heart is about two thirds the size of a human's   but in order to shrink  first it has to stop   in other words  he has a heart attack     all the internal organs are smaller   so while he's having his heart attack   he's having liver and kidney failure too   and if he stops screaming  it's not because the pain has dulled   his throat  gullet and vocal cords are tearing and reforming   he literally can't make a sound   by now  the pituitary gland should be working overtime   flooding his body with endorphins to ease some of the pain   but that  too  has shut down   anyone else would have died of shock long ago  but it won't let him   and that's the thing i find most remarkable   it drags him through the fire  and keeps him alive and even conscious to endure every second   nothing like this could just evolve   this is the fingerprint of god   an impossible  lethal curse  spread by tooth and claw   victim begets victim  begets victim   it's so cruel  it's   perfect         man  how the hell do you get home   huh   you've got no clothes  no transport   i guess you ring someone   though god only knows where you keep the change for the phone     george  come back   george  i know what you are   what     what    i know what you are   and what   and what's that   a werewolf   that's     why     why would you say something like that   because i'm one  too   wait a second  george  i just want to talk     you gonna walk home like that  i brought some spare clothes   at least take them  you'll be arrested     where did you get them    what   the clothes   you say you transformed last night as well  but you're dressed   you've got these  how do i know you even are one of them   one of  them    this soon after your transformation  your senses are still in overdrive   sight  smell  hearing  all off the scale  and every one of them  is talking to you  screaming at you  that this is true   look  i've been doing this for years  and there's loads of things that i've discovered  not just the clothes   tricks of the trade  things that'll make it just a little bit easier   i don't want to make it easier   i don't want it to be something i accept and allow into my life   oh  no  sure  you're a single hospital porter   i bet your week's a round of ambassador's receptions   i have a life  i have friends  i live with some friends   i do   a ghost and a vampire  actually     vampire    oh  yes   they exist too  you know   yeah  i know they exist  i keep getting beaten up by the bastards   who are you  anyway     people call me tully    well  how did you find me   you're a werewolf living in bristol   it kind of narrows the field   why   why did you find me   because     safety in numbers   i hear stuff   something's about to happen   i figure that me and    we should stick together     what's about to happen    ask your friend   well  anyway   thank you for the clothes   but this   uh uh   don't try to follow me   we're done here   mitchell  george  excellent     let me introduce you to everyone    what    everyone  this is george   all  hello   he doesn't bite  well  only at a full moon   this is carol  from number 12  carol is a keen gardener  and a former miss isle of wight   this is lee from number 10  lee has been    working away   for the last 18 months and knows pretty much all there is to know  about vin diesel   for instance  did you know  that before his big break in pitch black  vin diesel wrote  two short films that were entered in the cannes and sundance film festivals   i did not know that   over here we have alfred and joyce   rory  imran and cassie  and they're doing    media studies      at the college  and    ooh  get this  right      cassie only has one kidney   she was born that way   nobody knows why   anyway  the rest you'll have to meet for yourself   what are all these people doing in our house    i've been thinking  this whole thing   getting the house    it was to participate  to join humanity   and what have we done  a few trips down to the pub  it's pathetic   this is what being human is about  this is what i chose     you chose    we chose  we all chose   we can't just dip our toe   we need to   dive in to the churn of humanity   laugh with them  listen to their stories   about vin diesel   a remarkable man  i'm starting to realise   it's a bit risky  isn't it   what's more suspicious   three shadowy  secretive people who never come out   never talk to anyone   or three friendly  welcoming guys   always nice and chatty  their door's always open   i don't mean just risky for us   we should hide in plain sight   stop being ashamed   invite the world in   oh   hi   hi  what the hell has brought this on   since becca died  he's barely left his room  barely said a word   now   now this     maybe he's had a blow to the head    i'm sorry   happened to my nan   she got hit in the head by a radio controlled plane at a county fair   from that moment   obsessed with pygmy goats   there wasn't a single bit of that sentence i understood   can they even see you   just you and mitchell   supernaturals  not humans  since i saw owen  i'm     i'm not here   i'm past tense   we have to put a stop to this   doesn't he understand  these people are british   you're not allowed to talk to your neighbours  until you've nodded at them for 15 years   just look at them  this must be absolutely terrifying   lee     the screenplay for pitch black  and in contrasting     oh  my bloody god   excuse me   sorry   fascinating  i'll be right back   go on  go on  more  more  more   i told you not to follow me   i didn't need to   i've known where you've lived for weeks   i was thinking about your friends  you know  i wanted to meet them   you   you are not meeting my friends   i am house trained  you know   i'm going to make this very simple   piss off   why  answer me that  george   why are you being like this   ohhh     i like to keep things separate   the house is the house  and the thing that happens to me  every month   that's something else   look  i transformed here last month  and it   it does not belong here  do you understand   what's your greatest fear   well  what do you think   that i'll bite someone   that i'll kill someone   then let me teach you how to manage the condition   i can make it safer for you   not just for you  for everyone   what is there to object to about that  hmm   everything all right  george   tully  i've been hitching round the south  sleeping rough     transforming in the countryside   anyway  couple of months ago   i find these clothes in the forest  all folded neatly   and i think   that's odd   and it was the day after a full moon   so my senses were still pretty sharp   and there's no mistaking that scent   so i spent the next two weeks in the library   looking over the local newspaper websites     what are you looking for    animal attacks   wolf attacks  anything like that  and i'm about to give up     when there it is  scotland   stirling gazette  2007    tourists attacked by wolf    so now i've got a name   i had a pretty good sense of the place he was using to transform   and it was just a case of biding my time   oh  so you've been sleeping rough   well  now and again someone will offer me a bed   though that usually means sharing     the earth my pillow  my canopy the stars   oh  i'd like to see george living like that   he had a panic attack in the eden project   the freedom is addictive  though it can be hard sometimes  you know   you know  what you've got here  you know  this   this sanctuary     i don't know  sometimes i'm my own worst enemy   tully is as tully does   oh  god    why are you laughing   i have no idea   i don't mean to stare   but i've seen people like you before  people who've passed over   but never so solid  so vibrant   you're not like a ghost       you're more like      a zombie   i was going to say an angel       can i ask you a question    please   there's not many vampires that would break bread with a werewolf   i'm lapsed   oh    a mirror reflects a man's face  but what he's really like   is shown in the kind of friends he chooses    proverbs  27 19   something like that   lapsed catholic   where are you sleeping tonight   in the arms of mother nature  as always   is just saying  outside  really that hard     why don't you stay with us    what   what    just for a couple of days  the sofa is the best we can offer   but it's warm and there's tea and a telly  what do you think  annie   mmm   i wouldn't wanna impose     oh  fair enough   you wouldn't be  he wouldn't be  you wouldn't be   well  i am fighting a cold     well  fresh air's the best cure     mitchell  then it's settled  who wants another beer   annie  so   how long have you been a werewolf  then   what the hell are you doing   i've told you  we need to embrace humanity  let the world in   yeah  but he isn't human   well  in that case  neither are you   it's annie i'm thinking of  she's very low at the moment  very     very vulnerable  having tully here  is putting her under a lot of strain already  you can see it     this whole     no  er  er  er    i've changed my mind     the deal   the deal's off    what deal   he said he can show me ways to manage the condition   and in return i said i'd let him meet you two     but that's great    it's not   because now it's here  isn't it bad enough this thing  happens to me once a month  can't i have somewhere i can hide from it   you get to hide for 27 days out of 28   that's pretty good going from where i'm standing   you know what this is   you've forgotten what it's like to see your own reflection    to be faced with yourself  what you are  every day   mitchell  the house is my way of coping   i want to close that door   i'm allowed to close that door and forget   i can't even believe we're having this conversation   if someone could teach me ways to control what i am   jesus christ   i'd jump at the chance         er   what's this   hey  morning   boys have gone to work  thought i'd make you some breakfast   dunno whose eggs they are   i used to live with some boys  and the flaming rows we had about  who ate whose food     oh  i can't eat    what   i can't eat  or drink   it's just  i'm   dead   oh  my god   oh  no  don't worry  oh  no  it's ok  it's fine   well  it's bonkers  really   so  er  how did you sleep   yeah  like a baby   do you   can i ask   do you sleep   er   mitchell says i should try  even if it's just a doze   he says it would do me good  but i don't know   don't think i want to     why    well  i might dream   seems a shame to waste it   do you mind if i get stuck in   can i watch you   watch me eat   it's    when i was with owen  sometimes i'd wake up  really early  come down  have my tea and my cereal   and then i'd make his breakfast   he'd come down and sit with me and we'd talk  while he ate the breakfast that i made for him   the boys    i don't know  i've never asked  but that would be weird   but with you  i     oh  god  i'm sorry  this is so silly  i'm really sorry  sorry   please  please   i'd like that   i'd like that   ok     woman  and you can stop right there   who's this   um  mrs james   mm hm  and she is on my ward because   dr newell in a e said it was all arranged   hi  mrs james   mrs james  i'm nina  i'm the  er  acting ward sister   look  um  i'm gonna get sasha here to make you a nice cup of tea   just while i sort all this out  all right   here's the thing  dr newell is a cock   this has been proven by scientists   look  we haven't got any beds  ok   he knows this because he called me  and i told him we haven't got any beds   but see  he's gone ahead and discharged her from a e  and sent her here anyway   by now  somebody else will be in mrs james's bed  leaving her  without portfolio      so where do i take her    what's your place like   what   i don't know  it could be the start of something  she has a twinkle   i   i can't take her home   tip for the future  right   if you ever think a doctor is lying  check if their lips are moving   look  just turn around  walk away   i will sort this   look  look  i i'm sorry if     how long have you worked here   about a year   oof  then you should know better   george  ok  let's get this over with   lesson one   preparation  for a safe  stress free transformation   it's all about the preparation   is this going to take long   what we need first   spare set of clothes     wet wipes      er  wet wipes   to clean yourself up in the morning   bananas  in case you haven't eaten during the night   oh  has your stomach adjusted yet   how do you mean   the wolf stomach can digest raw meat in a way the human stomach can't   first few months  when i transformed back     i'd throw up all these animals i'd killed  urgh     there's a lovely thought    what   well  even after i've changed back  i'm still   changed   there's nothing i can do about it   water for rehydration  emergency pound for the phone   mitchell must have suggested some of this   no  it's not really his thing  what's the other bag for   double bagging   you always double bag  george   george  oh  where the hell are we going   is this going to take long  ow   couldn't i just transform in here   too risky  perfect place to leave your wet wipes and clothes   but you can't stay here   why not   buy some padlocks for the door  it's ideal   what if someone hears you  rings the police    there's some animal locked in a shed    police turn up  guns  tranquilisers  you're trapped   no  you're safer outside  where you can make a quick getaway   what about everyone else   it's not safer for them with me running all over the countryside   you won't be  check this out   what's that   it's a chicken on a piece of string   and that helps us how  exactly   we take it for a walk   ok     using the shed as a centre point   we walk in a circle  a mile or so in diameter  dragging this behind us   once you've transformed you'll skulk around a bit   till eventually you'll pick up the scent of the chicken   if you follow it   it'll just take you in a wide circle and you won't stray beyond   you're safe  everyone's safe   admit it   you're impressed   right  check list         something inside of me    feels like i've been wanting you for ever    there'll never be another century    there's no time to think about the weather    when there's something inside of me    there's something inside of me    something inside of me    and now i can't look back    the invisible invasion    it's like a stranger strangled on the moor    into the void for now i'm gone    five in the morning       come on  slow coach  hurry up   come and see  look  look  look    over there  a deer          something inside of me    something inside of me    and now i can't look back     that's mad   that is so funny       wouldn't go in there for a while     oh     lauren  morning   you   gonna let me in   you have to invite me across the threshold   that is such a mental rule  who made that up   you   you are not coming in here   yeah  i think i am   cos i don't think you want this conversation happening on your doorstep   ah  hiya  how's it going   oh  for christ's sake  come in   ooh  this is nice  i like the open plan thing  very '70s   when will you leave me alone   mitchell     jesus   i can't breathe   you're killing me     oh  no  wait  you already did that     you're still pissed off with me for killing your friend     she was 20 years old    so was i   are you planning on letting me go  only  this is quite expensive    what are you doing here   herrick's already cut me off from the rest of the vampires  if he     why does this have to be about herrick   you're obsessed with each other  it's totally gay   so what do you want   i miss you   i've been thinking about the night you took me   how we barely made it to my bed   and how     at first   it hurt     and i was frightened   but then afterwards   everything  all the world   as sharp as a pin   and the blood  mitchell  can you remember the taste   so rich and warm   you can have it again  as much as you want   i    i   i can't   the cost is too high   please   who are you saving  really  have you seen britain's got talent   besides   we don't need to feed   we can just   play   i'm not very good at keeping them separate   so you're a monk now as well   ahh  this isn't something you     you don't come to a compromise about this  i chose humanity   yeah  i want to believe you  i really do   it's just when you look at me    you're hungry   oh  get out     just let it take you  mitchell  give in to it   i said get out   you don't get it  do you   it's like hotel california  you can check out  but you can never leave     ooh  i like your stars   when was the last time you got it wet   got what wet   oh  my god  that's disgusting   i don't know  a couple of years   not since i   you know  got the thing   a couple of years  jesus  we need to get you out there  boy   mmm    i've never been very confident with all of that   let me tell you  this whole thing    women like men who talk about their feelings and kittens    bullshit     really    yeah   they want something naughty  a bit savage  a bit rufty tufty   guys like me and you  christ  talk about having an advantage   three weeks ago you were quoting the bible and doing origami   yeah  well  that's charm  there's a difference  here  check this out     what time do you close    three  maybe four   yeah  you could take me out for a drink this evening     ha  i could take you for a drink    yeah   but i'm gonna need your phone number  and i guess you got an early start   so we'd better have you in bed by   what  nine    shut up   i'm serious    maggie   i like that   she can smell the wolf   she's helpless  it's primeval   it's about the confidence  yeah   it's about being a predator  that's the secret  george   mitchell's the same  you must have had this conversation   not really   no   that surprises me   the man's clearly a poon hound  i wonder why he hasn't helped you   i guess it's the competition   this has to stop   i cannot do another conversation about vin diesel   you just need to get him onto another subject   i've tried   leonard cohen  darcey bussell   it's like he isn't interested   it's good we're doing this   especially now   throwing the doors open like this  it sends a message   what do you mean   especially now    nothing  it  er  came out wrong   george  and sends a message to who   is there something you're not telling us   like what   what   a few weeks ago  tully was in london and got attacked by some vampires   vampires are arseholes  this is hardly news   yes  but tully says it's happening more and more   like suddenly they've stopped    hiding   but it's the things they're saying now about time   how their time is coming   vampires have been saying their time is coming since the crusades   every now and then someone gets everyone all excited     it never comes to anything   so something has been happening   it's nothing  can we     it's nothing  i promise you   i need a wee   well  i feel totally reassured    oh  hello    hello     who are you    hannah   i'm  er  with suzie     who's suzie    she lives at number eight   you knocked on her door  said you were having people over   right   only  everyone's gone     has suzie gone    they've all gone   how long have you been up here   ok  so what happened was  i cut my finger  and the guy you live with         the one who was putting coasters  under everything  told me there was plasters here   and then i felt a bit woozy so      are you ok   is it    oh  is it the blood   er  well  what did you do   i volunteered to cut some cake  which was  in hindsight  an error   oh  it's right on the foldy bit  it's taking forever to heal   there's  er  blood on my t shirt   do you think i should run it under the tap   why don't we get you downstairs and find you a plaster or something   oh  george   you know the isolation room you were using to transform in   yeah   now the site office for the building work   health and safety said it's unsuitable   it's too remote and there's no windows   site officer kept bursting into tears every time he went there     so    so     after next week you can start using it again  to transform in   oh  i don't know   i think i'm better off curled up in the lap of mother nature   right   what   i thought you said changing out in the open is dangerous   look  don't try to understand george   george  george who   me   so  carol from number 12 is gonna lend us casablanca   why     i'm only in it    get out   yeah  i'm just an extra  in the bar   and you can't actually see me  obviously   but i do knock over a chair at one point and you can see that   you were in casablanca   how did you swing that   i know people  i move and shake   i can think of better ways to spend an evening  than watch you knock a chair over  oh  you've changed your tune   you love old movies   hey  george is as george does   did you really just say that   did you actually say those words   oh  my god  you're tully's mini me   yes     mitchell  yes     why a hospital    sorry   well  you know  i was just wondering  you've got a brain the size of a planet   why would you wanna be a porter in a shitty hospital   it was mitchell's idea  he's not great with sunlight   and a hospital   you can walk for miles without seeing natural light   also  a porter  a cleaner  they're both very low profile jobs     it's easier to hide this way    hide from what   everything   what   ah  just strikes me he's got a bit of an investment  in keeping you like this   keeping me like what   hey  jesus  there you are   god  i've been looking for you for days now   you have   i didn't know your name  so i'm like   he's a porter  about this tall    actually  i realise i was making you too tall   anyway  look  i just wanted to say    the other day     i was being a wanker   you know  a doctor tells you to do something  you've gotta do it   and i appreciate that   so   i'm sorry   that's fine   really  thank you   ok    mate  j     tully  nina  wasn't it  i like that   sorry   nina  what was that   did you say something   so   what time do you finish   uh  nine   ish  why   you can take me for a drink   why would i do that   yes  good question   um   i i'll be needing your number   and i i assume you have an early start   so we   should have you in bed by 11   oh  my god  are you     is     is this you asking me out  is that what's happening here   you can show me just how sorry you are   ok   w   what   i said  ok   but this week's no good  you know  because  um  well   it's my dirty lady time   but you know  next week  next week should be perfect   tremendous   mmm  besides  i've always wanted to do it with a porter   are you serious   am i serious  does a chicken have teeth   i don't know if it's the polyesterjacket   or the whole   minimum wage thing   but to meet one that not only hates women   but attempts to humiliate them in front of his friend as well   oh  man     so you know what i'm gonna do   i'm going to tell all my friends about you  mmm   so don't be surprised if you start getting a lot of attention  from the nurses now   mate  you were amazing   really   because it just felt like it went really badly   are you crazy  you're a teen wolf   does a chicken have teeth   it kind of has ridges  they're like teeth   trust me  my friend  you're gonna be holding her off with a taser   blimey     oh  gosh  you made me jump   i never see you out of those clothes   oh  er     they're what i was wearing the night i     it's just as well i wasn't in a star trek costume or  you know   dressed   as a     squirrel   ooh  you're all   squishy   you're cold  you're like snow   that   that actually hurts     how can it hurt    owen       what    er   tully   please  that   that hurts   i'm just messing with you  kid   er  so  what do you want   company  a kind word  respect   oh  you have those things   ah  what i have is a lumpy sofa   balls like concrete and a corpse giving me mixed signals   your face   i told you  i'm just messing with you   though you have got tully's imagination working overtime   i'm wondering what else you could feel   oh  er  well  no  actually  it didn't hurt   it's more like i saw you holding my arm and it felt like it should hurt   so  er   could you     would it be possible if you just moved back  just a little bit     could you feel a kiss    oh  i don't know  er       could you feel a fuck    oh  gosh   this is making me feel very uncomfortable now   then i think it's about time we went upstairs   shit   excuse me  i need to get to hospital  i need to see my frien     excuse me  i need to get to the hospital  i need to see my

nice   did you feel anything   yeah   yeah  i felt something   another trick  depending on your surroundings   is to choose somewhere bound on one or more sides by water   you can't cross water when you're in wolf state   mmm   this  now     this is my favourite time   the eve  you can feel the transformation brewing   it's like nature has folded you into something   hard and powerful   i feel

how it happens   it's all slotting into place   click  click  click   you can feel it too  can't you   the fire in your gut  the expectation   the hunger     it frightens me    give in to it   drown in it   let him in  the big  bad wolf   oh  my friends     will never   understand   you   but you do   better than you think   and you won't go   how could i  george   it's taken me two years to find you   two   two years  what do you mean   i'm the one who attacked you   i'm the one who gave you this gift   what    i don't remember what happened that night  but then i saw it in the paper     that someone had died  and that   that the other person had survived     and i knew     i knew  and then it gave me the idea   and   and the thought of you   and every time i closed my eyes     that's     no  that's     that's not true     oh  george  i was gonna tell you straight away  i almost did   why didn't you    it's   it's a complex thing  it's a glorious thing   this isn't a glorious thing  it's a curse   this isn't a gift  it's god stamping on us with his boot   ok  let's   let's  let's go     shall we go for a drink   why didn't you tell me    because i needed you to need me first   i saw what you had   and   and i wanted that too   everything you've said     this whole time     has been a lie     i'd lost everything  i had a wife and a son and i lost them   i   i just needed to find the last human that i had a connection with   i had a son   i i had a son     george  don't leave me  george   i can't be alone any longer   please  george   where's tully   gone   i'm sorry   i really am     so sorry   i don't know what's happening to me   this is becoming a habit   i come in here  look at the wreckage and i say sorry   what's that you've got there   eh  oh  i don't know  it was on the floor as i came in   i assume it's mitchell knocking over a chair in casablanca   ooh  cool  i'm gonna pop it on   my name's george     and i'm a werewolf   hello  george   just to warn you  if you go in for a hug  mitchell will try to kiss you   my god  i leave you alone for five minutes     it's like being attacked by an ironing board   if i had intended to kiss you  i'd have put on some chapstick first   what the hell is this   he's not humphrey bogart   george  who's he talking to   is he a mental   brown duvet   it's a cry for help   he's talking to a vampire   their image can't be captured on camera   oh  my god  are we     watching someone have sex   turn it off   annie     turn it off       george  someone has issues     is he all right     he's dead    annie  what    no  no  no  look  he is moving   she's feeding from him   who would send you such a thing     it's from lauren    you're kidding   what  that   that was her  in the film   i've seen these before  it's a kill   vampires film themselves making a kill and then they pass it on   annie  so  what  it's like porn     in a way    why do they do it   same reason anyone does porn     so that's supposed to be sexy    for some   but this is different  this is   personal   it's to remind me of what i did to her   it's to show you what you're missing  mitchell   it's to bring you back   i knew you would come back       i'm not gonna let you go   let me go  get off  get off me  get off me   tully  i can't live like this any more   george  we're about to transform  full moon   we'll tear each other apart  get off   argh   george  no  no               the first time we met  you didn't know what you were doing   i understand that   the second time     there won't be a third   this is you now   there's no cure  there's no way out   it's in every cell   the only thing left is your conscience   but there'll come a time when you'll surrender that too     when you use what you are   you're wrong   you can check out  but you can never leave     did you really throw up at the dvd   only the first dozen or so times   so i'm contemplating resolving my death  so that i can move on to the next dimension  and you're worrying about getting your leg over   oh  god  oh  god   what  what    i just can't   you mean you've got a problem
