 synchro  michvanilly  tyno transcript  chocolate   welcome to manchester airport  in the interests of security     it's a message from peter   he went white water rafting this morning and his canoe capsized   he had to be rescued     what are you doing    i'm calling him   he's all right  isn't he   what if he's cut himself on a rock or something  it could get infected   abby  you promised you wouldn't make a fuss   we'll call him this evening  like we said  ok   a virulent flu virus is sweeping britain   leaving medical services struggling to meet demands for vaccinations   tell us about cyprus  then  was it dead romantic   sexy as hell   abby spent most of the time in the hotel texting peter   i was worried about him  it's only been a few months   but he's all right now  isn't he  he looks really well   he's in total remission  100  well   he's a normal  healthy little boy   yeah  but we'll always have to be careful   that doesn't mean we treat him like an invalid   i'm sick of talking about leukaemia   it's mad   this bloody flu business   half the country's off sick   we should have taken peter for a jab before he went     he'll be fine up where he is    miles away from anywhere   best place to be   drink plenty of fluids  and avoid contacting a health professional except in an emergency   mummy's ill     a lot of people are ill    you're not   neither are you  we're lucky  aren't we   daddy   sorry  i couldn't get a bus     you're hot    i've been running  sweetheart   i've got to get back  her mum's in bed   there's no school tomorrow  we think it best if the

all day in a cell with you  yeah  it's a nightmare     nelson mandela had it easy    hear most of the screws are off sick   it's a flu epidemic   don't you read the papers   there's this rumour about early release  for who's got less than two to go   there ain't enough screws to keep the prison open   do you actually believe that   well  i was just saying   well  don't   you're embarrassing yourself   we need to get a press statement out as soon as possible   tell the media i'm taking personal responsibility for the flu crisis   and don't call it a crisis   downplay the infection rate  concentrate on the good news   health professionals doing a magnificent job   people pulling together to beat the bug  that type of thing   i'm arranging photo calls for you   if we hurry we can get a shot of you having the flu jab    on the six o'clock news    good   the pm wants me to be as visible as possible   he's keen to show we're being proactive     how is he    bad tempered   i was really hoping to get away this weekend   that's not going to happen  we're getting more cases by the hour   jack's going to kill me  he's booked a hotel   you couldn't phone him for me  could you  mark   he won't shout at you    the european flu continues to spread throughout the uk   today  government agencies are issuing warnings  of serious disruptions to all domestic utilities  due to high levels of absenteeism caused by sickness   peter  it's mum   are you ok   you're all fit and well up there   i love you too  honey   hello   i can't stay long  i've got to get frank to the doctors   has he got this bug   of course it's worse for him than anyone else   you know what men are like  it's the old folks you worry about   it always hits them hardest   thanks   listen  helen   i was wondering about coming back to work  i know it's been a while but       how is your peter now    he's fine  he's absolutely fine   i never wanted you to go   not many of my girls handled the salesmen so well   they all ask for you   that's cause they were all trying to get into my knickers   you know what they're like     you're sure you're ready to come back    absolutely   i'll put in a word   do you think she's all right   she ought to be home in bed  poor love   the european flu crisis deepened today  with much of the uk's population  now affected by the virulent strain   the effects of the epidemic wreaked  havoc on britain's transport network today   and there are further     three hours for a 20 minute journey   it's crazy  the whole country's grinding to a halt   have you heard from peter   i spoke to him earlier and he sounded a bit strange   strange  how   i don't know  like  he didn't want to talk   well  maybe he wanted to go out and play     what    the job   yeah  it went well     helen thinks she can swing it    that's great   look  don't be angry with me   but i  i think something was wrong with him   ok  i'll stop worrying   i'm going up for a bath   i'll get you a drink   sounds wonderful   in a statement  the prime minister said everything possible  was being done to confront the emergency   the state of emergency is still being discussed in cabinet   you mean by any minister left standing   the pm is reluctant to put troops on the streets     he feels that should be a last resort    what stage does he think we're at now     i have to give the media more    the problems are unprecedented   there hasn't been an outbreak of this severity since 1918  that kind of thing   can i at least announce that the army is on stand by   what is this   it came from the chief medical officer's people a few moments ago   strictly confidential  i'm trying to get clarification    the impact of the virus is more severe than early tests indicated      what does that mean    no one seems to know   they said the implications are very serious   when was this   you should have phoned us  you know his medical history   what is it   we'll be there as soon as we can   it's nothing serious  he's just a bit unwell   i knew something was wrong  we have to get him to hospital   it's not the cancer  it's flu   how do they know that  he shouldn't even be there     should have brought him home    doesn't matter where he is   he'd still have caught it   why did i ever listen to you  why was i so stupid   i'm sorry     bloody hell  you're on fire    i'm fine  let's just go     we'll never make it all the way there    we can get petrol somewhere else     sorry  it's urgent    i've been waiting half an hour   it's my son  he's ill   yeah  who isn't  get in line   and wait like everyone else  you're bloody queue jumping  mate     i was here first    just leave it   you bloody idiot  what's wrong with ya   what's wrong   it feels like my head's gonna explode   why didn't you say something   let's just get peter   let's get you home  get you a doctor  then i'll come back for peter  ok   come on   i don't feel good   i'm bloody hot   my arm   it really hurts   we need help in here   what do you want  price     coyne's sick    everyone's sick     he needs a doctor    there is no doctor   he went down with it this morning   there's nothing i can do   you can't just leave me in here with him   i'll catch it as well   upstairs   all right  charlie   champagne  cristal     what's your name    simone   that's a cute name   i'm al   the first official cases of european flu  have been reported in washington and beijing   we're getting reports of localised power outages  the tube system is virtually at a standstill     picture's the same over the country    what are we doing   people don't expect the national infrastructure to collapse   none of our contingency plans allowed for it spreading so quickly   we have to isolate infected people  quarantine them if necessary     it's already too late for that    what do you mean   virtually the entire population has already been exposed   the virus is much more aggressive than early tests indicated   by the time symptoms begin to show   the body's immune system has already been severely compromised   compromised   it goes into meltdown   in effect   the body's attacking itself     you stay away from me    for god's sake  man   help me   i need someone in here  now   will you stop staring at me   i'm doing the best i can   what's going on   it must be a power cut   there are candles in the hall cupboard   i've got a lump under my arm     what are you doing    calling the doctor   come on   no  just leave me  i just need to lie down   look  we're gonna have to drive you there  just try for me   i just need to go to sleep   here you go  pat   try and get this down you  it will make you feel better   please  jen  just get anya   she'll know what to do  i've called the hospital  sweetheart   they said she'd get back to us when she could   please   are you all right     you're gonna have to walk    i'm scared   please  it's not that far  come on   just a bit further   come on   just stay here   excuse me   can you page dr anya raczynski for me  please   tell her it's jenny   dr anya raczynski  please come to reception immed     emergency services are doing extremely well   fresh vaccines are being distributed  and the we have opened up a record number of hospital beds   how can you say that when you know that hospitals all over the country  are closing their doors   nobody denies the seriousness of the situation   but we are confident we're handling it well   it's true that the government has lost control   we're a very long way from that situation   i didn't know what else to do   come with me   in here   give me a minute     you're not allowed in there    how many   hundreds   in the last few hours alone  it's the same everywhere   the virus     causes our own immune systems  to turn against us   it rips our natural defences to shreds   some people can fight it for longer  but in others     it moves so quickly   what about the jab   useless  fiction to keep the panic under control   it takes years to develop effective vaccines   we've had days   pat   i can't help her   is there a vaccine yet   our immediate hope lies in prevention   my advice to the public is to stay home  and avoid contact with each other as much as possible   minister  we are getting credible reports that people are dying   i think we have to treat internet speculation  with a degree of suspicion at this point   is it true that the prime minister himself is ill   i briefed him a few hours ago and he was fine   then why won't he talk to us   he's coordinating the government's response   i'm sure you wouldn't expect anything less   i'd like to invite general mike stone  to explain the practical aspects of the state of emergency   thank you  minister   the army's first priority will be the maintenance of essential services     not bad   you're dropping   yeah  it's the dancing   i need a shower   through there   drink   yeah  vodka   so you must be pretty rich   you know  not compared to some   you should see my uncle's place in new york   what are you  saudi   my dad is kuwaiti   mum's english   al doesn't sound like an arab name   well  it's short for aalim   al's easier   there's nothing to be gained from rumours and hearsay   the hard information suggests the emergency services  are coping extremely well   keep up  najid  we must stick together   we must pray to be spared from this terrible sickness   there's nothing to be scared of   if anything happens   if somehow you find yourself alone   tell the authorities you have cousins in blackburn   you can't go to sleep with your hair wet   you'll catch your death   there must be some hope   there are bound to be some people who are naturally immune   the lucky ones   if you can call them that   why shouldn't you   can you     imagine what their lives will be like now   how scared and lonely they'll be   but     whatever happens   i'd rather live   perhaps you will   if you stay well for another few days   jen   my head hurts and i'm     i'm too hot   and there's a lump   i was having such a strange dream   well  you're awake now   does it hurt anywhere   it feels like i'm floating  it's quite nice     i can't breathe    it's ok     no  i'm too hot    try to relax  it's ok   i'm so scared   abby  don't do this     for years  medical experts have predicted a global flu pandemic   but even they are surprised by the speed and scale of the outbreak   this is it   this is what i'm supposed to tell them   i think that's up to you now   the prime minister died a few minutes ago   how many millions   if the infection carries on progressing at the current rate   we're talking more than 90  of the world's population   tell everyone to go home as soon as the press conference is finished   they should be with their families now  you too   of course  jack   she's right here     thank you    better hurry   i don't think the mobile networks will last much longer   thank you  mark   you've done a remarkable job   it's been a privilege working with you  minister   sorry i couldn't call earlier  it's just     all of you   the boys too   are they in bed   good   no  i'm fine  i'll be home soon   of course everything's going to be all right  it's just a nasty bug   i love you   i can no longer disguise from you the fact that we are facing a very  grave crisis   during this period of uncertainty it is possible  there will be temporary losses of power and water   i urge you all to behave responsibly   to be good neighbours  and to avoid panic   as soon as is practically possible   your government will restore services  and normalise the situation   rest assured we continue to work on your behalf   in the meantime   good luck   and god bless you all   come

sort you out   all right   hello   peter   it's ok  i didn't mean to frighten you   i should have said something  sorry     have you had the illness    it never touched me     have you    i recovered   i'm callum brown  i'm one of the instructors here   well  i was   don't take this the wrong way  mr brown   but i think you might be the most beautiful man i've ever seen   peter was one of the first boys who fell ill   of course  at that point  we didn't know what was coming   i spoke to him in the morning  i knew something was wrong   in the end  phil emerson decided to drive him down to the hospital  and i stayed behind here with the other kids   but he was still alive when they left   he was very sick  mrs grant   and no one else has recovered     but i did    you're the only one   but you don't know   you don't know for certain that he's dead   no  i don't   i have to go   he could be out there right now  i've got to get to that hospital     you can't drive now  you're exhausted    i'm fine   no  it's too dangerous at night now  there are no lights   stay tonight  rest   mum   i'm home   that's phil emerson with peter   take it   so  what will you do now   well  i'll have to bury the boys now   and then  i'll climb in the peaks   walk a little   life won't be so very different   not many of us can say that   that way of life is gone now   mobile phones  computers  the electricity that powers them   all gone for good     we'll soon get things working again    do you think so   when was the last time you did anything truly practical  mrs grant     like what    like milked a cow   or slaughtered a pig  or  you know  grew a vegetable   i mean  do you know what mushrooms are ok to eat  and which ones will kill you   that's the kind of knowledge you're going to need now   we still have books  we can learn what we need from them   well  we're gonna need to  and soon   there must be millions of tonnes of preserved food left   a huge stockpile of things   cars  clothes  petrol     yeah  but how long d'you think that's going to last   we'll have to start all over again   relearn the skills we've forgotten   we've become like helpless babies   pushing the buttons of our fancy technology whilst distancing ourselves  further every day from the reality of what it actually is to be human   perhaps i have more faith in people than you do   we can save ourselves  all right   but the work starts now   and mobile phones won't help   well  i'm going to hang on to mine for now   just in case   hi  where are you headed   i don't know  just out of here
