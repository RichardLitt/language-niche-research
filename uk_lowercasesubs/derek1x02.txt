 why is everyone weird in here   'i know it's not a great hairstyle  it's not a style   'i don't style it like this  this is how it is '  what i find strange is the way it's never come into fashion   when you think of all the different things that have come  and gone   platform shoes and long sideburns  dungarees   this has never been picked up  no heart throb in a hollywood  film has ever had this  and i just feel like that that just sums  it up  that's    i'm sort of unlucky in life   i've got a shit haircut  forget it  you're not gonna get anywhere   yeah  i'd shave it off  or wear a wig if i was you   what difference would it make to me life   seriously   your head would be warmer   good point   well  the bedrooms are just through this way   you're gonna help me make some beds   oh  that's nasty  do you have to touch anything   well  yeah   do you wear gloves   what  to change beds   yeah  but old people bed  though   well  i think it's better to save the gloves for when you're doing  the urinals  otherwise you don't really feel the benefit   fuck's sake   do you answer your parents back like that   no one to answer back to  we don't talk too much   well  did you used to talk to your teachers like that then   yeah  all the time   dickheads   except for mr matthews who was quite fit   but didn't really go to school much anyway   i didn't do that well at school  you know   you can learn loads of stuff outside school   you're never too old to learn something   do you read   yeah   what do you read   twitter   well  ok     she's not a bad kid  she's just never been told she'd amount to  anything  she's never had any role models  like teachers and authority  figures  it's all celebrities now  innit  and footballer's wives   still  you know  i wouldn't mind a bit of david beckham   so long as he didn't speak   wouldn't want him to speak  he'd be mute   a mute beckham would be lovely   oh  fuck     they're having a laugh  in't they   that is disgusting   looks like it could still bite me hand off   well  where do you get your nails done   did 'em myself   really   yeah  duh   you're cleverer than me   well you can't be very clever then cos i'm thick   don't

library   we're going to the library  take some books back  get some books out   once a week  and then read them  bring 'em back   take 'em back out again  innit   dougie takes us to the library  don't you   it's just to get them out the home  really   some of them don't bother getting a book   hannah says  you know  get 'em out  give 'em a bit of fresh air   which is funny  really   when

nod off   they might as well be back in the home   but then again  you know   when you're their age  are you really going to start reading books   they might not get through it   anyway  i don't know
