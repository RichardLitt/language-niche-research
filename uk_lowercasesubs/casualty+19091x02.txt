i'll do my very best   before antibiotics   the nhs  when life expectancy is 45  when 1 in 7 children died by the age of 10  the london hospital is on the frontline  dramatised from hospital records  private papers   newspaper reports   day after day  day after day   we stuck  nor breath nor motion   as idle as a painted ship  upon a painted ocean   water  water  everywhere   and all the boards

bandage   thank you  nurse     are you still doing this    mrs  anderson toppled into the thames   cleaning the wound of the mud was itself a major operation   dr  ingrams   i could have reset all ten

no good  doctor  it's no good   there  there   i have been profoundly impressed  by the way stovaine seems to have abolished  the condition of surgical shock   in a way that chloroform and ether does not   now  for those of you familiar  with testicles  but unfamiliar with carcinoma   feast your neophyte eyes   how is your tea  mr  lawrence  not too hot   perfect brew  doctor  just right   observe how the possibility of surgical shock   which was previously common  in abdominal surgery  has been all but eliminated  by the use of stovaine anaesthesia via lumber injection   and thus    scalpel  please       we can relieve mr lawrence of his carcinoma  with little more physiological distress  or personal discomfort than say  er   clipping his toenails   you've given mrs  anderson a change of clothes  i see     yes  sister    and hot coffee   now here are two half crowns from the christmas fund   oh  i can't thank you enough  truly     thank the kind soul who donated this  by spending it on health giving provisions  mrs  anderson     not gin    the lord be my witness   i shall  sister   i shall   assistance   a cabbie dropped her off outside  sister   said she'd taken drain cleaner   gently   feel that   can you remember the last time you felt anything in your  arm or in your hand and fingers  joe   about a week ago   dr  culpin  there's an emergency   take precise details and  and make an appointment for joe to see dr  head in neurology   i understand   what's wrong with him  miss   well  i think it's     that's what the doctor is going to find out   prepare a treatment of diluted lemon juice   one ounce juice to five ounces water     yes  doctor    and some olive oil to bathe  her stomach  she is hot  has she vomited     not since admission    let's try and keep it that way   her oesophagus will be burnt enough from the ingestion of the caustic soda   so   flush the scalds around her mouth with sterilised water   though i suspect they'll prove the least of her woes   doctor   if she took soda she obviously     our job is to try and save her life  sister russell   not speculate on why she may have tried to end it   nurse goodley   any discomfort from the operation or the catheter  mr  lawrence   no  i can't feel a toffee   mr  dean is one of the best   bed number three  please  porter   mr  dean even had one of his students trim my toenails   schwester   please  mein kopf   excuse me   my head is killing me   aprendiz  will you fetch an ice cap for mr  stoll   danke   es tut so weh   bitte helfen sie mir  please   mein kopf     will her stomach recover   yes  a full or partial recovery is to be expected   though strictures are a distinct possibility   now  we invert the funnel     we do this why   to carefully siphon out the stomach's contents   precisely   matron would like to see you  nurse bennett  in her office   why   no doubt miss luckes will explain everything   she must have indicated why i'm being summoned     she didn't    but do you know why     no    ada   i swear  ethel   sister   who is it   nurse bennett   take a seat   may i ask who reported it     the cabbie who brought her in    christian fellow  no doubt   we don't make the law  sister  we're simply charged with upholding it   the ingestion of caustic soda is not of itself proof  of attempted suicide   you know as well as i do   the only people who knowingly take it are those who seek to kill themselves   which is against the law   i do respect your position   i'm asking you to understand mine   may i ask if my work has been found wanting in any way   on the contrary   the daily reports i receive from sister russell  show you to be a great asset to the receiving room   then i'm afraid i don't und     it's my understanding that it's the nurses who struggle on the wards  who are traditionally put out to private nursing   the london has many patients  rich and poor   don't they all deserve to be cared for by our best staff   yes  but with all due respect  my place is in the receiving room   nurse bennett  your place is wherever i say it is   do i make myself clear   yes  matron   details of the location and nature of your first four patients   with letters of introduction to each   now finish your day in the receiving room   and start your first appointment at 8am tomorrow    the reverend j edwards of tooting    condition    haemorrhoids    remember to warm your hands   oh  come on   come on  this is the last thing this woman needs   i'm arresting you on suspicion of attempted suicide  and ask you to accompany me to the station   she's in no fit condition to accompany you anywhere   if she can walk  she can walk with me   up you get  miss  come on   there we go   mind your feet  come on   i'm sorry  i'm sorry  i       i can't allow this    dr  culpin     please move out of the way  doctor    come on  man  come on   you could caution her here and now and no one would be any the wiser   but the law would be poorer for me turning a blind eye     you believe that    please  step aside     it's immoral    i'm a policeman  not a philosopher   dr  culpin  there's nothing we can do   thank you  sister   good day  doctor   dammit   how was he overnight     he woke four times  crying    poor lad   chronic empyema  gentlemen   from the greek      empyein   meaning suppurating or pus producing   in this case from a tubercular abscess  treatment   surgery   surgery  question mark   presumably you would hand a broken timepiece to a clockmaker   with the similarly detailed instruction   fix it    how are your young blades today  henry  sharp   could be sharper   indeed   we can all always be sharper  gentlemen   thank you  sister   knowledge is the ever expanding horizon   learning is our endless march towards it  come   and how are we today  mr  stoll   ein bisschen better  i think  doctor   good   good  that's what we like to hear  is there any discomfort   no  only with the headache   persistent or does it come and go   they come and go   persistent   mr  stoll has complained of severe headaches  since the stovaine wore off  mr  dean   how severe  mr  stoll   i don't like to kvetch   but  um   it is like a messer  a knife   being slowly twisted in my brain   their intensity doesn't appear to be weakening   how do you find the ice cap     cold    but does it bring any relief   not so much as i like   well  keep with the cap for now   and give additional pain relief if required   yes  doctor   your headaches will pass as you regain strength  mr  stoll   danke  herr doctor     doctor    mr  lawrence   i was just wondering     when will i regain the feeling in my legs   it's not a democracy  but a hypocrisy   a hypocrisy not a democracy or theocracy or meritocracy because  the lamb  the lamb would never lie down with the    rrrrr   the lamb will never lie down with the lion because the lion will eat       the lion will eat everything      daniel  please  shh   sickness or injury   am i sick or injured  injured or sick  we don't know   cos the powers that be are all powerful   and they know everything  they know who i am and where i am and where you are  sister   where are you  sister  be in my arms  sister   please  please  my son is perfectly harmless   but i can't stop him   onand on like this  day and night  neither of us able to sleep   sleep  perchance to dream  do you know shakespeare  sister   do you know of shakespeare's sister  sister   take him directly to the ward  make a note of his admission when you return     come along    take me to the ward to ward off evil spirits     this way    measure my spirit with a spirit level   level them off  and don't spare the horses   it's because the hearses are waiting   the hearses are waiting for us all     ada  how could you    how could i what   recommend me for private nursing   what    now  what is all this   i am to nurse a clutch of suburban maladies   and what makes you believe i have anything to do with it   i believe you are envious of my professional relationship with dr  culpin  and would like to see us split apart   that is ridiculous   to that end you have indicated to miss luckes that i'm not suited    to work in the receiving room    she told you that   of course not   she told me you gave her exemplary reports of my work     well then      but of course     she would cover for you   ethel     excuse me  sister   ethel  you are obviously upset by this development   but i can assure you miss luckes' decision had nothing to do with me   swear on our friendship   if you insist  i swear   then why would she do this   didn't you ask her   she merely told me it was her right to make use of me as she chooses   perhaps rumour of your closeness to dr  culpin has reached her ear   but not from my lips   now if you'll excuse me     not too tight   what   not too tight   tight enough   don't you think the fact that luckes gave me a wholly inadequate reason  for putting me into private nursing suggests she     wishes to conceal her true motives from me   doing it to separate us seems rather excessive  when she could simply reassign you to any ward in the hospital   scissors  please   what   i was talking to the nurse   does she know about your extra curricular study   the first thing you learn as a probation  luckes knows everything   the odds will always be against you  ethel   studying to be a doctor   do you think i should give up my ambition     do you    never   how's your anatomy coming on   well  i think   have you memorised the facial muscles   where would you like me to begin   well  how about with those responsible for making you smile   risorius   orbicularis oris   zygomaticus major   levator labii superioris     what was that you said   levator labii superioris   sounds painful   nothing can stop you  ethel   nothing  and no one   come in   please may i have a word  sister   of course   the ward is very heavy  nurse   we both have plenty to be getting on with   sister  from our very first days as probations  we are taught the art of observing patients  to glean clinical information from them   yes   mr  stoll is one of mr  dean's patients   is this what you've observed   mr  stoll's current condition  of severe headaches   in degree of severity  is in common with other of mr  dean's patients  who have been operated on under the new anaesthetic  stovaine   in bed four  mr  lawrence has just returned  from an operation under stovaine with no feeling in either leg   i fail to see your point   other patients of mr  dean's  who have been operated under  this concerns you   greatly   if there were any  do you not think mr  dean would already have it under consideration   i have also observed mr  dean on the ward   he behaves almost as if these effects are of scant consequence   do you believe you are in any position  to question a surgeon's clinical judgement  nurse goodley   i'm sorry   i feel it is my responsibility to report to you what i've observed   i feel     stovaine is     well  questionable at least   well     having reported that  i would like you to return to your duties   may i ask         what will you do with what i've said   for the sake of your career        precisely nothing   he asked me to go to the boating lake with him   you can't just do that   why can't i   you can't just go stepping out with him   is it feeling any easier  ma'am   not greatly   massage is generally more effective when applied directly  to the affected area   directly   i fear your clothing and the blanket  may be absorbing some of the benefit  ma'am   the heat from my fingers may have a direct effect on the damaged tissue   are you familiar with the naked leg of a duchess   if you wish  i could avert my eyes during the procedure   very well   leave the room   and i will call you back when i wish for you to continue   yes  ma'am   there's still no feeling in the old pins  i gather     no  doctor    it's a possible  aftereffect of the barker's needle   it creates a temporary hazing of the electrical signals  passing along the tissue which can take a period to clear   how long  doctor  it's been over two days   it varies from patient to patient   thank you  doctor   he's receiving strychnine injections every four hours   yes  doctor   every three  two thirds the current dose   yes  doctor   thank you  gentlemen  and we shall reconvene after luncheon   i thought he might interest you particularly  dr  head   well  after you brought the arm to my attention  i sent the boy to have his nerves tested by the electrical department   the report suggests damage to a large nerve   between his shoulder and neck   i then sent him to be x rayed for its cause   and discovered this wonderfully rare little protuberance here   it rather resembles a rudimentary rib   exactly  sir   known as a cervical rib as it derives from the cervical vertebrae   extremely rare in a child  unknown  in fact   marvellous  isn't it    so it compresses the nerve  blocking the neural pathway   the boy suddenly lost all feeling in his arm  the very moment his development caused the rib  to squeeze all functionality from the nerve   is it treatable   oh yes  amputation   of me arm   of your rib  young fellow   your deliciously spare little rib     gangrene    get mr  dean     how many more  sister    get mr  dean   bring morphine   mr  lawrence  try to keep calm   steady   try to keep calm  keep breathing   dean   i'll be right with you   thank you   i absolutely loathe private nursing   not a good day  i gather   left hand worn out from massaging the naked leg of a very bad tempered duchess   right hand simply suicidal after spending the best part of the evening  soothing a vicar's piles   i'm sure they were both most grateful to you   it's not what i want to do   why is she doing this to me   miss luckes moves in mysterious ways  ethel   it's as if she wants to crush my spirit  i'm wasted out there   and more to the point  i'm needed at the hospital   needed by      the patients   where's laura   had a light supper and went to bed   difficult day   until she's had to endure a lecture on the role of god in science  while staring at an inflamed rectum  she really doesn't know what difficult is     can i help you    miss de burgh   yes   i am nurse ethel bennett from the london hospital   i'm here to prepare a room for your operation   my letter of introduction   you look every bit as you should  my dear   and that is good enough for me  come in out of the cold   thank you     it is so frightfully chilly today    yes   i expect you could do with a hot cup of tea before you get down to work   perhaps even a garibaldi biscuit   i have a packet of peek freans newly opened   what i admire about surgeons  and lord knows there isn't much   is the courage required to commit to that first incision   perhaps for the first few procedures   but courage soon gives way to the reassurance of routine   i imagine it must   of course  under ace my patients aren't awake   scrutinising my every move   you've never considered spinal anaesthesia   i did   but it was like tackling a lamb chop with the lamb looking over your shoulder   i much prefer to rummage around in peace   to which end  gentlemen     to access the cervical vertebrae  we must first negotiate both the anterior and posterior     triangles   correct   comme  a   just one slip and     less than helpful  old chap   sorry   my goodness   for my first three months at the london  i felt as if i did little else but scrub wards   poor child  you must be exhausted   a small room like this is nothing   and that is the table upon which i shall lie while mr  fenwick cuts into me   yes   the same table on which i myself have cut into many a joint of beef down the years   a strange way to look at things  miss de burgh   many delude themselves otherwise   but eventually we are all meat for the worms  my dear   such a gloomy thought   on the contrary   death is surely the spur to a fulfilled life   it reminds us of our human duty  to wring as much meaning from every moment as we can   another garibaldi   thank you   you deserve it   you're late  nurse   sorry  sister  i was   waylaid   i will have to note it in the ward report     yes  sister    well  get on   the top dressings on mr  lawrence's wounds need changing   where   where did they amputate   below or      above the knees   both legs   nurse   the boy's just regaining consciousness from anaesthesia   see to his comfort   yes  sister   nurse   is mr  holland in his office   would you tell him i wish to speak to him as a matter of some urgency   no  not on the telephone   in person   thank you   move back   gentlemen  calm   dr  culpin  dr  ingrams   a gin fight  with bottles  no less   well  neither appears to be bleeding excessively  sister russell   but we can't stitch them up till they calm down   send one to cool off in the padded room  the other to remain in here   give it  what  ten minutes   i can smell their breath from here     twenty then    agreed   take her outside and walk her round the yard until she's calmed down  you     sit down and be quiet   this is a hospital   not an ale house   remind me never to mistake the two in your company   the projection of authority is a trick i picked up from miss luckes   but is it still a trick  sister russell  or is it now you   sister   is there somewhere we can speak   she's dead  isn't she     please      how   she  er  somehow managed to hang herself in her cell last night   when you led her away  there was every indication dr  culpin had saved her life   saved from the caustic soda  but not  it would seem  from the law   had you left her  we would have placed her under  round the clock supervision and care   it wasn't my job to leave her here   and now your job impels you to come and ask  that we give evidence in your favour at her inquest   yes   to help the police by suggesting she was deranged and beyond saving   suicide during temporary insanity   you scratch our back     and the society which drives such women to drink poison  takes no responsibility   the world is harsh and remorseless  sister  you see it  i see it   it drives some people mad   when you find out her history   i wonder if you will still think her mad for cutting it short   history isn't my business     your business is harsh reality    that's right   the harsh reality here  constable   is that you could have saved the life of that poor soul  by leaving her with the people equipped to care for her   i did my duty  doctor   excuse me   i have my work to do   will he give evidence   i think you'll find dr culpin is also a man of duty   now if you'll excuse me     artery forceps   in a moment  i shall need you to get a bowl ready     to receive the breast tissue   is it your habit to complete the sentences of every doctor you assist   or is there something about me that renders the urge irresistible   i'm sorry  mr  fenwick   incidentally   this is by far and away the best prepared domestic room i have ever operated in   thank you   the patient too  has undergone textbook preparation for removal of the breast   receiving bowl   oh  my  how much this dear lady must love life  to endure all this at her age   swabs   my god   we're under enough pressure from the press as it is   if they got hold of this  the outcry would be deafening   assuming it's true  of course   i have yet to speak to the author  but i have every confidence it is   how will you be able to speak to them     they've scrubbed their name out    i erased it to protect them   you know who wrote this   it's because i do i can vouch for their integrity   i had hoped that we'd weathered the anaesthetics storm   spinal anaesthesia is in its infancy  sydney   stovaine is a new drug   new methods can often bring new problems  and they take time to manifest themselves   but henry dean is one of the most eminent surgeons in london   he's been at the vanguard of spinal anaesthesia since it came from france   he lectures on the subject  for pity's sake   that may make him reluctant to find stovaine  responsible for the complications it's alleged to cause   key word here  alleged   would you ask mr  morris to come to my office immediately   thank you   what do you intend to do   if this is true   everything in my power to prevent it becoming a major scandal   mr  lawrence  your wife is here   mr  lawrence   your wife   hello  love   i'm    i'm still alive  mary   i'm still alive   good morning  gentlemen   gentlemen   you are all familiar with the contents of the letter  received by miss luckes earlier this morning   please sit   the letter lists case after case of alleged complication  following surgery carried out under the anaesthetic stovaine  administered by injection into the spinal cord   in response  i have set mr  morris the task  of cross referencing the records  to ascertain whether there is now a genuine cause for concern  about the use of stovaine here at the london  ernest   the last confirmed death following an operation under stovaine  was of a raphael patient operated on by mr lette two weeks ago for umbilical hernia   after swift examination of the ward reports   i have taken the view that the list of unsatisfactory results  following the use of stovaine does indeed stand scrutiny   well  gentlemen  i've heard sufficient to  move that we immediately ask our medical council  to advise us at the earliest opportunity  on whether stovaine should in fact be used in this hospital   all in favour   i further move that  until that decision is received   we ask our surgeons to abstain from the use of this drug   the surgeons won't like it   the surgeons are not my prime concern  the reputation of this hospital is   all in favour   you see how i'm buttering the bread   yes  nurse   evenly  without meanness or extravagance   the bread bin is cleaned and emptied every day and kept well covered   any bread that isn't eaten   we cover and use at the next meal  what is it   don't let me interrupt your work  ladies   i've unchained myself from paperwork for a few minutes to do some rounds   you look tired  nurse goodley   i trust you're getting enough sleep   yes  matron   it's easy to allow things we encounter on the ward to develop a grip on us  and leave us feeling only we are thus affected   but more often than not  others have the same concerns   sharing the load  that's the key   thank you  matron   carry on     patients in      is it true   might we continue this conversation at another time   most kind   editor of the times in search of another wrong tree to bark up   is it true the house committee has taken it upon itself to suspend the use of stovaine   my dear mr  dean         in light of recent concerns   the committee has asked for a medical council directive on the  use of stovaine and simply asks surgeons  to refrain from its use until     in other words  a moratorium   moratorium  such a long word  don't you think   the remit of the house committee  extends to questions of hospital policy  not medicine   might one not  under certain circumstances   expect the one to affect the other   nevertheless  and with all due respect   a lay committee is not qualified to deliberate on medical matters   does one need to be a doctor to identify an untimely corpse   actually  yes   might i ask from which quarter this sudden concern over stovaine emanates   mr  morris has been monitoring deaths from anaesthesia  since the rate spiralled from 155  four years ago to over 230 last year   only there is talk of an anonymous letter   well  even if that were the case  the anonymity of its author  wouldn't render the letter's contents any the less serious if found to be true     i shall protest  mr  holland    as is your prerogative   as will every doctor in the house     expect a fight    i always do  mr  dean   i always do   i  um     i thought perhaps if mohammed couldn't come to the mountain  that  er     the mountain might     and you are the mountain in what sense   of medical knowledge   as much as i would like to let you in  i'm afraid it would be inappropriate   are you sure  i am a doctor and  er         i have cakes   and i have an anatomy text book  and garibaldi biscuits   i miss you in the receiving room   i missed it terribly at first   and now   i've come to appreciate how far i have succumbed to my own liking of excitement  over the patients' needs   luckes   luckes     sure i can't tempt you    not with the cakes   good night  millais   chloroform and ether is first directed upon the higher nervous centres   especially those associated with consciousness   and then  step by step  it affects the centres for maintaining life itself     stovaine avoids these dangers    during the operation  perhaps     but post operative complications      technicalities that time will resolve   would you tell mr  lawrence in raphael  that the loss of his legs is a technicality   advances are rarely without cost  mr  holland   a moratorium on stovaine is a moratorium on progress itself   oh  come on   i have seen what stovaine can accomplish   at fribourg  a thousand operations with stovaine  have been performed at the women's hospital  without a single death or serious complication   at university college hospital   barker has performed 400 operations using stovaine   the first 300 went well  just two deaths in the last 100     two too many    of course  of course   no one is claiming that stovaine is suitable for all operations   but for those it is  it brings great benefits   the benefits aren't in question  the risks are   and they should be worked at  and eliminated  but how will that be possible  if we simply abandon stovaine and spinal anaesthesia  without giving them a chance to establish themselves   no  i stand with dean   mr  lawrence  raphael ward   i have performed too many autopsies on patients who expired  after alcohol and ether sent them so deeply into unconsciousness  they could not be recovered   we must move forward and  for this reason  i  too  stand with dean     me too    mr  fenwick   as chairman of the medical council  where do you stand on stovaine   the evidence on stovaine is contradictory   when it works without complication  it is unsurpassed   but the incidence of complication is significantly frequent   in an attempt to broaden my understanding   i made enquiries at other london hospitals  regarding the wider use of this drug   your future rests on how you answer the following question   did you or did you not surreptitiously report your personal concerns  regarding stovaine anaesthetic   at the middlesex  st thomas'  guy's  stovaine is hardly ever used     as is anything      indeed  it is looked upon with grave suspicion   as is anything new by those interested in maintaining the status quo   nevertheless  i have acquired a list of recorded sequelae  following the use of stovaine from just one doctor at the middlesex   three cases of acute mania  acase of epileptiform attacks     five cases of incontinence of faeces      is this all you have  fenwick  a list   one case of paralysis of the lower limbs   lasting until death several months later   this doctor concludes that   the number of recorded cases of escape from imminent death is so great   as to inspire a profound distrust of the anaesthetic employment   of stovaine    if you lie to me  nurse goodley   i will see to it that your nursing career is over   not merely at the london   i will ensure you never wear the cap again   i sense you're considering a degree of obfuscation   i warn you again  do not   i have made a speciality of rooting out deceit   it appears as a quality in the eyes that a liar cannot conceal   however hard they try     your own view  hurry    i am against its use     you stand against your own profession    i am unconvinced by the arguments   or are you more convinced that by aligning yourself with the lay establishment    it may better feather the autumn of your career    mr  dean   if i were ten years younger  i would invite you outside for that remark   if you were ten years younger  mr  fenwick   too  would realise that stovaine is the future   all those in favour of stovaine  say aye   aye   we've had the fight  mr  holland  now you've witnessed its outcome   progress or stagnation  what say you   nurse goodley   did you or did you not sneak behind mr  dean's back  to report your concerns about stovaine   look at me  nurse  and answer my question   miss luckes  would you leave us  please  sister   i was just speaking to nurse goodley   and now i wish to speak to her    in private     in private    now  please  sister   as you wish   matron   well  your letter has caused something of a stir   the surgeons and the house committee  are doing battle over the use of stovaine as we speak   you've been brave  now you must be sensible in equal measure   be assured mr  dean will seek out whoever wrote that letter   he will claim he cannot operate in an atmosphere where his clinical judgment  is questioned and mistrusted   he will sniff out and hound the author from the ward   then from the nursing profession itself     but there's proof      he will destroy you  nurse goodley   and there will be nothing i can do to prevent it   which is why i am offering you a place in my office         under my personal protection   now  mr  dean is due a leave of absence   we should be certain that you are not here on his return   i    i don't know what to say   well  i'm afraid you have little choice but to say yes   and to say it now    reporting on the value of the new anaesthetic  stovaine    the house committee of the london hospital states   that enquiries into its use show that its introduction is a benefit to humanity      the committee believes       no   to believe in something is to suggest an element of faith   which in itself  raises a question mark over the certainty surrounding the thing   no equivocation  the committee states  state it without doubt    the committee states that the great advantage of stovaine   is that the shock to the patient is far less   than the shock from ether or chloroform      it has been decided        not  decided    agreed    you shall have your way  mr  dean   but not at the cost of seeing this committee's authority publicly diluted   very well   mr  morris    it has been decided   that the use of stovaine shall continue at the london hospital    hello  joe hello   how's your arm   excellent     nurse goodley    mr  dean   now  you must do everything the doctors tell you  joe   they know best   the use of stovaine was refined and continued until the 1970's  suicide was illegal until 1961  is it going to be like this every single day     what's your name    saul   i have only heard terrible things about you   one day soon  there'll be tremendous change   you only have to open your eyes to open your mind   i think one more extra duty and i'd leave the london on the spot   no wonder you're exhausted   and there's this massive swell of poverty and depravation  and it's allowed to just blow in at the feet of one nursing sister  it's not right   they didn't blind us and cut out our tongues when we finished training  did they   laura   has something affected you
