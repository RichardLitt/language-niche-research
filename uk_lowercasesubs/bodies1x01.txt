oxymoron   no  a tautology  senior senior house officer   i tried bleeping your sho but i got no response   we don't have an sho   she's supposed to be arriving from spain  but she can't get registered unless she's got a job  and the hospital won't give her a job unless she's registered   so  what are you doing  tom   tim  i'm clocking her in   this is winifred bourne   spare me  she's hurley's    well  we are on take today   yes  i know we're on take  polly   but look at her  she's deader than elvis  i'm not having her peg it under me   not literally under me  obviously    roger

you   how are you getting on with roger    fine  thanks   good   good    polly   really sorry about this  mr hurley    that's okay   her chest film shows pulmonary secondaries   possible pneumonia  though it's hard to tell   couldn't fetch me a glass of water  could you    water   please    okay   thanks   winifred   i'm mr hurley  do you remember me   very good  we're going to make you as comfortable as possible  okay  thank you   i'm just going to take your mask off   it's okay  it's okay   there you go   very good  well done   just going to put your mask back on   there you go  okay   thanks   the daughter's complaining  they've already been here eight hours    when did i operate on her   october the first  bad luck   what's the problem   post operative mortality  if she lives for 30 days  she wouldn't appear in the figures    tim  is it tim   yes   could you check if there's a hospice bed available  please    of course  my pleasure   thank you    doctor  i'm mrs bourne's daughter   yes   yes  of course   i'll take it  polly  thanks   polly  could you do this one with me  lost condom   um     can you     he never told me it'd come off till we was finished    he was  you know  fishing around for it for ages   and couldn't your boyfriend find it   me boyfriend finding it was what we was worried about   if you will insist on having casual sex   then the least thing you can do is ensure that the condom is fitted securely   you're at risk from unwanted pregnancy      tell me what you can see      all kinds of diseases   i'm not sure   okay  let me have a look   oh   well  at least your tie is not still a virgin  eh    she's pissed herself   is that so   you don't expect me to change the bed  do you   i wouldn't stop you   donna   offering to play debbie mcgee to my paul daniels    i'm sorry to bother you  mr hurley  but     mr hurley  uh oh  what have i done   i don't think it's appropriate for mrs bourne to be on the ward   it's just till she can be transferred to the hospice    which hospice   i don't know  newlands   there's 60 patients in this hospital  that the bed manager thinks there's a place at newlands  newlands isn't built yet   i thought i could get her in somewhere tonight   there wasn't time to sort it out  she'll move out in the morning   as i said  roger  i don't think it's appropriate that she's in an acute gynae bed   donna  you were the one that wanted me to help her in the first place   i don't think it's fair to share in the credit when things go right  and to blame me when things go wrong   boost the driver    i have done   well  boost it again   ovarian salvage is the cornerstone of my work   i believe some unilocular ovarian cysts can be managed expectantly   this strategy is appropriate for women with a cyst size of less than five centimetres   cysts eight centimetres or less have a very low risk of malignancy  and often resolve spontaneously   this is the fundamental objective of my work   to give the woman her best chance of a normal reproductive life   thank you   thank you very much   boss  i need to talk to you about this ca cervix woman   what's there to talk about  get her through the night    evening  hugh   good   can you just give me a minute  rob    if you need me to come down  i'll come down   no  no  it's fine    you sure   yeah   sorry about that  how are you   she's already had 24 hours of demerol   give her some more   not me   give her some more   or i will   she shouldn't even have been here   no  she shouldn't   she wasn't even that old   well  she's dead now  don't get much older than that    how is she   sorted   rob  i'm sorry   these lectures  they don't come up very often   thanks for covering    hiya   hi   maybe roger shouldn't have operated on her   maybe he should have referred her for radiotherapy   why do you say that   no reason   i don't worry anymore about how much these things affect me   i worry about how little they do   come on  i'll buy you a drink   i've gotta give a report    afterwards  then   afterwards  i go home   this month i had one instance of post operative mortality   patient was 67 years old with n stage ca cervix   pulmonary mets and pneumonia  she was awaiting transfer to hospice  but unfortunately died on the ward before a place could be found   i carried out palliative excision and repair on her  radiotherapy was an alternative  but it would have made her extremely ill   the palliative surgery gave her the best chance of a reasonable quality of life  and the mri scan indicated she was operable   thank you   death is a death  though  when it's in black and white   it's easy to have impressive figures when you turn away anyone who's really sick   someone told me something once  i think it was an old boss of mine   the superior surgeon uses his superior judgement to stay clear of any situation  which might test his superior ability    thought they were going to fix this   well  they haven't so far    thanks for everything   oh  you're welcome   thank you   here  good    who was that   fuck knows  good chocs  though   is it mustard flavour  i'm into mustard this week   the anti christ wants mustard    too strong   what   too strong   i tingle   angela strawberry    that's an unusual name  very pretty   thank you   oh  sorry  i've got a bit of a sore throat   well  i'm polly grey  i'm specialist registrar in obstetrics and gynaecology  and i was wondering if i could ask you some questions about your sex life    well  i don't see why not   okay   right   are you in a sexual relationship   honestly  it's medical   so  we spoke about laparoscopy in outpatients   i'm going to make a small incision in the abdomen   take a look inside with a tiny little telescope   all i need is your consent    i've been doing some research on the internet   oh  jesus   i'd like to ask again about the risks   laparoscopy isn't a high risk operation   of course  no medical procedure is without its dangers   thousands of people have operations in the nhs everyday   only a small number of them have any problems   that's the most important thing to remember    you're patronising me   of course i am  i'm a doctor   but i'm also telling you the truth   worse case scenario  what can go wrong   like i say  there's no worse case scenario commonly associated with this medical procedure   there are always worse case scenarios   i insist on knowing  or i'll withhold consent   you could suffer a reaction to the anaesthetic   which would leave you either dead or permanently disabled   you could haemorrhage during the operation and bleed to death   the operation could be a complete success   but you get a clot forming in your leg which would shoot up to the lungs  and then  bang  fatal cardiac arrest   when did your last orgasm result from sexual intercourse or masturbation    it's rob lake  you're bleeping me   hi  rob  it's maya   look  i know this sounds like rubbish   but i've got a patient here with a really bad sore throat   i was thinking it could be acute epiglottitis   we're ready for you   she needs an ent opinion  look  i've got to go into a case   but if you've got any problems  give me a call  okay   all right  no problem   keep calm  it's all right   okay  angela  can you keep still for me  i just need to listen to your chest   it's okay  it's all right   shit  donna  get me an adrenaline neb and 200 cortisone iv    okay   did you speak to anyone at ent    i thought you were gonna do it   what   you said she needed an ent opinion   they'll only see gynae patients if the registrar or above make the referral   i assumed you'd call them    that's not what i meant at all   that's what it sounded like  what do we do   get the crash trolley   hi  i need the bleep number for the registrar on call for ent  please   thank you   calm down  you'll be fine   o g  mr lake  she's busy   listen  mate  i need this line for an urgent medical call   o g  mr lake

 i will when i'm ready  thank you   okay  okay   okay  i'm in the trachea   keep still  ange    oxygen's in   the oxygen's going in now  angela   angela  the oxygen's gonna help you  but you've got to help me by keeping still  please   keep still  ah  shit   okay  she's going to need a surgical cric   get back onto ent  call around  see if anybody's done a cric before    call mr hurley   she needs it now  rob   this isn't my fucking section  donna  i've never even seen a cric   she needs a stable cric   you're the closest thing to a surgeon we've got right now    still got an output   put out a 222 respiratory arrest   just do it     any news    not yet   hold her down  hold her here  hold her rock fucking steady     trying    try fucking harder   oh  she's bleeding into her trachea  oh

 everyone   okay   sit down   look  ent had an emergency of their own  if they hadn't  they would've been here   but even then  there's no guarantee she would have survived   i had a chance to do a cric and i botched it   look     we're not machines  rob  we can all have an off day   you made an isolated  uncharacteristic error   i panicked and i let everything get on top of me  i shouldn't have   you're not expected to be able to perform a surgical cricothyrotomy   the only mistake you made was taking it on   some doctors don't take on the difficult cases because they're afraid of failing   and that's not how we do things on my firm   we're not obsessed with buffing our figures  we do what's best for the patient   and if you hadn't have acted  that woman would have died   she did die   rob  i consider this a tragic accident  an accident's where no one's to blame   you're not to blame    you all right   yeah   good   harder    if you'd just like to take a seat in here   thank you   i'll tell him you're here   yeah  hello  anne marie  it's donna  would you let mr hurley know  that mrs strawberry's daughter and son are in the gynae ward office   yeah  okay  thanks   mr hurley's secretary says he's already on his way up  okay   good morning  i was one of the doctors dealing with your mother   she developed a condition called acute epiglottitis  which causes the throat to close off   and we have to make a hole in the throat to enable her to breathe again   for a specialist in throat surgery  this is a relatively simple procedure   however  it's not something we really do on this ward   hysterectomies and caesarean sections are our thing   a specialist was required at a very short amount of time and     morning  rob   hi  i'm roger hurley  i'm the consultant  i'm sorry for your loss   rob  could you do me a favour and start the ward round  i'll catch up with you   thank you   your mother was under my care following her hysterectomy   surgery puts an enormous strain on the body  i think she was susceptible to infection   and what started out as no more than a simple sore throat  turned very quickly and very alarmingly into a life threatening condition   the doctors here only had what amounted to a minute or less  to carry out a very difficult procedure   they did everything they could  but there wasn't sufficient time   we're all very sorry    a tracheotomy  was that the procedure   something similar  yeah   i've seen it done on television  they make a cut and bingo   well  that's television   i'm really very sorry for your loss  if there's anything i can do     thank you   look  i hate to do this but i have a ward round to do now   bye bye   come on  they're fine     labour ward    rob lake     breathe    here is the registrar for you  hazel    thanks  doctor   is everything okay   late decelerations  big dips   big dips  okay  the trace suggests the baby might be in some kind of distress    i'm going to have to do an internal examination   i just did one  she's fully dilated   please don't take this the wrong way  hazel  i just want to check for myself   i'm sorry    okay  she's fully dilated and ot   do want to do an instrumental delivery   we're talking about helping the baby out with forceps   let's get her down to theatre  if the forceps don't work  then we move on to a caesarean    okay   okay  good    hiya  dottie   hi  maria    i thought we were doing a cs   we are   so  where is the patient   fuck this     hazel  where's my      you're doing really well  really well   thought we'd give her a few more minutes  don't mind  do you  rob   just going to take a blood sample  just going to make a tiny little nick in the baby's scalp  okay   thank you   big push now  here we go again  big push  good girl  good girl    big push  good girl   still got big dips  eh  boss    i know  let's wait for the foetal ph  eh   i had theatre all prepped   i know   breathe   ph seven point one   seven point one  okay  we're going to have to get your baby out straightaway  okay   take her through  please     frontal pressure    are you okay    this baby's as flat as a pancake   let's just cut the cord  shall we   now      maybe we shouldn't have waited  boss   just concentrate on this  rob   go   just going to give you an injection   suction   suction   contractor  please   there he goes   well done  all's well that ends well   okay   you've been roger's registrar for    how long is it now   surely you must have cause for concern   he's just delivered a healthy baby from a healthy mum   rob   rob  he was appointed based on his research in ovarian disease   that and the funding that he brings to the hospital   he isn't experienced enough in general obstetric practice  to hold the post of consultant in o g   you ever made a mistake  ever killed someone   i've been a doctor for 1 3 years  of course i have   well then  with all due respect  who are you to point the finger   rob  i'm not being insensitive to the cricothyrotomy   every doctor makes mistakes   but everybody in this hospital knows that roger makes mistakes again and again and again   now  that is not an isolated  uncharacteristic error   you know  if there's a willingness to accept that or to learn from it or talk     you're wrong about him   he's a supportive boss  he's hard working  he's a good guy   roger hurley may be a good guy  he's just not that good a doctor    yvonne     what    you're going to be okay   shit   kat   oh  god   bloody hell   hey  what's the difference between a midwife and a sperm   i don't know   the sperm can find the cervix   two centimetres dilated  you've a long way to go  my girl  a long  long way   mrs carr should have her blood pressure checked hourly overnight   okay  i'll make sure the night staff know   that's about me done for the day    you   another hour or so maybe    long day   long day   i could wait around an hour if you fancied going out for a quick drink    sorry   another night  then   the next time i won't try talking to you on the ward    i do need to talk to you  though   rob   do you think roger hurley's incompetent   he's very into his research  he's genuinely caring about his patients   have you ever seen him make mistakes   the maternity unit sees 4 000 labours a year  some are bound to go wrong   do his go wrong more often than they should   some people say they do    who are some people   hospital people   what do you say   i've been here long enough to know it's best never to say anything   wait a second   who are these people who slag him off anyway  midwives  nurses  fucking porters   you asked me what people say  i told you   what do they say about me now  i botched up a cric and killed someone   complete waste of space    what do you say about me   i don't say anything about you  rob   i'm sorry about angela strawberry   i'm sorry it happened on your ward   please  don't say it wasn't my fault   i just need someone to acknowledge i could've done better   you could've done better   if not tonight  can i see you tomorrow night    i'm married   i know   what happened shouldn't have happened  i'm sorry   i'm not   see
