i have to remind myself there was more to my son's life than     than being murdered in a bar brawl   it tends to dominate  it shouldn't  it mustn't   i find it extraordinary  that in a room filled with more than 100 people no one saw a thing   the murder weapon   the knife   disappeared   and the security cameras were conveniently blind for the evening   but i see it   i need to know what really happened  it's as simple as that     and the police investigation is ongoing    they say   they have a suspect whom they've arrested twice  but there's never been a charge     who's the suspect    let me show you   his name is o'connor   james o'connor   he was at niversity with lan   his father owns the bar where it happened     the z bar    terry o'connor     you know him    yeah  he's a big time villain   hence the missing evidence     and forgetful witnesses   why would lan want to get mixed up with the o'connors   he was interested in owning his own bar restaurant   do you have to ask these people for permission   yes  you do   who's the investigating officer   his name's driscoll  dci driscoll     is that good or bad    it's good   no  it's fine  it's good  it's good   lan's friends   the friends that were there   what do they know   they know nothing  saw nothing     yo don't believe them    i think they're frightened     of o'connor    it wold seem so  yes   no disrespects  mr harper   but if lan's friends don't want to talk to the police or you   what makes you think they'll want to talk to me   because the police want them on the witness stand   i reek of grief  and what they say to you will go no further   i'm not asking you to do the job of the police   i'm asking you to find out why my son was murdered   do you have children     no  i don't  no    do you   yeah   then you'll know how i feel   this is something we should talk about   i want yo to nderstand  if we do take the case   we'll be looking into lan's life and lifestyle   are you prepared for that   yes  of course   then i shall give you a call tomorrow with an answer   yes  thank you for coming to see me   no  thank you   what's there to think about   he just wants someone to hold his hand and tell him that his boy is lovely and special     no  he wants to know what happened    he knows  it happens every saturday night     want a coffee    i hope you're not thinking of turning him down   i want to do this  vincent   it'll make a change from insurance frauds and matrimonials   and he's got nowhere else to go except to us     we can help heal the pain  can we    no  no   we can tell him what happened and why  hopefully  given the chance   i'll think about it  it's a good case    in every sense of the word   what are you doing tonight     i'm supposed to go to my sister's for a meal    not fancy it   it's like a dating agency and i'm the only client   lynn seems to think the best way for me to forget about cathy  is to go with someone else     you don't    it's not fair on someone else  is it   you told harper you had a kid   yeah  kyle  he's seven     i didn't know    yeah   he lives with his dad in the states   thanks to the american family courts  i see him twice a year   a very long  sad story   it must be tough   god bless america     do you want this biscuit    what   i've got a sweet tooth   vincent     i'm thinking about it   how are you

dad around   not yet  he's on his way  though     where have you been    don't you start   vincent   can yo hear me  is this thing working   yeah  we can hear you   i shouldn't be more than a couple of minutes   no  vincent    james     yes  i'm here    your old man's here   james  he's coming in now  he's coming to you  what do you want to do   there's a fire exit at the back  i'll see you there   j   what's in the bag   i asked you a question   what's in the bag   videotapes   the tapes of me in the z bar   in one of them  i go to the toilet   have a piss  wash my hands   then some bloke i know decides to fly at me with a knife   we fight   and then the knife's on the floor  so i grab it   to stop him from grabbing it   and then he flies at me again   and i try to stop him   but i don't   i kill him   i mrder him   that's how the world sees me  dad   i don't like it   i can't handle it   i have to change it     i have to go    j  behave yourself for crying out loud   look at yourself  look at yourself  eh   think about it   do you want to go to prison  do you   j  j   i will not lose you   i won't  i will do whatever is necessary to keep you safe   even if that means locking you up myself  i will not lose you   understand   i love you  son   i love you too much to lose you   trst me   will yo do that   james  tell your dad i've got the knife   tell him i've got the knife and i'm outside   vincent gallagher says to tell you he's got the knife   he's outside waiting for me     where is it    it's in a safe place     what do you want    i want three things   first  i want you to leave me and mine alone   second  i want to see the video on behalf of my client   and third  i want you to let james make his own decision   if he's his father's son  so be it   but he's got to make his own choice   he'll choose the courtroom  no   look  terry   it seems to me this was self defence   once they see what kind of boy your son is       know him well  do you    i know he's not you   just give it   why did lan harper attack james     in your club  in your bar   in front of your cameras   that wasn't clever   i know he was off his nut   but he was having a go at you  terry   he was having a go at you     you think    james told me that you humiliated lan   you laughed at him and whispered something in his ear   what did you say  terry  it must have been good  cos half an hour later he came back and tried to stab james   the only reason i'm talking to you is because my boy's watching   give me the knife  or you and yours will be looking over your shoulder   it shouldn't be too difficult to find you     john  where is it    oh  it's safe   you've got two days before i go to the police   i want to see that video   and i want to know what you whispered   hello  vincent   i knew you'd be nervous   so i thoght i'd wait in for yo   i brought the tapes   from all the cameras  do you want to look at them   see   lan harper's got the knife   it was self defence   obviously james was defending himself  he was fighting back   but it was lan harper who attacked him   why would he want to do that   cos he's a shit   i heard abot him from j  and i didn't like the sond of him   rich boy  big ideas   he broght him to the clb and i agreed to see him  to hear him ot   i've got ideas  enthusiasm   straightaway he was in my face with his schemes   maybe something like the lion club only bigger   i cold see he was ot of his head  nose  tonge  dripping with coke   so i challenged him   have you brought drugs onto the premises   mr o'connor  i'm sorry   he was fll of apologies  pathetic   so i thoght i'd see what he was really made of   what's you girlfriend's name   i had no idea then nicola and j were lovers     nicola    she'll do   what do you mean   do i have to be crude and spell it out to you   you arrange nicola for me and we can start again   sorry   arrange  nicola   she can be nconscios if yo like   ok   yeah  i'll arrange it     you really are a piece of filth  aren't you    what   i can't talk to filth like that  i certainly can't do bsiness with it   don't   i told j what kind of friend he really was   i thoght that'd be the end of it   but no   he took it out on j   and i nearly lost him   now he's begging me to let him go to the police  to the corts   let him do it  let him go to the police   but then i'll lose control   he's my son  he's not going to get justice   i do not want to lose him  vince   it's already happening  though  isn't it  terry   how come he's listening to me before he's listening to his dad   he's everything you wanted him to be   he's not a villain like his dad  is he   you done a good job  you should be proud of him   let him go to the police   who do i ask for at the farm   driscoll  dci driscoll   he's top piggy   edward harper   yeah   he needs to know what happened   what am i gonna tell a man whose son died  becase he was a horrible little bastard who was ot of his depth  eh   he'll think i'm talking about a complete stranger   what did you tell him   vincent   fancy a coffee     i'll get the coffee    yeah   what did you tell him   and a cake  a nice bit of cake   i told him the truth  that's what he paid us for   i told him not to worry about what's said and who's saying it   i told him that he knew his boy best   better than anyone   you're right   that's what i wanted to tell him
