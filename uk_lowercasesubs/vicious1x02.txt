 oh  i'm so glad you enjoyed your cruise  mother   yes  you told me all about the islanders   please stop calling them that   because we don't use that word any more   i'd love to come and see you  but i've got a cold   atchoo  see   yea    actually  i should lie down   really  i must be going  i'm very ill   i'm hanging up  dear  stop talking   good lord  was that your mother   don't tell me she managed to make it back alive again   next time  you should send her somewhere really exotic   smother her with a pillow   how dare you talk about her like that   oh  please  all that money and the nicest present she ever gave us  was breaking her leg last christmas   well  i never spoke poorly of your mother   well  that's because my mother had the decency  to know the appropriate time to die   a characteristic you both don't share  unfortunately   although the way you look this morning   i'll be surprised if you make it to teatime  ooh  bugger   i've got to look my best   i've got this fan club screening of my doctor who episode  this week   what can i do to look younger   not go   you'd like that  wouldn't you   you've always been jealous of my success   it is sad   i feel sad for you   you're a poor  sad  invisible  little man   i think one of your teeth just fell out   i'll get it   any time i'm walking away from you   i can feel the blood start returning to my veins   hello  ash   it's ash   our new neighbour  i hope it's not too early   of course not  freddie  don't stand so close to the boy   his breath is nothing to be alarmed about  ash   it's just his insides decaying   would you like a cup of tea   that'd be great  thanks  ah   i've got a bit of a problem  ah   and    i don't have anyone else to talk to  mm   you remember that girl from back home i told you i was seeing   tracey  eurgh  her   stupid name   yes  of course we remember  how can we help   she says she doesn't want to see me any more   but i really like her and i don't know what to do   she sounds like a complete idiot   good riddance  i say   i never seem to know what girls want   women just want somebody to make them feel special   a little kindness goes a long way   oh  for christ's sake  violet   why don't you ever call first   er  ash  you remember our friend  violet   hi  so nice to see you again  ash   does it make you uncomfortable if i tell you  the musculature of your chest reminds me of a cousin from my youth   i it makes me feel very uncomfortable   i love how playful you are   ash was just telling us about this drug addicted slag who's broken his heart   she's actually a nurse   well  maybe you should try dating someone a bit older   violet  stop turning your head to flirt   your neck keeps cracking   ash was asking for advice about women   then  why did he come here   we don't like those kinds of jokes   look  ash  if this is a girl that you like   you should just tell her how you feel   does that really work  of course   you need to be direct  women are less forthcoming than men   is that cotton   why are you here  violet   oh  i suppose i thought we could all spend the day together   we can't  we're shopping today   freddie needs a new coat for his doctor who screening  ooh   apparently  i have been voted the tenth most popular villain of all time   does something like that even mean anything   er  i dunno   of course it means something   and i don't need a new coat  the one i've got is perfectly fine   it's not perfectly fine  you've had it for ages   all right  stop spitting   so which villain did you play   i don't want to talk about it any more  everybody go home   why is it all so bright and garish   it's like walking into elton john's dressing room   i don't like it here  let's go   nonsense  we're getting you a new coat   well  why do i need a new coat  i just got this  last year   you did not get that last year   well  recently   look  here's a ticket stub for     lawrence of arabia   mm  all right  let's go  no  we're not leaving  oh     well  maybe it was a little longer than i remembered   ah  now  what about this one   oh  i like that  oh  that would be perfect for the screening   everybody who's anybody's going to be there   who exactly  doctor who   oh  god  has your memory gone now  too   oh  look  that can't be right   excuse me  excuse me   arsehole   they make me nervous   all these young people skittering about like mice   desperate to get back onto the internet   let's just pay for it and go  no   actually  i think we can probably find something better elsewhere   no  let's go  oh   actually  that works   you know  when we filmed that doctor who episode   i never dreamt it would become  one of the most iconic roles of my career   or only   well  i think it's quite exciting  freddie   thank you  penelope   now  is this a television programme we're talking about  or a book   it's a television programme  ah   what's the matter with you  how could it be a book   i'm sorry  i'm only half paying attention   but i got a lot right before this   you're doing fine  darling   freddie's the actor  right  or is it the other one   stuart   my name is stuart and we've known each other for 50 years   of course i know your name s    stuart   you're all invited to the screening  ooh   except you   it's going to be quite the evening   will there be a lot of single men   it's a science fiction fan club event   they'll be single  but they'll be disgusting   i have broad tastes  i am over 40   oh  are you  because i thought you were still 39   ooh   it is rather stressful  coming here   oh  ash  come in   ah  you remember our friend violet   and penelope  of course  hi   stuart  don't just stand there like a lump  get ash a drink   i haven't been offered a drink   then get up and get one   i'll get you a drink  penelope   thank you  s    stuart   so  what is it we can do for you  ash   more problems with the ladies  i'm afraid so   they are a lot of work   men  on the other hand  are simpler   take stuart and me  it's just fun  fun  fun  all the time   isn't that right  stuart  yes   it's like living in disneyland   well  i'm not a lot of work  ash   do you understand what i'm saying   i hope not   i just wish i knew how to win tracey back   didn't you tell her how you felt   yes  but she still doesn't want to see me any more   what about a gift  penelope and i could take you shopping   that's a great idea  stuart  what about some lunch   no  i can't  i've    got an appointment   i'll be gone all day  best of luck  ash   where the hell are you going  i told you  i have an appointment   if you die before i come home  i'll say goodbye now   are all these girls prostitutes   no  that's just how they dress  oh   everyone's very proud of their vaginas now   in our day  you never discussed such things   i've never even seen mine   why are we looking for a gift for tracey in the men's department   i thought i might get you a little something first   perhaps a t shirt  or swimming trunks     oh  i don't know   well  we won't know until you start trying them on  will we   i like this one   i'm not sure  just try it on   oh  violet  look  what is it   isn't that    that    stuart    i was getting there   what's he doing  talking to that man  i've no idea   looks like he's flirting   we'd better go  i don't want him to see us   and with such a younger man  too   where's his self respect   it's way too small  oh   well  let's just get a quick photo  so we can be certain   oh  i just checked on the dog  he's looking really splendid for 20   i think i saw his tail move   he's having a good day  yes   where are you going  all tarted up   i told you  i'm going to see my mother   tell her i said hello   and to walk toward the light   i don't know why you have such a problem with my mother   she's always been kind to you  she sends you birthday cards   one card on my 30th birthday and she signed it   'i think it's time you found a wife '  still  it was thoughtful   now  make sure you take balthazar outside  and hold him up while he does his business   then you can put him back to bed   oh  and remember to flip him over onto the side that still has fur   all right  i'll remember   oh  god  what was i supposed to do   hello   oh  hello  mrs bixby   no  this isn't stuart  this is freddie   yes  the actor   yes  i'm still living here   because i'm not looking for a wife   anyway  stuart should be there shortly   no   isn't he coming to see you   i see  oh  i must be mistaken  would you excuse me   splendid  catching up  dear   horrible  old cow   oh  vi  thank god you're there  it's freddie   you must come over right away   oh  hang on  there's somebody at the door   are you always out there  i was just popping round   what's wrong  it's stuart   i think he's having an affair   are you certain  he's been sneaking around for days   and now he's lied about where he's going  oh  my   there's just one thing that doesn't make any sense  what's that   who the hell would want to shag stuart   i don't understand  how could stuart be seeing another man   i've been nothing but loving for 48 years   you might be getting upset over nothing   anyway  i should go   you just got here  yes  but i was looking for stuart   erm  well  he's not here  so     you're acting very strangely  vi   you don't know something  do you   of course not  i saw nothing   oh  hi  i was just coming by to let you know that i got back together with tracey   she loved the gift  i owe you one  i'll try and remember   oh  that's wonderful  ash   is everything ok   i'm going through a bit of a personal crisis   it's nothing i want to talk about   i guess i should also     are you sure you're all right  you see right through me  ash   it's stuart  i'm afraid he's seeing somebody else  i don't believe that   oh  ash  you're so young  so naive   you've no idea what men are like   well  i am a man  so i probably have a bit of an idea   mm   i'm going to have to consider very carefully how i'm going to handle this   you could just talk to him   i could   or i could emotionally torture him when he gets home  and then follow him next time he leaves the house   yes  i think that's the winner   would you like a biccie   oh  still alive   ooh  good dog   right  you can go back to sleep  now   oh  morning   i didn't hear you come in  last night  oh   how is your mother   oh  fine  she sends her regards   does she  yes   she got some lovely colour on her cruise   is she a darker shade of grey now   well  i must be going   actually  i've got a doctor's appointment   do you  yes  what's wrong with you   aside from that visual horror show your body has become     i'm just having them check  that my stomach is still strong enough to stand the sight of you   i'll be back in time to make it to your screening   i'm surprised you even remembered   considering how many engagements you've had lately   i'm suddenly living with peaches geldof   do you even know who that is   no   now  if you want  i'll paint your face on when i come home   so you'll at least resemble what you used to look like   he's just left   i feel kind of weird about this  freddie   ash  we helped you get back together with that drug addict  didn't we   she's a nurse  so you keep saying  now hurry  before we lose him   wait  wait  wait  wait   i've just got to poke the dog   oh  he's still alive   good boy   all right  let's go   i see you're back again with your whore   violet  what are you doing here  i followed you   you followed me  yes  i'm here to warn you   freddie knows you're having an affair   how could you  they've been together 48 years   it's been a hideous 48 years  but it's not for us to judge   well     answer me  i just want a suit   you make me sick   you're buying him a suit  no  he's buying a suit   i work here  oh   it really looks quite lovely on you   why didn't you tell me   well  i wanted to buy freddie a new coat for his screening tonight   but we couldn't afford it   and you know how he needs to feel that he's the one supporting us   i didn't want him to know i'd taken this job   oh  stuart   look  there's stuart  and he's with some young man   wait  why is violet with him   please don't let her make me try on speedos again   what is stuart doing   freddie must never know   the important thing is that we let him keep his dignity  of course   hey  stu  i need you to clean the staff room toilet   oh  yes  mr harrison   what about your dignity   oh  long gone   oh  my god   stuart's working here and he was too embarrassed to let me know   how come  well  look at me  i have my career   he's just a shop girl   it's clear he's ashamed   after all  my opinion means the world to him   now  he can never know that i know   do you understand  of course   i think he's seen us  what do we do   follow my lead   so it's true   freddie  what are you doing here  what am i doing here   i'm very innocently buying swimming trunks for ash   when i think it's all too clear what you're doing   it is  you're having an affair with this whore   hey   oh  sorry  you're getting that a lot  today   no  it's not what you think   i think it's very obvious to everybody what's going on here   wouldn't you say so  ash   not really   all right  yes  i was considering having an affair   i knew it  jezebel   yeah  but i couldn't do it   i never had any real feelings for    gerard wilkinson   i hope you can forgive me   it's going to take a very  very long time   and i shall probably lash out at you in cruel ways  so be prepared   you stinking pile of turd   oh  thank you for being so understanding   so freddie still has absolutely no idea  none   he still thinks that i almost had an affair   freddie  hurry up  dear  we don't want to be late   don't rush me  you cheating slut   and he's being very decent about it   you two have a twisted relationship  you do know that   all couples are like this   you wouldn't understand  because you're all alone   oh  ash  but i thought you were bringing your girlfriend     it actually didn't work out  after all  oh  i'm sorry to hear that   would you excuse me a moment   violet  could you entertain ash   you remember our friend  violet   i don't understand  ash  i thought you were back together   we were  but then i saw what stuart did for freddie    taking a job and not letting him know   you knew stuart was working there   i kind of figured it out   he did that because he wanted freddie to think  he was still able to support them both   his acting work isn't as frequent as it used to be  i'm afraid   yeah  i kind of figured that out too   you're a little brighter than i gave you credit for  ash   anyway  it made me realise i wasn't ready  to make that kind of sacrifice for tracey  so i ended it   i want the kind of love they have  one day   where is that miserable piece of shit   i'm right here  you walking corpse   this is for you   if your hands can stop shaking long enough  maybe you can open it   the coat i wanted   i thought you could wear it  tonight   i am very proud of you   tenth most popular villain   thank you   oh  you look quite dashing   and you don't look as revolting as you usually do   let's go   let me just finish my last sip    there   ash  i thought you were bringing your girlfriend   we're not together any more   did she take an overdose   no  she just wasn't the right girl   well  it's important you find the right one   or you could get stuck with some useless moron for 1 000 years  like i did   god  i hate you   it's your fault  how is it my fault   it was last week  you're in charge of the diary   your fault   you said it was this week  well  i've got a lot going on   you have nothing going on   you stay at home all day  eating chocolates   you'd think you could remember one thing   i'm returning that coat  good   i don't want anything from you   tea  yes  please
