all over the place   political diaries  conspiracy theories  even ghost stories   no first name  no last name  just the doctor  always the doctor   the title seems to be passed from father to son  like an inheritance   that's your doctor there  isn't it   yeah  i tracked it down to the washington public archive  last year   the online photo's enhanced  but if we look at the original     november 22nd 1963  the assassination of president kennedy  see   must be his father   going further back     april 1912   this is a photograph of the daniels family of southampton  and friend     taken the day before they were due to go to the new world  on the titanic   but for some unknown reason  they cancelled the trip  and survived   and here we are      look  the same lineage  he's identical     this one washed up on the sumatran coast  the night krakatoa exploded   the doctor is a legend  woven throughout history   when disaster comes  he's there   he brings the storm in his wake  and has one constant companion  who's that   death   if the doctor's back  if you've seen him  rose   one thing's for certain   we're all in danger   come on then  if he singled you out  if the doctor's making house calls       then god help you   bin roars  bin burps but who is he   who d'you think he is   i think he's the same man   i think he's immortal  i think he's an alien from another

creature   well  tip in your antiplastic and let's go  i'm not here to kill it  i've got to give it a chance   i seek audience with the nestene consciousness under peaceful contract  according to
