the house is owned by marcus and lucy payne     young marrieds  no kids   our people kicked the front door in   find lucy payne bleeding on the carpet  she'd been assaulted   she's in hospital   suspect  marcus payne  goes for pc morrisey with a machete   by the time the paramedics arrived  dennis was dead   ritual strangulation  torture   then there's that   one of these five girls is still unaccounted for   now find me that missing girl   just bring her home  eh   just so i'm clear  janet   you hit marcus payne on the wrist with your baton    and he dropped the machete    yeah   this is as vicious a beating as i've seen   i think the culprit should be arrested   annie's from professional standards   you'll remember them as complaints and discipline  alan     you don't have to put it with it  lucy    it's none of your business     marcus payne's dead    yeah  i know     i need to find leanne wray    i can't do it     it's ok  lucy    don't touch me    six hours ago   he never fully regained consciousness   you told me he was gonna pull through   i was wrong  but we all get it wrong sometime  don't we   we'll need to book in a full post mortem as soon as possible   what   this is now a suspicious death and janet taylor     forget all that     how can i forget that    cos five girls are gone  four dead  one still unaccounted for   with this piece of shit dead  we need to figure out  how we find leanne wray  not     sorry about this   yes  win   sir  arlene brown  leanne's best mate   she's positively identified the green vw  as the vehicle that took leanne wray   i'll liaise with the coroner's office   get him ready for the pathologist as soon as poss  like lunchtime   sure   sir   hold the witness there   i'm on my way   now he's dead  if this thing goes to court   janet taylor becomes a heroine   i don't want that   payne may have been a killer  but we're not a bunch of rednecks   she was fighting for her life  sir  payne had sliced open her partner   if she admits to it  we can deal with it internally   avoid criminal proceedings   confession and resignation  that's as good as it's gonna get for janet taylor   ok   get the post mortem and get a confession   sir   rydell   arlene   i'm detective chief inspector alan banks   your witness statement  you say the car pulled up  and leanne went over to speak to the driver  yes   yeah  leanne got in the back of the car and then she went   she got in the back of the car   that's not what it says in your original statement   it just says she got in the car  it doesn't say back or front   think carefully  arlene   did leanne get in the back         or the front of the car   back   ok  now  i'm leanne  all right   now  before i get in the back  i'm talking to someone in the car   now  am i like this         or like this     like that    he had an accomplice     man  or woman    i don't know  it were too dark   all right  arlene   you've helped  you've helped a lot   there were two of them   so if she's not in the house  where is she   payne can't tell us  but his accomplice can  who is it   lucy   you saw the set up in that house  ken   he drives his victims home  parks up at the side  and takes them straight to the cellar   we know he abused lucy  controlled her  she's terrified of him   so terrified  she helped him abduct those girls   she was probing me to find out how seriously injured payne was   because if he's alive  he can contradict her  incriminate her   ok  but we have another suspect  jackie wray   five girls disappear  all heading home alone after a late night   payne and his accomplice get them in an isolated spot  offer them a lift   best way to persuade them into a car is to have a woman with you   especially a young  pretty girl like lucy   two blokes  no chance   i'm not ruling it out   i'll have another crack at lucy  see how she takes the news that her husband's dead   ken  i want you to run all the rogue prints from payne's house against jackie wray's   we find the accomplice  we find leanne   there was no resistance   no sign of defensive wounds to his hands or arms   it's very simple  marcus payne was killed  by a series of repeated blows to the head   while either kneeling or sitting   i'm sorry    about earlier   we'd just lost him  i shouldn't have taken it out on you   i could do with a favour   i need to re interview lucy payne   i'd feel more comfortable if there was a female officer present   last time i looked  you have eight female officers on your team   i thought you might like to get involved  informally   a bit of cid experience   i've been tasked with investigating the death of marcus payne   and lucy payne was in that house  when the incident you're investigating took place   marcus payne had an accomplice   lucy   thank you   alan   i was going to call you   why   i don't know  i just feel safe when you're here   is marcus    how is he   this is my colleague  detective sergeant annie cabbot   hi   you usually come alone   don't you trust yourself with me   i'm joking   sorry  i'm   trying to stay sane   we have evidence that your husband had an accomplice   marcus   no   he doesn't have friends  he keeps himself to himself  we both do   he says that i'm his best friend   you think     you don't think that     is that what he told you   what did he    what did he say i did   marcus didn't tell us anything   he died earlier this morning  lucy   the other night  let's go over it again   you took him down a cup of tea   he kept the cellar door locked   i'd leave the tea outside   same routine every night   i never went in  i       i was too scared  i knew if i went in that he'd hit me   he was in the garage  getting something from the car   he he he left the cellar unlocked and i couldn't help it   i looked in and i saw her and i       i tried to run away    upstairs   yeah   but he caught me and   then he hit me   why didn't he kill you   you'd just seen a dead girl in his cellar   he'd killed before  he knew how to kill   why not kill you  to stop you from talking     it's ok  love   we're here to help you   for christ's sake  do you think we're bloody stupid    why didn't he kill you   you lived with him day in  day out  he abducted those girls   brought them back to your house  kept them alive for days  while he raped  tortured  then killed them   and you didn't suspect a thing   you're telling us you'd never once been to  that cellar before the other night  come on  lucy   if you're innocent  if you didn't help him   you discovered he was a killer and rapist  why didn't he kill you   because     because i         i promised him i wouldn't tell   i loved him  i still love him   what is it  lucy     i came as soon as i could    marcus died last night   maybe it's for the best   oh  really   the police  they're saying that marcus had an accomplice   they think it was me  maggie   no  i wouldn't worry about it  lucy   it's         because they lost marcus  they're feeling cheated   so now they're looking for someone else to blame   i need a lawyer   i don't have any money  marcus took care of that   and there's no one else  maggie   you're the only one who knows what i'm going through     me  how      he told me about your affair with him   boasted about it   it's ok  don't look so worried   i forgive you   you were lonely and pathetic and marcus feeds on that   i won't tell on you   you're my friend  maggie   i need   2 000   if you could write me a cheque   like  now   thank you  maggie   i know  whatever happens  you'll take care of me   you can go now  i'm tired   can i speak to someone  please  like a reporter   i have    i know things   i have information about marcus payne     win  tell him i've approved that    chief inspector     sir    one of your people has been talking to the papers   oh  no way  sir  not my team   maybe it came from your office   now  we've all failed here  alan  let's not make it worse  ok     i don't know what you      sir   excuse me   dvds found in payne's cellar   we pulled prints from them   plenty of marcus payne   but there's a second set on almost every cover     lucy    jackie wray   sorry  sir   marcus payne's dead   the pm report on marcus payne   this worries me  janet   three blows delivered to the top of his head   while payne was sitting or squatting   you can see the depth of the wounds  the angle of the blows   the position of the victim   the victim    how can you call him a victim   i watched him kill dennis   he raped and murdered those other girls  and now you're sitting there  calling him a victim   what's wrong with you    after you handcuffed marcus payne  did you hit him   the man is dead   as a result of a series of blows from your baton     what do you want from me    change your statement   i'm trying to help you  janet   i can keep this out of court   an internal disciplinary matter   but you need to tell the truth   you and dennis were having an affair   it's all over the station   we need to get this sorted  janet   i was fighting for my life  for god's sake   dennis    dennis was bleeding   and it    it was all spinning and         i was really pumped up     and i hit him    while he was handcuffed   janet   while he was handcuffed   i don't know how many times  i     i just lost it   and you're prepared to alter your statement to that effect   there'll be an internal disciplinary hearing   but it stays in house   i'm sorry  janet  i really am   your career's gone   but not your life   you have my word on that   jackie wray   what

don't know   maybe you do   marcus payne had an accomplice   these were found in payne's cellar   all with your prints on   no  i don't     i don't remember payne     i don't remember him    what are you talking about  jackie     of course you remember payne    i don't remember him   you're looking guilty  jackie   all right  look     this         it's knock off   i've got a stall down on eastvale market   i sell them under the counter   but i don't remember selling them to payne   i'm not his accomplice  for christ's sake     i had nothing to do with it    you sold this to marcus payne    that gives a nutter like him permission  to rape  murder and mutilate young girls   like it or not  jackie  and maybe not legally   but you were payne's accomplice   where's leanne  eh   where is she   cos you're supposed to protect us   so  where's my leanne  eh   you  you're the accomplice   you and payne   you killed them  you killed them   you killed them   get back in here now  banks   you and payne   you kill them girls   you killed them   you killed them girls   sir   lucy payne   he real name's lucy godwin   she was one of the children in the alderthorpe abuse case   god   all four kids abused by their own parents   classic psychopathology  sex and violence inextricably associated   emotionally desensitised   drained of empathy   the abused becomes the abuser   lucy's the accomplice   it's ugly  but it's closure   you realise i'm gonna have to use all this to break her   this isn't about you  alan   i was arrested  held overnight  released without charge   so  name and shame them   the task force investigating the disappearance of my leanne  and those four other girls     chief superintendent rydell  alan banks     they have failed the lot of us   and then they accuse me of killing my own daughter   got a new girlfriend   i need to talk to you   you can't keep away  can you  alan   is he allowed to talk to me   that depends   jessica ford  lucy's solicitor   good   i was gonna suggest that you get representation     i've taking you few question      on what grounds   on the grounds of being involved in the abduction and murder  of samantha foster  melissa horrocks  kelly matthews  kimberley myers  and the suspected disappearance of leanne wray     i wouldn't do anything like that    why not   because it's wrong   my friend maggie thinks you're trying to demonise me  because you lost marcus   because you're angry you didn't catch him   because you failed  alan   you only hate me because you hate yourself   her friend  maggie  margaret forest   she's responsible for this   yeah  i thought she was my friend   she was having an affair with marcus   there's a lot of press gathering out there   we'll have a car standing by round the back   get her ready for two o'clock     mrs forest    i'm in a hurry   you released information to the newspaper about our investigation     who told you that    lucy   she's blackmailing me   she alleges you were having an affair with marcus payne   is there something you want to tell us  mrs forest   ok  cell b   annie  this is jack whittaker  cps   jack  my favourite ds  annie cabbot   cps   janet taylor's confession you extracted   it's good work   so good  we can't sweep it under the carpet   she handcuffed marcus payne to the rail  and hit him repeatedly with 'tremendous force'     there was no intent    that's for a jury to decide   i talked her into changing her statement   you told me this would stay internal   this could make your career  don't blow it   ok  jack  what's the minimum you'd go for     justifiable homicide    it's not self defence     voluntary manslaughter    how long   six to eighteen months   arrest her  annie   ds cabbot   just keep going  347   we'll stop these reporters and catch you up   get us out of here   are you ok   are you ok      get out of the car  jackie    she killed my leanne   she killed her  she killed her   sir   sir   ok  ok  ok  ok   why

suspicion of manslaughter   what   i'm sorry  janet  you're under arrest   you're not sorry     you're just a treacherous bitch    you're drunk  janet     so what  you'd be drunk if you     like you were drunk the night  you murdered marcus payne  lab report   your coffee was laced with vodka   you were having an affair with a married man   and when marcus payne attacked your married man   you clubbed him to death in a drunken rage   so don't you dare judge me  get in the car   how long have you and marcus payne been together   four and a half years   how's your daughter     how did you meet    in a night club     why    what attracted you to him   he satisfied me   sexually  and i'm not easily satisfied sexually   i bet you're the perfect dad   you claim marcus payne abused you   violently  sexually  mentally   he did that  with an iron   yet despite that  you were dedicated to him   devoted   i did what i was told  for my own good   including the murder and abduction of samantha foster     i bet your daughter adores you and you love it  don't you   did you ever have thoughts about her  when she was a little girl  growing up   growing little titties     where's leanne wray    i've seen the way you look at me   i don't blame you  alan  i do that to men     bring out the worst in them   even good men like you   and really  there's no such thing as a good man   believe me  i know it   and you know where leanne wray is  don't you   how would i know that   alderthorpe   we know that you're lucy godwin   we also know that you were systematically abused   beaten  raped   kept in a cage  for the first ten years of your life   by your family     they humiliated you    inspector   you   your little brothers   sisters   cousins   they took away your childhood  and made you bitter   vengeful  why wouldn't it     excuse me    and when you met  marcus payne  and he was just like your father   your mothers  your uncles  your aunts     you couldn't help yourself  could you    i need a word with my client   you wanted vengeance on someone  anyone   on samantha  melissa  kelly  kimberley   you did it  didn't you  lucy   you and marcus payne   you were destroyed  so you destroyed those girls   you and marcus  you met     did he see it in you  you saw it in him   the dark stuff   you sensed it   you brought out the worst in each other  didn't you   do unto others as they did to you   you did it  didn't you  lucy    yes  i did it   lucy payne  i'm arresting you on suspicion of being an accessory       no    of muder       i'm not going    lucy  it's ok     i'm not going    lucy  lucy   it's all right  it's all right   calm yourself down  for christ's sake   get off me  don't you touch me   no  please  no   she goes back to hospital  but under guard  ok   but she did this and she's going away for it   and she's going to tell me where leanne wray is   please   no  no  no   lucy's confessed   i'm sorry   i just moved here to get away from a man   an an an abusive man   and    i just didn't want anyone to know i'd been with marcus   if my name came up  my husband would find me   so you went to the papers   put the spotlight on lucy as the accomplice   well  i suppose i was right  lucy is the accomplice   you could have derailed our inquiry   you've disqualified yourself as a key witness   it's possible lucy's defence lawyer will argue   cos of the story you fed the papers   it'll be impossible for her to have a fair trial   it's possible  because of you   a killer will go free   your public's waiting   shit   all right   lucy  this is dr keighly   lucy   he wants to talk to you about your relationship with marcus   marcus' world is my world   when i first met marcus  it was like he'd         always known me   he liked to hurt me   he liked to control me  and he understood how much i needed to be hurt and controlled   i tried to be normal   ordinary   felt all wrong   marcus knew that  he smelt it   he worked on me  until i'd do anything he wanted   you gonna eat the last bit of pakora   doesn't this bother you     what    janet taylor  the way rydell screwed you over   yeah   a bit   and it's a tough break for janet  but she did what she did     like lucy payne    it's not the same   come on  alan   i've had a shit day  so have you  we're off duty here   why are you a cop   oh  i don't know   money's decent and i like everything neat and tidy  ok   bad guys punished  good guys rewarded   but i don't live and breathe it  because i don't want to end up like     me   marcus used me to get them in the car   we'd offer them a lift   and then  once were in a quiet road   we'd stop on some excuse   marcus would get in the back and knock her unconscious   then we'd take her home    to the cellar   marcus liked me to watch while he raped and strangled her   that was my role  to watch   and then i'd help him clean up afterwards   i felt nothing   lucy   can you tell us about leanne wray   professional standards is a bloody ghetto   everybody hates you   even when you get it right  you get it wrong   janet taylor being a case in point   i want to be doing what you're doing   no  you don't   no  you don't  i do   i'm applying for a transfer into cid   so     i was wondering if you'd put a word in for me   so this is the sting     you get close to me and      no         i sort your career for you    it's not like that   what is it like then  annie   yes  sir   i'll be right there   i have to go   lucy payne  or rather lucy godwin   has been diagnosed as suffering from a condition known as  folie a deux    that's french  alan   don't be a prick  sir   coming from where lucy came from   lucy was vulnerable  ripe  if you like         to come under the influence of a psycho sexual predator  like marcus payne   he groomed her  his disorder became her disorder   lucy was not in control of her actions   she needs treatment  not punishment   the cps agree  i agree  the medics agree   she was in control of her actions  she's not ill   for god's sake  alan   the adults who were supposed to love and protect her  abused her  degraded her  humiliated her   there's nothing to be gained in prosecuting lucy payne   all we get is a media circus   another frenzied hunt to find her siblings and cousins     all living quiet lives under new identities   and make them relive their nightmare childhood   what about the families of lucy payne's victims   marcus payne's victims   those families have closure     marcus payne killed their daughters   we've only found four bodies   leanne wray's still missing   apparently     she put up too much of a struggle when she got in the car   so payne had to kill her there and then   then they had to get rid of the body quickly   where   she hasn't told us  and you're not the person to ask   annie cabbot   a woman's touch   lucy will cooperate  show us where the body's buried  and you  alan         you're taking a month off   and when you come back   i'm putting you in permanent command of east yorkshire cid   you're the least worst candidate i can find   sarge  found her   ok   come on   lucy    banks  don't do this   you lied to me  lucy   banks  stop this   when i said you were involved in the abduction and rape         and murder of those girls  you said you wouldn't do anything like that   and i said   why wouldn't you do anything like that    what did you say  what was your answer     sir    just back off   all of you   why wouldn't you rape  torture and murder those girls   what was your answer    because it's wrong   wrong   do you understand what that means   do you understand what  wrong  means    that was leanne wray   she was 17 years old when you and marcus took her life   she wrote awful poetry   she fought with her mum   she loved her stupid moron of a dad   she stayed out late   she studied hard  because she wanted to be a vet   she worked in a coffee bar at weekends   you see  the thing is  lucy   she wasn't a saint   or an angel  like they said in the papers   she was an ordinary girl   like the others   flawed   daft  smart   human   like you  lucy   i need you to be better than marcus  and your parents   your family  all those animals   see  that         is wrong   please   lucy  please   please   help me   please     feel something   i want to plead guilty   i did this   i'm sorry   can i have a minute  thanks   what did they offer you   voluntary manslaughter     if i plead guilty    tell them  'no deal'     but i was drunk    no  you weren't   analysis of your coffee   hasn't gone into my report yet   come on  janet   thank you   sir   i'm recommending you for a transfer   to my unit     east yorkshire cid   you're ambitious  ruthless and amoral   every team needs a player like that
