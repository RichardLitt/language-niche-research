just want to read it for inspiration   ok   it's just    it's meant to be a personal statement  about what you think of the syllabus and     i know  it's just  it's late   if i had a wrap of speed and a little bag of weed and some  proper coffee and some pro plus and night nurse  and some mushrooms and some books  i could bang out a statement  in half an hour and it would be brilliant  but i don't   i might have strepsils somewhere   yeah  but i'm still a bit pissed  and i can't think of why i want to do  english right now  i thought i should probably put something about books   this isn't a big deal for you  is it   what  no   no  it's not like i spent any time on it or anything   i whacked it out watching tv  i haven't even read it   why read something if you've written it   can i just see

sparking  i'm vibing   right   but    if you're going to hand a new one in   i might like  just  put my name on the one you've already written   yeah  that would be cool  yeah  why not   cos it'd be

my soul   what a bitch   yeah  i thought so   it was going well until she said that she believes  quite strongly   that sexual impulses are sent by satan to lure us into a trap   which ends with our souls frying like bacon for eternity   so  she tricked you   you should be ashamed   sorry   targeting a lonely  sexually frustrated guy   just cos you've picked out the weak antelope in the herd   i think it's more like they target power brokers  opinion formers   he was interested   no  he was not   you snared him in  because     because    well  because    you're hot  ok   that's a fact  i

lot of rumours in this department   a lot of    shittle tattle   but whatever you hear   or have heard about me and my relationships with human beings   is very unlikely to be true   ok  good  so     your statements of intent   excellent   you're not going to read them    i've filed them for reading later   but i feel we can now move on to the actual      readin' and discussin' of the books   so
