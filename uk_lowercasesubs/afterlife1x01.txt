shared by http   djj home sapo pt        hey  what's going on   hey  no fighting tonight  not at christmas   mother  are you tired   help  help   help  help  help  help   no  mummy   morning  nice to see a new face around here at last   same old face when i last looked  unfortunately    cheers   see you       will you leave me be   will you leave me be   leave me be   someone is making themselves known to me  and he's telling me       he's telling me you have a scar on your knee   i do  as a matter of fact  yeah   i feel there's been someone spiritual in your life   because you're not conventionally spiritual   but you care about the world   he's telling me you have this  tremendous inner potential which you need to push   because you're a bit lazy  my friend  is that right  i'm sorry   you see how it works  it's all there  i'm just bouncing off what i see    an old hippy  no offence   none taken   i'm a clich   i can't help it   what i've done is called cold reading  and anybody can do it if they put the hours in   so how'd you know about the scar on his knee  then   what little boy doesn't have a scar on his knee   who wears a greenpeace badge if he doesn't care about the world   who doesn't feel they aren't a bit lazier than they ought to be   just because it can be faked doesn't mean it is faked   come on  jen   it's a way these so called psychics have of saying   ''i'm special  i have a gift  you need me '' a mutual dependency   so you'd reject anybody's beliefs in something beyond the material world   well  i wouldn't reject anybody's belief  but that's all it is  a belief   which is what we'll be looking at over the next 1 2 weeks  ''psychology and belief''   do all your course reading and don't be late for lectures   oh  and don't forget thursday   we're going to be entering the belly of the beast      alison mundy   yes   bless you   my name's colin yearsly  this is my wife marigold   we wanted to make ourselves known to you  my love  that's all   just to let you know you have many friends here in bristol   wait  a minute  how do you know me  how do you know where i live   the internet is a marvellous invention   we have a platform session later next week   no  i'm sorry  that's not possible    pardon  excuse me   i'm sorry  things have changed   i know what you want  but i don't do that any more   that's why i came to live here  for a new life  for a new      yes  a life   but we thought      i don't see why my opinion isn't the most important thing   why i have to quote all the sources   why i have to regurgitate other people's theories rather than my own   that's what everybody says   you've got to think the references aren't this burden  this hassle   they're your ammunition   ammunition for what  what's the point   well  your degree  for a start   i want to help people  i don't want to write books   it just doesn't seem relevant  you know  at all   i might as well be doing  i don't know  anthropology or something   listen   phil and co  they exercise their jaws a lot   it doesn't make them any brighter than you  far from it  i'd say   yeah  but you want this in by friday  and i don't have the books any more   forget the books  forget friday  go away and think about it   no  go away and don't think about it   relax  come back and talk to me in a week    see how you feel then   what if i feel the same   if you feel the same  then i'll switch to anthropology     he's telling me  harry's telling me      his illness was a relatively short one  is that right    no   no   well  in the spirit world  it's all the blink of an eye  yes   now  there's someone over here  in this part of the auditorium   i'm getting something about a service   a car needing a service  an mot coming up  something like that   is that you   somebody recently passed away  left you a car  you're worried about it   well  sell it  he says  get the worry off your chest  all right  my love   well  that's enough from me tonight  thank you very much indeed   now  our next medium is not so well known to you as myself   she's only been doing it for a few years but she's made quite a stir in her own patch   will you welcome please  alison mundy     thank you   i  i      never      i never really know what to say on occasions like these  except to rabbit on and on  and see what happens   sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't   because  i'm      i'm not in charge  you see  they are   sometimes it's embarrassing  sometimes we sit around for hours  and then we just go home   it's horrible weather tonight  isn't it   nobody wants to come out to play tonight   it's bitter   my auntie vi used to      yes   yes   uh huh   hello   hello   uh huh   okay   did you  okay  all right   may 1 5 written over your head  madam  does that make sense   madam  i've got a little girl over here   and she   she's saying that she hated hospital   she absolutely hated it  does that make sense  yes   and  uh  all right   okay  now she's stroking her hair  she's got beautiful long hair  she loves it   she's very proud of it   it's long  it's blond  golden hair and she's saying that this is how it was before   does that make sense  yes   that's why she's here  because she wants you to see her hair  and that she's safe and that she's loved   she's okay  you're not to worry    does that make sense   yeah   okay  thank you   excuse me  dear   excuse me   you  with the     you've got sort of red bits in your hair   like little bits of red in it   there's a woman standing behind you  she's wearing a white coat   she's got shoulder length dark hair  dark curly hair   it's  uh  a reddish colour  it's not like yours  it's not dye   it's her natural colour  and she's standing behind you  she's looking down at you   and      there's some      there's a very strong scent of lavender  does that make sense   no  okay   she's  she's standing behind you  she's got her hand on your shoulder  very  very close   it's almost like she's your guardian angel   oh  the sadness   there's so much sadness coming off her   and she's saying   she's saying  ''i'm sorry  i'm sorry  i'm sorry''  again and again   does that make sense  no   it's a very  very strong smell of lavender   mystic meg really got you going  didn't she  whoo hoo hoo   i thought she seemed terrified up there half the time   full marks for novelty  but under that it was the same old  same old    she was all right  come on   no  she wasn't  she was rubbish   it was a lovely evening    thank you for coming   thank you  my love    goodbye   bye bye    no  i

worrying you  i hope    that nonsense the other night   you must be joking    are you sure   yes  i'm sure   of course i'm sure  do you want it to be   i just don't want you turning it round in your mind  that's all    woman in white  guardian angel  ghostly figure      all right  i get the message   oh  come on  v  you boring old fart   no  you guys go    i could do with an early night   ''i

child  help    it's lavender lady  be afraid  be very afraid   grow up   gloves   bye bye   robert  good morning   where's veronica    barbara  have you got a minute   not now  robert    no  please  this is important   sorry   here you go  thanks    barbara  please   not now please  robert  i haven't got time   veronica vase  first year student  i think she has problems   she's not attending my lectures  any lectures  i'm worried about her   yes  look  i'd better come clean  she came to my office the other day   she talked about you bugging her all the time  hassling her    why didn't you say   i know   i said i'd talk to you  but she wouldn't have it   she made me promise i wouldn't  she was really uptight about it   did she tell you about our evening with bristol's answer to doris stokes   she just said she wanted to change courses   i thought i'd talked her out of it  but she wasn't listening half the time   i didn't want to push it  i had a word with her personal tutor   and  well   robert  all sorts of people become psychology students   health visitors  psychiatric nurses   sometimes people who've seen the system from the other side   veronica  i keep thinking she's there  in the room  looking down at me   she doesn't exist  veronica   that's where you're wrong  you see  i know who she is   her pride and joy  my dad wanted her to have a fur coat more than she did   this is your mother   dad was a vet   he knew that sometimes nature is cruel   sometimes it was up to human beings to be kind   i used to think that all the animals he put to sleep  did go to sleep   that they were all snoozing   all the cats  the dogs   in some forest somewhere   waiting to wake up   she had cancer   dad left a note saying he didn't want to live in a world without her in it   he loved her too much  he loved us all too much   they both did   i was the only one who survived   my mum  my dad  my brother andrew   why me   i wasn't the littlest  or the biggest   i was just   me   a pact   your mother and father planned it together   we always did everything as a family   i tried so hard  all these years  to put it behind me   it is behind you  you survived    this is nothing but coincidence   is it   she put lavender water around the house   she put lavender under our pillows   i put lavender on her grave   what has she come back for   to tell me something  to warn me  what   it's doing my head in not knowing   alison can tell me   that's the last person you should see   i am seeing her  tomorrow   my name's robert bridge  i'm veronica vase's psychology lecturer   oh   i was aware of a certain degree of negativity from your part of the audience   i'm surprised you didn't say   well  what's important is the vast majority who come with open minds   even mediums go to the supermarket  robert    even mediums do scratch cards   psychologists do  too  i'm told   oh  no  i'm sorry  psychologists study scratch cards  don't they    no  it's a little early for me   it's almost too late for me   listen  i don't want to be disrespectful to your beliefs      why not  i'm quite likely to be disrespectful of yours   i'm worried about veronica's state of mind  she's susceptible to      susceptible  what do you mean exactly  susceptible   with respect  i've got a terrific student   whose world has been turned upside down  thanks to what you said to her the other night   yes  i know  that's why i'm seeing her  to try and help her sort this out   no  no  you don't understand   what makes you think it's me that doesn't understand    listen      no  you listen to me  okay   the woman was standing like this   she was wearing a white coat   she was looking down at veronica  and she had her hand on her shoulder  like this   i saw her as clearly as i see you now   if you ask me  there's nothing wrong with her a good seeing to        i fancy getting totally hammered     memorise the card  memorising   right  slide it back into the thing  into the deck    yes   yes   i know you've seen it  but it's good  so shut up   go on  go on   ooh  look   knock it back  v    did you enjoy that   yeah   one of those  right  and now the cards are somewhere   she has deep psychological problems   so isn't it better that they're confronted  resolved  instead of denied   i'd have thought that that made perfect psychological sense  robert   obviously  i'm wasting my time   oh yeah  it's the easiest thing in the world to turn your back  to dismiss  to sneer   you've got no idea what people like me have to go through   what we have to suffer  what we have to see   have you got any idea what it's like to wake in the middle of the night   hear weeping  knowing that it doesn't come from anybody living   and that you're the only person who can help to take their pain away  do you    i can't imagine   no  of course you can't   psychologists  psychiatrists   you're all the same   funny farms are full of people like me   once upon a time  they used to burn people like me at the stake    now it's lithium and ect   you took the words right out of my mouth   yeah  but they don't work  robert  you see  that's the thing   what  you think that i wouldn't take medication if it did   i'd run away if i could   i'd cut them out with a rusty knife  if i could   but i don't have any choice   you don't choose the spirits  they choose you   maybe      maybe veronica's opened a door that you've got firmly shut   maybe that's what this is all about   that's your answer then  is it   your precious spirits mean more to you than the well being of a young girl   this isn't just about veronica    maybe her mother needs peace   her mother is dead   she doesn't come making guest appearances in bingo halls on a thursday night    i can't help you  i'm sorry   yes   yes  you can  if you wanted to   i envy your certainty  your safety  does it make you happy   yes   and what would you say if i said that i can see a little child   aged about six  right now  in the corner   who's to say that that little child isn't there just because you can't see it   who's to say that you're right and i'm wrong   who's to say that i'm mad and you're sane   is it a boy or a girl  you've got a 50 50 chance of getting it right   oh      you know it's a little boy   you've obviously done your homework   robert  i know it's there somewhere   woman  look  robert  i promise you  if you left it here  it's gone to oxfam   oxfam   freud's interpretation of dreams  oxfam   it was a paperback  buy another copy  wh smith   6 95   it had all my little notes in the margin  and everything   well  sorry   you'll have to make up some new notes all over again   it's not the same   i know  i know it's not   how fast can you move your tongue  come on  show me your tongue   no  i'm not showing you my tongue   just waggle    mine is fast   oh  my god   come on  you love it   look at that guy  that guy over there  he's peeing     phil  filthy bastards   stop the car  stop  stop the car   stop it  please   please  please stop   i told you  she's been gearing up for a bloody hughie all evening    phil  shut up   no  you go  go on   i'll be all right  i'll walk it  it's only two minutes   i'll come with you  you guys head off  are you okay  babe   just leave me alone  will you   i'm sure it's on the top shelf with the national geographics   robert  for god's sake  this is not exactly convenient   it won't take a second    clive didn't like the old wallpaper  i see   we decided together  actually   robbo  mate  what are you doing here   oh  you know  i was just passing   nose pressed against the window  warm glow inside    very dickensian   come in  have a glass of prosecco    robert's just going  actually   i am  sadly   she who must be obeyed  eh  see you   yeah   you were never dickensian  much more dostoevsky   dostoevsky with occasional laughs   you'd better go   clive's happy   goodnight  robert   never was good on dreams  was i   take care  jude

or something  did he wake you   no  i'm fast asleep  forget about it   well  i'm sorry  mate   are you happy  veronica   i'm at university  i'm doing what i always dreamt of doing   but there's this gap  there's always this hole   well  maybe it's you that needs to let go of her  not the other way round   do you think so   maybe she wants to hear you say  ''it's okay  mum  you don't have to worry about me   ''you're dead  but i'm here   ''i'm alive and i don't blame you ''  i'm here and i'm alive  yeah   yeah   well then  tell her  tell her now  go on  say it   i'm alive  mum   no  louder than that  'cause she can't hear you   mum  i'm alive   mum  i'm alive  i am alive    better late than never   great    how are you   i'm fine  i'm brilliant   seeing her again made you realise what a load of old nonsense it is  really   she made me realise i have to move on   to the place i want to be  never mind anyone else    she made a lot of sense  for a lunatic   good  i'm glad   barbara  this alison sounds interesting   if you're interested in deluded  disassociated hysterics   well  you are  aren't you    i'd make the most of her  if i were you   is this wine corked   what about one book about one person  finding out what makes her tick    digging deep   psychos and psychics  it's old ground   it's the book you've waited your whole academic life to write  and it's landed in your lap    i'd better make tracks  i've got an essay to read   think about it    could be a match made in heaven   yeah  or hell  you haven't met her   get off me    great  i thought we said  ''wait up''   she can microwave it for breakfast   do you think it gets to her    what   us    do you think we should cool it a little   oh  no  no    come on   ''i really need an early night ''  ''do you need an early night ''     wait  wait  wait  let's run a bath   what   i was being romantic  romantique   what's this   oh  shit   phil  who's this  mate  get off the line   get off the     robert no mate  listen  it's veronica    phil  phil  calm down  what's going on   i need to call an ambulance   oh  hell  she's bleeding again   she's getting tachycardic   do you want me to stop  do you want me to stop   that's it  she's into vf   alison  it's robert bridge  what the hell did you say to her    charge to 200   charging   right  hands off  stand back  stand clear  please   clear    what have they said   she's still in surgery   what the hell is she doing here   doctor  stand clear  clear   hallelujah  brothers  back in the land of the living   talk to me   i didn't say anything to her   i just tried to help her move on   i said  ''your mother's dead  but you're alive  that's the point ''   are you veronica's family   no  she doesn't have any family   i'm her university lecturer  these are her friends   well  as you know  when she came in  veronica had already lost an awful  tremendous lot of blood   she's gonna pull through  yeah   we obviously   with the shock to the system  it was touch and go   but veronica died a few minutes ago   i'm really very sorry  but we really did do everything we possibly could     she's here   veronica's mother's standing right over there   she's looking straight at me   she's smiling   and veronica's by her side   bitch  you bloody bitch  you don't care  do you   you did this  you killed her   you and your stupid bloody ideas  you should get put away   get out of here   robert  it's death  always   that punches out the god shaped hole in our modern lives   if god is the father  then he's not only abandoned his child   he refuses to pay maintenance   and like a lot of errant fathers  he's difficult to track down in times of trouble   robert  i know it's late  alison  i couldn't sleep  either      do you want a drink   yes  thanks   thank you   you blame me  don't you   i'm responsible  too   i should have seen it earlier  i didn't   her mother kept saying that she was sorry   but she wasn't sorry for what she did  she was sorry that she didn't take her daughter   sometimes it's like they're playing with us   you know  it's like      it's a bad  sick      joke   i just want it to stop   i just want to be normal  i want to lead a normal life   but i'm not normal  am i   my head of department thinks i should write a book about you    what you do  the people you help   try to   she thinks i should get out of my ivory tower and experience real life for a change   and will it help me to get rid of my demons  this book   i hope so  ultimately   i'm not sure   i thought you were sure of everything  robert   i'll let you get some sleep   thank you  robert   thank you for bothering to come   and remember  what you're looking for is not always what you find   we'll see     we'll see   we'll see
