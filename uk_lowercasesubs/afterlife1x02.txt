   i'm going over megan's to watch monsters inc    can i have some money for crisps and coke   yeah   thanks  dad  hi  stace     i can't go on like this   i feel like a criminal    it'll be all right   how   how will it be all right   are you serious about getting away from this hole    it was you that said it   just give me some time   time  how much time does it take  ray   come on    you all right   no   dss    care in the community more like sometimes   hi   my house husband  where's trouble   out  megan's  dvd   well  you wouldn't believe the day i've had   you know that guy chris  that was giving me all that trouble last week   he started again  i don't know what i'm gonna do with him   hi  megan  yeah  not so bad  can you put carly on  love   what does she like this week  corkscrews or bow ties   what   when was this   carly   carly   police   yeah  police      it's my daughter   carly   carly   carly   my daughter  i can't find her   i can't find her  where is she   well  i suggest initially we get together like this on a regular basis  just to talk   talk   what about  the weather   you  what you do  what you feel about   what you do and see and hear   then i'd like to observe your work as a medium  first hand   oh  so what  i phone you when someone comes to me   yeah  to the extent that you feel comfortable with that  yeah   just your friendly  neighbourhood psychologist  then   exactly   you could do with getting yourself a decent couch   hey  let's be clear about this  this is not a therapy session   good  because if you're expecting to rummage around in my dim and distant past   you're in for a disappointment   when we first met  you intimated you'd spent some time in psychiatric care   hmm   do you have a problem with me finding out more about that   fine    do you remember the name of your consultant   max maynard at stillview in manchester   but he might as well have been a plumber for all he found out about me   all he wanted to do was talk about the accident   accident   how many people are gonna read this book   don't worry  it's a university publication  not a harry potter   reporter   detective inspector felix george of wessex police  has again asked for any members of the public  who have noticed anything unusual in the area to come forward   he reassured them that information would be treated in complete confidence  and said his priority was to find carly safe and well   yes  that's the worst of it  not knowing      if our daughter is alive or dead  that's      that's unbearable   carly's father ray thanked friends  family and neighbours for their support  and said it was now down to the public   he appealed for anyone with information  that could lead police to the whereabouts of his daughter  to look to their conscience and think of the torture he and his wife are suffering   i just want to know if you've fully considered  the psychological state of these people at the moment   you saw that man on tv not knowing if his daughter's dead or alive   he's in hell  that's what i consider  i consider that   what if she is alive  alison  you have to be so careful   you're full of good intentions  aren't you  robert  writing a book about me   one on one sessions in the psychology department   but the minute you see what my life is really like  look at you  you run a mile   i'm not running  i'm being sensitive    a child is missing   no  a child is dead   it's horrible  i know   this is what i do   it isn't easy for you  robert  how easy do you think it is for me    let me at least call them and see      no  no  no  no  i've got to go now   excuse me   journalist  excuse me  who are you   alison   i'd like to speak to liz tufnell please  carly's mum  i've got a message for her   my name's alison mundy   liz  if it's a paper  tell them to get lost   no  i'm not a newspaper  liz  i'm a person   liz  you had a beautiful  beautiful girl  my sweetheart  but she's gone   i've seen her  she's in spirit  she's dead  i'm sorry   i'm so sorry    who are you  what are you saying   i'm sorry   what did you say to her   you parasite  get out of here before i bloody       you've seen her   oh  yes   where is she   now   mrs mundy  if you know where she is  where can we find her      you mean her body   i don't know where her body is   she probably can't face it  that she's dead   she's probably blocking it out totally  poor thing   i sat with her in the supermarket   until they asked me to leave   'cause i was attracting attention   mrs mundy  what evidence do you have that carly tufnell is dead   the evidence of my eyes   she's frightened  she doesn't understand   see  that's why we've got to help her   because if we can find her body   then maybe she can get some peace   that's what i was trying to get out of her  what she remembers  where she was   and all she would say is ''dark''   over and over again   ''dark  dark water ''  and she's crying  she's sobbing   i'm the only one who can hear her   the two of us  in amongst the soup and the baked beans   and what else did she say   what else did she say  what else did she say   she said   ''i'm down  lower than bones ''  yeah   ''lower than bones ''  ''lower than bones ''  i don't wanna hurt you   i want to help you   is this it   all over  then   all the plans   all the happiness   it wasn't happiness that we had  stace  it was just fun   this was found washed up at sea mills   does it match the description given by the parents   same brand  same style  same size   right   right  right  right   okay  everyone  we're gonna concentrate our searches  on all areas upriver from here   and that includes cumberland basin  hotwells and baltic wharf   how long is this gonna take      dr bridge  you wanted to see me   yes  inspector  thanks   i realise you're very busy   but i'm concerned about a woman called alison mundy   she's under the delusion that she's in contact with spirits   so obviously it's important that none of your team  places undue emphasis on anything she might say to you    however      are you saying that she's not very good   i'm saying she's very convincing   dr bridge  i'd like you to step this way   have a listen  and tell me what you think   alison   she's frightened   she doesn't understand   that's why we've got to help her   because  see  if we can find her body   than maybe she can have peace   she's emotionally unstable  as you can tell from the voice   i'm worried that this self imposed pressure might be damaging to her   as well as anything else   alison   all she would say is ''dark'  over and over again   ''dark  dark water  ''  psychics and mediums tend to speak in generalities  for instance  ''water''   everywhere is near water  a river  water pipes  something   it doesn't mean anything significant   alison   and she's crying  she's sobbing   and i'm there with her   i'm the only one who can hear her   the two of us  in amongst the soup and the baked beans   and what else did she say   what else did she say  what else did she say   she said   ''i'm down  lower than bones  ''  robert  she plucks something out of the air  doesn't even know she's doing it   lower than bones   it sounds so specific  you think it must be true   alison  ''lower than bones  ''  ''lower than bones  ''      where was she  boys    down there  sir   there   announcer   and now the headlines   we've just received word within the last few minutes   that the police have confirmed that the body of a young girl  found near the baltic wharf area of bristol   is that of missing schoolgirl carly tufnell   the police have confirmed that they are now dealing with a murder enquiry   we made an appointment in the name of watkins   are you prepared to see us   she had this silver balloon  that one of her friends brought to her birthday party   it's still sitting there in the front room  i can't let myself get rid of it   stupid   do you have children of your own    no  no  i don't   oh well  you're young  plenty of time   do you want white sugar  you should have white sugar with tea  shouldn't you   don't know what i'm doing with brown sugar   i've had so much tea in the last four days  i think i might change my name to tetley   you did what you thought was right   we know that now   thank you  it wasn't easy  believe me   how do you       erm      sometimes i see people  people who've passed away   can you see carly   we just want to know      can you help us find who did it   i can only tell you what carly tells me   how is mr no self doubt   bristol's answer to norman foster   has he postmodernised the garden shed yet   well  i fancy neoclassical  so  it's a sticking point   what about you  girlfriend   does he know you're meeting up with me    just wondered   don't get your hopes up  robert   hope's a funny thing  sometimes i think we human beings would be a lot better off without it   maybe it's one of the things that makes us human   look  i'm sorry  there's a lot of stuff going on in my life at the moment   you know this little girl who was found       wayne rooney's at it again   where is the waiter with the bloody water    robert   what   what am i supposed to do  jude  what  do you want me there at the birth  too   jude  jude  look      shit   i'm sorry  i'm so sorry    bugger off   just let me apologise  it'll make me feel better   i don't care how you feel  robert  amazing though it may sound   look  come inside and finish your meal   look  it's not a betrayal of josh that i want to have a life again    come on  that's ridiculous      well  that's what you make me feel   every time  and just because i want to see the light at the end of the tunnel and you don't       that's not true   i think you should see someone    talk about it   great  what's to say    my son is dead and i was to blame   it was an accident  robert    i was driving  i was responsible   i loved him  too   you do not have the monopoly on love   children are the worst   'cause they remind you of the grownups that they'll never be   peter pan   lost boys and girls   was she harmed   you know  when you see her   is she harmed looking   no  there isn't a mark on her   but you know that  don't you  are you testing me   god help her   well  if god can't  maybe we can   i don't think that she's going to have peace until her murderer is caught and punished    does anyone else know you're here   no   i mean  my super would have a shit fit   a week ago  so would i   you don't have to apologise for believing  more fool them  more fool      she's here   she's just over there  she's looking right at you     carly  can      can she help us in any way   can she tell us what her attacker looks like   we have to be so gentle  she's still so frightened   erm     she got in the car because he said that he was a friend of her dad's   she didn't think that she was doing anything wrong   it was hot in the car   the heater was on because it was cold outside  but it was hot inside  it was too hot   and there was music playing  she liked the music   what was the music  what kind   he asked her if she liked the music and she said that she did   okay   can she remember anything else  about the car  anything   there was a frog  she liked the frog   the frog was smiling at her    yeah   and then he      and then he      and then he  he      and then      all right  all right  okay   this contains printouts   mug shots of every convicted child sex offender in the bristol area   including those with allegations made against them   um  you'll have     you'll have to leave it with me   okay  okay   call me when you've had a look  yeah       they'll keep each other company  see  kiss for daddy   mr

hard   but you've got to keep your memories of carly when she was alive   and let the dead carly go   i'd never say this in front of your wife   but you realise there's no guarantee that this man they arrested is guilty   i hate to say it    i know how you must feel  but      how could you possibly know how i feel   what alison's offering   it's comfort  yes    but it's not necessarily the truth   the truth   the truth is  she helped us  what have you done     lawyer  your witness for the prosecution  inspector   what were you expecting to do   have her stand up in court and produce ectoplasm in front of the judge    yeah  that's our problem   it is   without dna  without forensic evidence   arresting a man on no more than the lunatic ramblings   of your friendly neighbourhood witch   i don't think she's a lunatic   according to this   alison mundy was sectioned in 2001 under the mental health act  in manchester   i rest my case   now  can my client get on with his life  please   god

brightest coppers in town   i can't believe that you were taken in   by this superstitious voodoo bollocks   i resent that  ma'am   don't try that one  not on me   institutional racism   what about institutional bloody common sense   you've obviously lost your judgement  di george  i hope to god it's temporary   anyway  i've decided we need a fresh eye on the carly tufnell murder   and i'm going to get a new sio from outside the area   so i'm no longer your blue eyed boy  then  ma'am   i didn't even hear that  go   announcer   police in bristol say they have now released a man   interviewed

eliminated from their      i tried   i'm sorry   alison  i'm sorry   felix  please  where are you  felix  felix  you let him go   i can't believe you let him go  after all that we did      i suggest

i've let her down  she's not at peace  she'll never be at peace  not unless we catch him   alison  quiet   go home   i don't understand   there's nothing to understand  go home   i can't believe

  you brought comfort to the family  that's something   you mustn't blame yourself for things that are beyond your control   you're upset  but if you'd asked me  i would have told you   this kind of evidence in a criminal case isn't even going to       don't   well  it's true    what's true  nothing's true   what do you mean   i mean  you're reacting like this exactly because you're in denial yourself   over josh   over his death  over the car crash   right  okay  am i supposed to be impressed because it was in the local newspaper   all you had to do was run a search on my name and bingo   i didn't know  josh told me   right  okay  what else did he say  i'm curious   he's sad   he's here because he doesn't want you to blame yourself   what parent wouldn't blame themselves for the death of a child   you'll have to try harder than that    he hurts because you hurt   no  that's not what i mean   give me one tangible fact that only josh could know  tell me about the crash   what was the other car  was there another car   was i going over the speed limit or under it   well  how would a child know that   all right  describe it  tell me what happened   he doesn't know  it was over in a flash  and he won't talk about it  not to me  anyway   i've had about enough of this   yeah  you see  what you're doing now  that's it  that's denial   i'm a psychologist   i know what denial is  i don't need a spirit medium to define it for me    so what do you need me for  robert   you tell me   oh  you have already  haven't you  to help me talk to my dead son    i was forgetting  i'm not like

you've been spreading nasty rumours about me   if i hear you've been so much as mentioning my name   i'll be back  ringing your bell   that's a threat   i'm sure the police will be very interested to hear that   they're really going to listen to you  aren't they   here   be my guest   night  night  mind the bugs don't bite   kiss for daddy     what can i do   what can i do       hello       i'd come down in the morning   and i'd find her dancing with her mum to      i don't know  the latest hit single on the radio   and she'd go  ''come on  dad  join in  you're boring ''  of course  i never did   she liked angels  fairies  teletubbies  and wearing her mum's high heeled shoes   she had lots of questions about jesus      you'll be pleased to hear   but i don't think he would have any about her   well  she's with him now   like everybody else   i've done one or two things in my life that i'm not particularly proud of   but carly      wasn't one of those   goodbye  sweetheart   your mum
