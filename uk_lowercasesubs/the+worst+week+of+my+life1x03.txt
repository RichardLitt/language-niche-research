accidents   you know  somehow  if there's an intention there we can make sense of it   but    accidents  i mean     the thing is there's no one to blame   it's just a bloody waste of    dog   anyway  as i've got you here i  er  went shopping this morning   and i bought you these   just as small tokens of my respect for you both and my delight  at becoming part of your family     oh  that's    very kind of you  howard    mm   if there's anything i can do to help with the funeral  just say the word   would you mind giving fraser a hand  i don't think he can manage on his own     when did uncle fraser arrive    seven o'clock this morning   that's all i needed  what with binky    why don't we pop your things in the spare room   of course  angela  if it's not you please tell me   and dick  likewise   ohh  perfume  how lovely   jesus christ     what is it    30 flavoured condoms   what   all her favourite flavours  including chicken tikka        hello     howard    yes   fraser  mel's uncle  angela tells me you're lending a hand with the poor mutt   heard a lot about you  fraser  nice to meet you     aaaghh    come on     let's see what you're made of    aaagh     had enough    yes     come on    yes   ow  oh  jesus     once a soldier  always a soldier    oh  that's all right  then     took you by surprise  eh    yes  yes  you did  well done   could've snapped your arm off at the shoulder socket   you never forget sas survival training   could you survive nine days  with no food  in the burmese jungle     probably not    little tip     watch the monkeys   if a monkey eats it  so can you   i'll bear it in mind     next time i'm in the burmese jungle   angela has asked me to say a few words  so     we're all here to say goodbye to binky   so tragically snatched from us by a cement mixer   they say a man's best friend is his dog  but not every dog knows  necessarily  who his friends are   to many of us here  binky was more than just a friend     he was a cherished member of our family   who all have their own fond memories of him     actually i'd better get this  erm    carry on     eve  not a good time    you'll never guess   i was in m   s about an hour ago  buying some mini kievs  and i suddenly remembered a pet shop in kentish town  and there it was   oh  a scottie dog that almost exactly matches little binky   yes   that was eve  got a surprise for your mother     that's nice    so who are all these people   erm    that's jean coop  she bred binky  mrs hodges  mum's cleaning lady   dennis  he does the garden and the two lesbians who run the kennels   everyone you'd expect to see at a dog's wake     and d'you think they all hate me    probably   i keep getting these looks  i think i should say something     howard      sorry to interrupt    'scuse me  sorry   erm  i just thought i should say a few words   i'm howard  mel's fianc  and    erm     first of all i'd like to say how sorry i am that we're meeting in such tragic  but very accidental circumstances   i know that binky meant a lot to you all   to june coop  who bred him and brought old binky into the world   to you two  who saw him happy as larry  as he trotted about the place   and to his two les    erm    lady friends  who     i don't quite know how you two fit in but the point is we'll all miss him  in our own way   and  hey  that's a shame    big shame   erm     well  that's all i wanted to say  really   so  now a toast    er     to binky    binky   you will show me your speech for saturday  won't you   i think this is what he would've wanted   i think he would've wanted not to have been hurled into a cement mixer   yes  point taken     i see you're not wearing your present    what   perhaps you're saving it for saturday  the big day   hope it's not too tight  i  er    i didn't know your size   i got the assistant to try it on   looked about the same size as you   they go on forever  those things  swiss   my father gave me one for my sixteenth birthday     it hasn't let me down once        howard  giles just phoned    oh    good     yeah  he wants to patch things up    bravo   he wants to take me to paris for the weekend  but i'm not sure if i wanna have sex with someone of his age any more   how old is he     erm  i dunno  about your age    oh    i wouldn't write off us more experienced men   i think you'll find what we lack in athleticism we make up for in technique     are you coming on to me again    no  no  no  i'm just saying   in a fulfilling sexual relationship  age shouldn't matter   right  thanks     are you ok  dick    d'you know what he just said to me     who    howard     he asked if i was wearing his present    no   he didn't know if it would fit but the shop assistant was my size  so he got him to try it on  he said it was swiss     swiss    and that he'd had one since he was 16    and it hadn't let him down once    oh  no  there must be some mix up   i didn't know the swiss made condoms     is  erm  angela not joining us   no  she's having a lie down  been an emotional day   you know  in korea they eat dogs     fraser    if we were in korea   binky would in that casserole by now   dick  i don't know if you were listening to local radio earlier  the traffic news   er  those roadworks that we were talking about  outside chertsey  gone     arsehole     sophie     you arsehole    thought we'd established that i wasn't   he said that i should have sex with someone of his age     what    yeah   he said that men of his age have better shagging technique   howard   no  no  i said that age shouldn't matter in a fulfilling sexual relationship     what    not with me   well  thank you  arsehole  i took your advice  again   and i phoned giles  and guess what   he's going to paris with tanya bloody hamilton     dick  i think i should say      talk to him     what    tell giles that he can't dump me     sophie  stop it    but it's his fault     hello    tell him i want to go to paris   howard steel  yes  engaged to mel  that's right     oh  thank you very much    tell him   giles  slightly odd request but sophie's asked me to talk about your relationship   well  strictly speaking it isn't any of my business  but     you couldn't possibly know that because you've never met me   now that's just rude  erm      i'll take this outside   giles     this is absolutely nothing to do with me          giles  hello  giles   no  no  no  giles  you listen to me     hello  hi giles   i'd love to go to paris   you say that  but i'm part of this family now  and i know that dick and angela won't allow their wonderful daughter  to be messed around by some grotty little upstart like you        that's right  matey      giles  just don't see her any more  ok      i am laying down the law   so what you're gonna do is take my sister in law to paris  and give her the time of her life or you'll answer to me   oh  yes  you are  giles  and before you do that  you're gonna pick up the phone and apologise to sophie right now   he just has     ah  sorry to interrupt  old chap  thought i could smell something     i was smoking    didn't know you smoked   i've just started again   jungle training  you see  you often smell the enemy before you hear or see him     really    little tip for you   rub dog's urine all over your body and a chasing dog will ignore the scent     what    yep   you see the dog will think it's himself   yeah  but you'd have to know what dog was gonna chase you   i'm not with you   you'd need a sample of that dog's urine in advance   no  you've lost me   you can't keep a bank of every dog's urine  think of all the dogs   you'd need a bloody warehouse   and then what would be the chances of picking the right sample anyway     it worked for me  take it or leave it      sorry  fraser     ben    great news   friend of mine in the city just gave us 30 of his firm's umbrellas     oh  excellent  well done  mate    so nobody should get wet    and it won't cost you a thing    fantastic news   and howard  thank you so much for the wristwatch     what    the wristwatch  it's magnificent   you should've got the condoms  mel's dad should've got the wris

quiet  then    mm    she had the pick of every single man in london   she had to pick him   i think he really loves her  though  dick   you think of some of her other boyfriends   you didn't like any
