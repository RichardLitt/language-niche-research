and i never wanted    anything from you    except everything you had    and what was left after that too    oh    happiness hit her    like a bullet in the head    struck from a great height    by someone who should know    better than that    the dog days are over    the dog days are done    can you hear the horses     cos here they come           there's somebody coming   alvo's gone away   yes  for the weekend   is there anything wrong   you're hurt   you hurt your arm   oh  yes  erm     too many cervezas  beers     you were fighting   english men abroad  n   you like fighting  yes    n   no   we're looking for a boat   maybe alvo can help n   with our investigation    n   he's where   he's on the mainland   he's on business  back on tuesday   ok   i come back on tuesday   so  what about this boat   we think it was involved n   in bad things    nwhat would alvo know about it   it belongs to jesus milic  n   a serbian property dealer   you know him   you think alvo took the boat   no   anybody who knows him n   will not take his boat    n   unless they're crazy   he's very dangerous     i'm sure it will appear   the island is too small n   for hiding anything   why did you say nhe'd gone to the mainland    nyou know they can check that   cos you are all sitting there n   with your mouths hanging open   we should have told the truth  n   great idea  quinn   not only did we nick a boat  n   but we nicked a boat  from a complete psychopath  n   this is horrendous    nwe get caught up in an investigation   and we're all suspects nin alvo's murder  especially me    n   it does look a little bit weird   four guys just turn up n   out of the blue and       48 hours later alvo's dead  just n   after signing his villa over to us   if we get taken into custody  nthen what  then what    nspanish court case   manjana  manjana   we can explain it  right   if we get done for nicking that boat  nor even as an accessory   we are stuck here on remand nfor months   and if we implicate the police in nthis  that means a federal case    nwe could be stuck here for years   and that's before nwe've even got to court    nfucking hell  this is mental   how do we prove we didn't know n   we were nicking it    n   let's be logical about this   woody  you were the last person n   to speak to alvo  yeah  so    n   did he say anything  about anything  did he give the impression n   he was worried about anything    n   he was banging on about the trip   so you haven't seen him lately   i reckon he planned this   he used us   that's what he said  didn't he  n   said he needed us    n   he needed us to nick that boat   i thought he was saying  n needed us  because     well  you know  nbecause he was in the shit    n   nobody knows we were on the boat   she would have said   there is       my dv camera   it's on the boat  i said to quinn   you said to leave it  didn't you  nhang on a minute   so you're saying that there is nfootage of all of us on that boat    noh  you fucking wanker   baxter  he didn't mean n   to leave the fucking     alright  listen  this is what n   i think we should do   go back to the boat  n   get the camera  clean the boat up   get rid of all the fingerprints n   and then we return it   jesus  n   she said he was a nutter    n   hey  jesus  how you doing  man   bit of a mistake  sorry  n   here's your boat back   by the way  alvo's head n   has been blown off  but no biggy   alright  we can take it somewhere n   where they can find it   n   and tie the fucker up and then     i don't know  we leg it n   and get the hell off the island   this is why we came back this way   can't be seen from the road   can't be seen n   from the front of the villa   i'm telling you  n   alvo knew what he was doing   here you are  you need sunblock   for fuck's sake   fucking thing   i wish i'd never fucking come non this trip in the first place   why did you then  noh  shut the fuck up  fuck off   you wanted to come really  n   didn't you  bax    n   we're still your best pals   trying to recapture something   that's why we came here  isn't it   you know  maybe alvo n   was always crooked    n   we just didn't even know it   nah  doubt that   he's been in the property game  n   hasn't he  since we left college    nyeah  a few dodgy deals  maybe   but i can't see him nas a big criminal somehow   i always think of him n   as the kid at college  who couldn't pronounce n   the word broccoli   there it is   woods  give us the rope   i just remembered  don't touch n   anything unless you have to   let's go   give us a couple of bags  n   this has all gotta go   never gonna find that camera   bloody hell  check out the stereo   i clocked that yesterday   i tell you  some top brand gear   mini laptop   portable dv player   most people get them on the planes   i tell you  the stuff he's got  n   he must be like a multi millionaire   what should we do nwith all these bottles and stuff    n   throw them over the side   where are they going   they're coming towards us   fuck  n   shit    n   down  come on  bax   get down  get down  get down   keep quiet  they might bugger off   you can get up  n   we're not the police    sorry  n   can't any of you read a chart    n   i don't think we have any charts   wankers   listen  lads  n   can i just say something here   you see  this is not actually n   our boat  what   it's a long story  n   but i dropped my camera and    well  who the fuck n   does this belong to then   oh  that ours  yeah   what the fuck are you doing   just thought i'd give you a hand   i thought dominic said n   there would only the one person   you know what he's like   he changes his mind   would you mind putting that down   right   sorry   three mil   as agreed   that's for keeping us waiting   you fuck around like that again n   and you're finished    n   understand   clear   that's it   our lives are over   we're fucked   people don't get away n   with stuff like this   we'll all go to prison   i think       and this is just n   my personal opinion       that it would be a mistake n   to take the boat back    nno shit   i also think       and this is just n   my personal opinion       that if we went to the police n   and told them everything   this might not pan out n   how we wanted to   why don't we just find jesus  n   tell him that we made a mistake    n   we could do that   but we just ripped him off n   to the tune of 3 million euros   a little birdie tells me n   he's not going to sit there quietl  while we try and explain everything  n   you never know   he might be pleased  n   that's right  rick   why do we get some flowers as well n   with a little note    dear jesus  sorry for stealing n   your massive stash of cocaine     n    love rick and the boys    we could     what   nah  it's stupid   go on   we could set the sail       for africa   and then what   live in africa   i've got a life   i've got    responsibilities   hey  i've got kids   yeah  i've got kids   i said it was stupid  n   i'm just trying to     i'm supposed to be playing footie n   on saturday   right  i think there's another way n   but we have to trust each other   look each other in the eye and agree n   that nobody drops anyone in the shit   n   to save their own arse   alvo was mixed up in something big n   but we don't know what that was   we've already had a visit n   from the police and a hitman   but they don't think we're involved  n   what makes you say that   one  they didn't arrest us n   and two  they didn't shoot us   i don't think they know n   what's going on   this is what i think we should do   i think we should n   hide the money somewhere safe   n   'til we're ready to leave   then go back to the villa  n   carry on as normal    n   tuesday we fly back   what we were going to do all along  n   why don't we go now    n   then they'll know we're involved   they'll see we changed our flights  n   and they'll drag us back here    n   this is what i'm saying   if we look like we're on holiday  n   make like alvo's gone away      n     nobody can fucking touch us       you know he said nhe couldn't find the camera    ndo you think he's telling the truth   i mean  maybe he found the camera  nhid the tapes somewhere   nand then chucked the camera   it was his camera  nwhich means he was filming it   so he's not in it  nyeah    nputs him in the clear  doesn't it   what did i just say about us n   having to trust each other   no  i know  i know  ni'm just saying  that's all    nkeep an eye out   oi   somebody nicked his boat n   and half a ton of coke   i don't think he's going to miss n   a dvd player    n   you're fucking nuts   right   we'll wait here n   while you two go back to the villa   well  shouldn't we take the money  n   no    n   why not   because that's the whole point of n   you two going back to get the jeep   what is  in case that copper n   shows up at the villa  or somebody's watching us n   while we have to wait here    n   what happens if she drives past   well  we'll hide the bag then  nwon't we    n   what if someone stops   why would they stop   to offer you a lift   who   a kindly stranger   woody  just fucking go  will you   two tickets to rio  me and you  nwhat do you say   be less of a liability just n   the two of us  that's for sure    ni mean  woody's got a heart of gold   but  let's be honest  neverything he touches turns to shit    nas for rick     he's a fucking menace  n   he's alright    nno  he's not  quinn  he's not   he's out of control  always has been  it's just me  me  me  me with him  nfuck the consequences   yeah  run along you two  n   we'll look after the money    n   patronising fuckers   how many times did quinn look at me  when he was banging on about n   trusting each other   i think he's just a little bit n   worried about you  that's all    n   why   well  you know  since you've n   been here  you've been a bit      n   a bit what   getting pissed n   and shagging that bird    n   so   go to gym and all that shit n   every day now  do you    n   what are you trying to say   bit like an addiction  isn't it   what are you talking about   nothing   just making conversation  woods   first time you cheated on nina   i'm never going to do it again  n   really    n   no  no way  not after last night   why  what did she do   no  it's not that  n   it's alvo  isn't it   because it makes you think you reap n   what you sew and all that shit    n   so you wouldn't do it again  cos it would come round n   and bite you in the arse    n   nothing to do with lovely nina   that's not what i'm saying  n   because i love her  alright    n   i'd never do anything to hurt her   but what she doesn't know  n   it ain't gonna hurt her  is it   you don't think       quinn has said anything  do you   don't know   nah   dunno     ok  tell them what the plan is   right  bax is going to hire a car   we'll hide the money in the boot n   and park it somewhere  where   where's the hardest place n   to find a car    n   car park   make sure no one follows you     murder for a beer   anyone got any euros     did you know that bees can count   scientists in america  they  erm     they set up markers n   between a hive and a feeder   and then they moved the markers n   and the feeder   and they discovered that the bees       find their way n   by counting the markers   gracias   cockroaches  cockroaches  right   cockroaches can live for several n   days without their heads on   rick    n       i'll sit in the front   come on  let's get a move on   just checking the boot's locked   go  go     hey   get out of it   oh     we can't leave him like that   where do you want to take him   i don't know   we need to put him somewhere nhe won't be found    n   i've just had a brilliant idea   please  don't share it   no  no   stick alvo's body n   back on the boat  yeah    n   let the police find it   put two and two together   bingo   drugs deal gone wrong   you know the one thing n   i told nina before i left   i said i wouldn't smoke a cigarette    i told damien this was n   going to be a fairly laid back trip    n   on account of our ages   do you think alvo knew nwhat was on that boat   fuck drugs  n   he was a grafter  wasn't he   he'd sell you his mum  n   but he weren't into that   what about that motorbike courier n   yesterday    n   giving him that package   just before we all went out  n   that was well suspect    nyeah  that was weird   so  so     alvo's on the boat  then what   well     they haven't found him by monday n   evening  we should go to the cops    n   we tell them he's missing   explain that we haven't seen him n   since he left the island and      n     we're concerned for his safety   yeah  say he was upset  n   didn't seem himself    n   exactly   paint a picture  but unfortunately  n   we can't stick around  because we've got a flight booked  n   et cetera  et cetera   it was a fuck of a lot of money nthough  wasn't it   come on  let's have it   if we did have it  n   what would that be each     n   675 000   eeach   he's worked it out already  look   yeah  less the 100 grand n   that bloke took    n   650 000   each   i've been thinking about it   that's at current exchange rates   morally  we haven't done nanything wrong    n   no  we haven't   we didn't ask to go on the boat   we didn't kill alvo   and we didn't know there was going n   to be any drugs on there  did we   we could say we found the money  n   how would we get it back   it would be safer to leave it here  nnot in the car   no  you set up a series n   of offshore accounts    don't be fucking stupid  n   he wasn't being serious   firstly  someone is going n   to come looking for that money   n   sooner rather than later   you don't just let n   three million euros disappear   secondly  we spend any of that n   money  then we are criminals   and thirdly  we'd never n   get away with it  would we   i mean  we're not crooks  n   we're just    four herberts   our phones   our phones are still in that safe   maybe we're just going to have to n   leave them here    n  what are we going to do with him  n   hide him obviously    n   where      spirit in the sky  n  norman greenbaum  oh  shit  n   sorry  alv    n   right  deep freeze in the kitchen   it's huge  there'll be no stink   ok  get him in  we'll stall them     when i die and they lay me to rest    going to go to the place nthat's the best        n   hello   hi   what's going on   stick it in the sink   can we come in   is there

your friend    nme  no  i wish   why  you have problems with money   what  no   why do you say that   your friend  alvo  n   is on the mainland    nyes   where   he didn't say   why   i don't know   but you ask him   yes   no  we didn't ask him  n   it was none of our business    n   what is alvo's business   property  buying and selling   and you  what do you do   i'm a lecturer in psychology   psicologia   so  you know about n   good cop  bad cop    n   sure   which do you think i am   the good cop or the bad cop   did alvo talk about jesus   no   yeah  he mentioned him to me n   a few times    n   hmm     that's not what your friend n   quinn said    n   he said he didn't mention him   well  maybe it was just to me   come to think of it   quinn wasn't in the room n   when he mentioned him to me    n   alone   you have a hire car   sorry   you have rented a car   from the airport   right   so  where is it   i didn't see it outside   we went into town last night   we all got pretty drunk n   so we left it in town   last night  n   you said you had a party    n   in the villa   well  yeah  yeah  we went into n   town first and then came back here    n   so  where is the car   can't remember   will all got really drunk and     would you like us n   to find it for you    n   no  no  that's fine   the boys    i'm sure the lads n   will know where it is    n   we know       alvo was in the uk last month   did you see him then   yes   and you have no job of work n   at the moment    n   so    how do you manage for money   i'm a financial consultant   an accountant   no  not really   i advise   i don't really see what this n   has got to do with    have you ever advised alvo n   on financial issues   i think i should have a lawyer n   present    n   do you want to call a lawyer   please   why do you think you need a lawyer   have you done something   when alvo was in the uk last month  n   he saw your friend mr woods   did he see you too   no   they didn't even mention anything nabout the boat    n   it was all very  sort of  general   yeah  asking stuff like n   when we last saw alvo    n   a month ago  apparently  woody   kept at one quiet   anything else you want to tell us   you have been helpful   when mr alvo returns  n   would you ask him to call me    n   i leave you my card  ok   so    have you any idea nwho killed him then    n
