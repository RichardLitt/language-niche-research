  you're late  and your breath stinks of wine   i may have stopped by the tavern for one small glass to fortify  myself against the night air  how goes things here  is all well   no  all is not well  i nearly died of boredom   twice   finding boredom in one's work is to be relished   it means you are being paid for doing nothing  what could be better   i didn't come to atlantis to be an errand boy for rich merchants   tomorrow  the frankincense will be shipped to helios  and our work guarding it will be done   you won't be so sour faced when you have gold in your purse   a flagon of wine in one hand  and a beautiful woman in the other   two women  you'll need three hands  my friend  ha ha   three hands   you should not be here   i need answers   that i cannot give   the man who was cursed to become the minotaur   he told me that i have a great destiny  what did he mean   the images i see are fleeting   they can be interpreted in many ways   well  then how am i supposed to understand them    you tell me that i was brought to atlantis for a reason   but you cannot tell me what it is   you tell me that my father is dead  but not how or when he died   you say that all will become clear  but what am i supposed to do  until then  i don't understand my place in this world   i don't belong here   but we have waited so many years for your return   what do you want from me   it is not a question of what i want   your destiny is already unfolding before you   how can that be when i feel so lost   it is only when we accept that we are lost that we find our true path   i wish i could make it easier   i will do all i can to help you   why do i sense that you're not telling me the whole truth   because  above anything   i must protect you from those who would do you harm   you must trust in yourself   with time  all will become clear   sophia    ah   urgh   ohh   for the life of me  i cannot understand how it happened   one minute  the frankincense was there  the next  it was gone   you got drunk and fell asleep  didn't you   i'm surprised at you  pythagoras   what would lead you to make such an outrageous accusation   the wine stain on your shirt for a start   and what is that on your cheek   it's dried goat's saliva   oh  you will kiss anything once you've had a few drinks   i wasn't kissing a goat   i wasn't   we can all stand round here  debating whose fault this is     there's no debate  it's your fault   a ha  but is it   yes  completely   or perhaps you will try and blame the goat   it's the merchant  don't answer it   eventually  he'll get bored and go away   look  this is ridiculous   we'll just have to explain that his frankincense was stolen   are you out of your mind  no good has ever come from being honest   i seek the men who slew the minotaur   i came to atlantis   searching for my daughter     demetria   it is many years since i last saw her   i discovered that she'd found work in the palace kitchens   i went to the palace   i was overjoyed at the thought of seeing her   what happened   i was told that my daughter is missing   for three days now  she's not been seen   no one knows what has happened to her   i have heard stories of your heroism in defeating the minotaur   i was hoping you would find my daughter for me   you have undoubtedly come to the right place   our bravery and skills are unrivalled   but such skills do not come cheap   i am not a rich man   i will give you all that i have   as much as it saddens me   unfortunately  on this occasion  we are unable to help you   i know that i'm not long for this world   more than anything i hope that i will die knowing  that my daughter is safe  and happy  and loved   it is my duty as her father   if i fail her       i will take it to my grave   we will do everything we can to help you find your daughter   stay close   we must hurry   korinna   what are you doing   forgive me  my lady  that doesn't answer my question   i'm to blame  a young serving girl is missing  and i promised her father i would find out what had happened to her   it is forbidden for you to be here   you must go before someone sees you   i hope you find her   thank you   this is celandine   she was the last person to see demetria before she disappeared   what more can you tell me   demetria was sent to the forest to gather herbs   that is the last anyone saw of her   did anyone search for her   we are servants   our lives are of little value   can you take me to where demetria would have gone  to gather these herbs  i cannot neglect my duties   i will ensure princess ariadne hears of your kindness   i will meet you by the south gate when i'm finished here   her father will be most grateful for your trouble  as am i   hercules  hercules   what are you doing  it's karpos  the merchant  open up   what are we going to do   we will take the only sensible course of action available to us   i demand you let me in   hercules  come here   hercules     would demetria really have come so far to fetch herbs   our king does not care how far his servants walk to fetch herbs   so long as they are fetched   how much further is it   we're here   these woods are rich with herbs     if you know where to look   is this what happened to demetria   did she die at your hand   where's demetria  what have you done with her   she has not been harmed   her god will comfort and provide for her   where is she   she's in a better place   it's hemlock   the poison would have killed her in moments   why would she take her own life   this engraving     it's a thyrsus   what's a thyrsus   a fennel staff  tipped with a pine cone   is there no limit to your ignorance   the thyrsus is the symbol of the god  dionysus   the cook must have been a maenad   she would rather die than reveal their secrets to you   who are these maenads  they're the female followers of dionysus   they have a temple high in the mountains  in the forest of nysa   it is said to be a magical realm   any man who sets foot there is killed by their satyrs   satyrs  the servants of dionysus   it's said they feed on human flesh   but what would these maenads want with demetria   they take young girls to initiate into the ways of their cult   if the maenads have demetria   then they will be holding her in their temple   and that is a place no man should wish to go   euoe  brachus aion   etoi tauros aion   e fertatos hoste leonton     you desired to know the secrets of our rites   no  please  i was lost   i took the wrong path     our rites will be revealed to you   and you will take them to your grave   no   we must assume that demetria has been initiated  into the cult of dionysus   no  i'm truly sorry   there must be some mistake   i cannot believe that is to be my daughter's fate   it cannot be  i won't allow it   this was not meant to be     i will make an infusion of magnolia and mimulus   it will  at least  soothe him   no  rest  rest  you need to regain your strength   i'm most grateful  you have shown great kindness   i've done nothing but give you bad news   you did all you could   you don't understand what it is to be a father  and know that you will never see your child again   i know what it is to search for someone you love and not find them   you don't even know if she's alive  she could well be dead   and even if she's not dead  she'd be initiated   she'd be more likely to tear you limb from limb   i gave itheus my word that i would try and rescue her   no man has entered the forest of nysa and lived to tell the tale   i will have no part in this madness   why  in the name of the gods  is the old man sleeping in my bed   he is too weak to return to his home   and  as you're not coming with us  you can stay here  and you can look after him  right   not only are you risking your lives for a penniless old man   but you're leaving me to nurse him   am i the only one of us with any sanity left   you are blinded by a foolish sense of duty   but you are blessed to have such an honourable friend   because i have decided  against my better judgment  to accompany you   so  perhaps we should leave by the north gate   hercules  hercules  come out  you thief   you realise karpos will still be after you  when we return to atlantis  if we return to atlantis   so  your cunning plan to avoid paying your debts  is to get yourself killed   that's it  i'm a genius  we fake our own deaths   you cannot collect a debt from a dead man   we could change our names  grow beards     i'm not sure i can even grow a beard   then you're on your own  pythagoras   we can grow beards   big beards   so  this is the forest of nysa   there's no shame in turning back   there's some shame  but i could happily live with that   i've heard stories of the maenads' magical powers   i heard that they have talons for fingers   and eyes as black as the night  and that they bathe in blood   and devour the organs of those they've slain   and i heard that they can draw milk and honey from streams   milk and honey from streams  ridiculous  that's what i heard   we should get some sleep   i'll take first watch   sleep well   hello     wait   i mean you no harm   you have nothing to fear   my name is hercules   you may have heard of me  for i'm well known in these parts   pausai   lord dionysus  accept this offering     erkheo  kai gelasas theresai     shh  you're a maenad  you're one of them   sh  sh  please  please   i have no quarrel with you  i like you maenads   i always have  what are you doing   saving your life   pray that this works  or they will kill us both  thank you   well  the satyrs found him   i drank of his blood and made an offering of him to dionysus   jason   it's hercules  he's gone   what if the maenads have him  what if we're too late   pythagoras  hercules    pythagoras  where are you   why were you up a tree   i was hiding  and then i was sleeping   we thought the maenads had you   they very nearly did   i was keeping watch when i heard a sound from the forest   and then i saw her     who   a beautiful girl  through the trees   i called to her  but she fled   i chased after her   she ran like a gazelie   it was all i could do to keep up with her   i ran  and ran   and then i found her  standing in a clearing  bathed in moonlight   she was clearly terrified   i'm not surprised if you were chasing her through the woods   i assured her that i meant her no harm  i went to comfort her   but then she    what     she turned into one of those monkey creatures   a satyr  you never saw such an ugly beast in your life   i must have been drugged   because then i was surrounded by maenads   they were to make an offering of me  but i was too fast for them   really  yes  really  i ran for my life   i was nearly caught again  but she saved me   who  the girl  i thought you said that she was a satyr   she was  this was another girl   a woman   a vision of beauty   the like of which i have never seen   i owe her my life   how can you be sure that she wasn't a satyr too   i think i can tell the difference between a woman and a monkey   most of the time   it would truly be a sign from the gods  if she was the old man's daughter   you don't know if she's demetria  you don't even know if she's human   i am certain of it  it's the hand of fate   we must rescue her   i don't see any guards  well  they don't need guards  because no one is stupid enough to go in there   speak for yourself   you know  i've never seen him so keen to risk his own life   if this girl turns out to be a satyr   he's going to look truly stupid   it's her  i'm certain of it  hercules  wait   hello  it's me   ah   it turns out it wasn't her   the high priestess wishes to see you   it's her   this is the man who you claim to have made an offering of   how is it he stands before me  i will never be one of you   i would rather die than take part in your rites   you have sinned against your god  it is for dionysus to judge you now   he is not my god   then your death will merely mark the start of your suffering   no  no   please  please  no  no  no   no  take me  not her  you will meet your fate soon enough   no  no  no   jason  no  jason   get behind me   why don't they attack  i don't know   they're afraid of you  who are you  jason   your father sent us to rescue you  my father is long dead   you're not demetria  no  my name is medusa   why do you look at me like that  your name     i thought i'd heard it somewhere before   i should have stopped them   i should have thrown myself into the pit   then you would also be dead   i have seen them tear the flesh from animals and men alike   i have never seen them scared   how long have you been held captive here  it is over ten days now   and how is it you are able to resist the maenads' rites   you're unaffected   it seems you cannot be enchanted by rituals that you cannot hear   how can it be that you live   perhaps your god is not as powerful as you believe   they'll be holding your friends in the cells  we must hurry   you have been a good and loyal friend  pythagoras   you have often been a terrible friend   but i would rather spend my last moments with you than anyone else   jason  i believed you to be dead   and they believed you to be a monkey   i cannot tell you how relieved i am that neither is true   it is thanks to your friend  i owe him my life   i'm alive too   then i hope you've planned a way out of here  we must find demetria   she's been initiated  she will not leave with you   if the girl is happy to stay     i gave her father my word that i would return her to atlantis   surely  with our lives at stake   it's only right that you go back on your word   i'm not leaving this place without her  where can she can be found   i'll take you to her   demetria   your father sent us   we've come to take you back to atlantis   i will never return with you   your father's sick  i'm afraid he's     there's no time for debate  and you're carrying her   they cannot be allowed to escape with knowledge of our sacred rites   i swear  this night   we will honour dionysus with an offering of their blood   thank you  the pleasure's all mine   is she not the most beautiful woman you have ever seen   she's very pretty   ow   is medusa a common name   i don't ever recall meeting anyone with that name  why do you ask   i was just curious   tell me  do you have family in atlantis   no  i was travelling there to seek work when the maenads abducted me   i would be happy to show you the city   what is it   listen   they are hunting us   we'll never out run them  not if we're carrying her   then might i suggest an obvious solution   do not make a sound   argh  shh   demetria   oh   i mean you no harm   you have violated the sanctity of our temple   dionysus demands that you pay with your life   ornsthe   ktanete nin   you should fear me  as they do   i am jason  slayer of the minotaur   demetria is to return to atlantis with me   it is forbidden   then i will slay you as i did the earth bull   i will tear down your temple  and i will scatter your followers to the four winds   i am taking you home to your father   ugh   they cannot harm you now  there is nothing for me in atlantis   your father is dying  he wants more than anything  just to look on you and to know that you are safe   no   and what of your father   he is already dead to me   lissometh' o dionse fanemenai  ommasin hemon     o thgater pontu  s'iskhei nn moira krataie   what did she say   i don't know   i think she cursed you   you have returned   demetria   she is with you   no   you have found her   where is she   your daughter     your daughter is in helios   you know demetria  you know her   jason and his friends rescued us   demetria has gone to helios to be with a boy   she wanted more than anything to return to atlantis     to be with you   but she has a new life in helios   she is happy   she is in love   then i will find peace in the afterlife   i am deeply indebted to you   you owe me nothing   all that i have in this world       is yours   demetria asked me to care for you in her place   you told me the path i choose to follow would become clear   now  i'm more confused than ever   i was unable to save demetria   i failed   you believed that the path you were following  would lead to one girl   and yet you found another   perhaps that was your true purpose   from my time in the other world   there were stories of someone named medusa   what is to become of her   i believe you already know the answer to that question   she has done no wrong   i will not see her harmed   medusa can no more escape her destiny than you can escape yours   her fate is inextricably bound to your own   i don't understand   why is my destiny so important   because the fate of all of atlantis rests in your hands   why   why me   for the same reason that the satyrs did not attack you   you're not like other men   you will realise that soon enough   it is poseidon you have wronged   as such  you have been called before the bulls
