  what's that   see a client without a solicitor's rep present     why not    protection   in case a difficult client wants to say you've given bad advice     barristers can be sued now  even baby

years old   which makes this  well  a bad  bad thing   which is why it matters that the right man goes down for it   one big question   can a terrified 85 year old be relied upon  to identify his balaclava'd attacker correctly     are you here for gary    yes     ds scarrow    thank you   word of advice  don't be alone with him   you don't intimidate me   i'm concerned for your safety  that's

when's the baby due    eight weeks   do you know what would have happened  if the condoms had broken open inside of you     you'll die    and your baby   i know     you've got children already    yes     how many    five   how old are you   twenty six   and how old were you when your first child was born   seventeen   is there anything you want to say about your co defendant   what about the people who asked you to carry the drugs   no   if you plead guilty now  you'll get maximum credit   which means about a third or a quarter of your sentence   you know that whatever sentence you do get  will be too long for the baby to stay with you in prison   you don't have to plead guilty now   but this judge is all right   and you might not get the same judge next time   i understand   martha  okay   okay  i need you to sign the front of my brief   this just makes clear that i have not put any pressure on you   do you understand   okay   just there     you're on  let's go   okay     how old are you    thirty five   how long have you been 35   couple of years     is it hard to get silk    everything changes   you get to choose your cases  take time off when you want to   ask leading questions and get away with it   i'm from camp frogett for the rush trial     oh  where the hell have you been    i had a casting   i'm an actor  this is what i do when i'm not working     what was the casting for    head and shoulders   the shampoo giant     thanks  mate     oh  there  yes    pleading   who's that   two new pupils in chambers   billy gave me first choice  so i plumped for the girl   ah  did you  really   on what basis   on the basis that she's got a really useful brain   nick slade   oh  right  you're the other one   the other one   sorry  that came out a bit wrong   i'm the other new pupil  niamh   well  shouldn't we shake hands or something   oh  barristers don't shake hands  it's kind of a rule     right      how do you know that   father's a judge   oh  right   usher  all rise   billy said this judge might be a reference for my silk application     he said that to me  too    we can't both ask him   let's see how we go  shall we   mercedes cordoba is poor   she comes from ciudad bol var in bogot   which means her poverty is extreme   she was classically vulnerable to the approach from the drug cartel   who exploited her with the offer of money  for travelling on a hot flight to london with drugs in her belly   she has shown great courage in pleading guilty   she knows that she will lose her baby into care   and we can only imagine how hopeless her situation must be  to agree to swallowing condoms filled with cocaine   knowing the damage they could cause to you and your baby   mercedes cordoba is not heartless   not evil   she's just desperate   she will pay for what she's done  she knows that   but i ask your honour to pass a sentence  which reflects her sad life and gives her the hope for a better one   do you want to address me on the relative status positions  of the two defendants   i think it's already there in everything i've said  your honour   judge  mr  reader   i'm surprised that my learned friend has chosen not to talk about  where her client is in the hierarchy compared with mine   your honour has seen the notices of additional evidence   mercedes cordoba is an experienced trafficker   she uses her repeated pregnancies to throw off customs   what she didn't know was that she was being watched by customs  over a period of years   she's pregnant every time she travels   it's her protection against being stopped   nuns  girl guides  pregnant women  they just get waved through   now  angel valera  my client  is the driver   he met her at the airport   there's no evidence that he's ever done anything like this before   he's at the bottom of the ladder  in terms of his position in the hierarchy   a good many rungs below that of his cunning  pregnant co defendant   no second bite of the cherry  miss costello   stand up  both of you   i have to establish in my own mind where each of you stands  in the ranks of this evil organisation that brings misery into our country   i have no doubt that you  mercedes cordoba   are a good way up it  whatever your counsel says   you'll go to prison for 14 years   angel valera  you have the dubious good fortune  to be a long way down the pecking order in this obscene organisation   and i have to reflect that in your sentence   you will go to prison for eight years   take them down   usher  all rise     i'll be down at lunchtime to see you    okay  okay   lunchtime   you set me up  you bastard   what was i supposed to do  tell you in advance   you knew you were going to cut my throat   doing my job  representing my client   reading the brief   don't take it personally  martha   where would we all be if we took things personally   don't patronise me   why not  you're behaving like a child   you clearly hadn't read the naes   let me guess  still at home   in an unopened file lying on the floor somewhere   you didn't do your job properly  you know it  that's why you're cross   she's just got 14 years  for god's sake   whose fault's that   where are you going   to ask the judge for a reference   no  of course i don't take things personally   woman   will miss costello and counsel       what    no   what       billy  hello    billy  the drugs mules   i got eight  she got 14     reference  sir    reference to die for  i think   very good  sir    ever   out of tens of thousands   now  boys  you've got to respect a statistic like that  huh   and it's still 12 male qcs to every doris   i mean  what are the odds  jake  hmm   i've got no record of that payment coming in whatsoever   kind of you to grace us with your presence  miss costello   i'm sorry  my lord  i was detained in another court   nice little earner before the main act   ah  about  90  minus clerks' fees  chambers rent  travel tax  vat   so  that leaves about  12 50  so  not much of an earner  really   but entirely my fault i'm late   good result yesterday   against the odds   ah  the jury's always right   let's swear one in  shall we   actually  i haven't had a chance to speak to the defendant   five minutes   a little longer   four and a half and counting   just confirm for me 100  you weren't there   you've never been there   it wasn't you   look  yes or no   it wasn't me   you didn't do this   so he was mistaken when he picked you out in a video id   look  i know what you're doing   you're up against it  you're out of your depth   so you're leaning on me to plead guilty   i don't do that   you tell me you didn't do this  and i will fight for you   what time did you get this brief   late last night   we all perform better under pressure   judge ladd  take as much time as you need  mr  dodd   dodd  he hit me three times   every three minutes he'd just walk over to me  tied up in me chair   and punch me in the face   wasn't in any hurry   have you been able to establish what was stolen   my late wife's jewellery   my wedding ring   i can't wear it any more 'cause of this arthritis    55 in a drawer  uh  my watch   my distinguished conduct medal   he stole my medal   kate  how did you win the medal  dodd  normandy   the night of june the 4th  1944   we dropped in to occupied france  ahead of the beach landings and i     i  uh    brought a wounded comrade in   kate  how much time did you get to look at the intruder   thirteen minutes   how are you able to be so precise   there was a clock on the wall   the police like to know about the time of everything  don't they   so  i thought i should keep an eye on it   what was the intruder wearing   he had a motorcycle helmet on  then he took it off   he had a sort of balaclava on underneath   like the ones the formula one drivers wear under their helmets   and he kept that on   five minute break   usher  all rise     lots of form for burglary    yes     so  that's      yes  nick   so  just because he's done this kind of thing before   it doesn't make him guilty this time   innocent until proven guilty   four words to live by   what do you think     it'll happen to you    what will   well  all defence counsels know when a defendant's guilty   but when halfway through a trial  they always forget   man      in the case of rush please go to court one   martha  how good is your eyesight  dodd  it's fine   you attended an id procedure at the police station   and during that procedure   you made a request to sit nearer to the screen   i wanted to look at the eyes   the shape  the colour   when he was in the flat  i thought    you're good  you're not giving me anything here    but for one thing  your eyes    i'm going to get you on that    you pride yourself on being sprightly for your age   well     you might not be very good at admitting  that your faculties are working less well now than they were   you're raging against the dying of the light   my light is not dying  miss costello   that was the man in my flat and i'm not mistaken about it   how's your hearing  mr  dodd   oh  he didn't speak  not once   really   will you look at your witness statement   it's three lines from the bottom of the second page     what does it say    it says      the intruder had no particular accent    well  you've just told this jury that he didn't speak  mr  dodd   so  how do you know what accent the intruder actually had   he hummed   the whole time he was in my flat   he only stopped humming when he was hitting me   well  is that in your witness statement   no   the whole point of a witness statement  is to tell the whole truth to the police  isn't it   so  why didn't you mention he was humming   i didn't want him to seem like he was mad   beg your pardon   i'd like him to go to a proper prison   oh  i see  so  no soft option for the man you believe did this to you   i don't want him going into a home for the mentally ill   martha  the police have made an arrest   and you've assumed they've got the right man  yeah   and now  you want to make sure he's convicted  and above all  punished   is this a question or a speech  miss costello   this defendant wasn't there   you've got the wrong man  mr  dodd   my wife died in a home for the mentally ill   she had to wear nappies at the end   when she died  her nappy hadn't been changed for three days   i wanted to do it for her  but she wouldn't let me    you're my husband   she said   the last time i visited her   there was a new sign up in the room  where they sat to watch the television in   it said   no dancing    i wouldn't wish that on anyone   not even my worst enemy   judge ladd  lunch   is she coming   you okay   how do you mean   um     emotional detachment  any barrister worth their salt has it   like you     this afternoon      i'm really busy  nick     does sir know his head size     hmm    shall we find out   oh  yeah   and shall we say two spare collars   six bands and a dozen studs   great     how much    1 759 plus vat     do you do secondhand    yes  sir     are wigs from dead barristers    yes  sir   well  could i look at the secondhand  then  please     a strange man in your flat  in a balaclava in the middle of the night   you must have been terrified   well  i was scared  but i didn't want him to know that   and he hit you  didn't he   yes   three times   i tried very hard to look at him   each time he hit me  i tried to look at him   show him he wasn't winning   you've been incredibly precise  about the actions of the intruder inside your flat   three minutes between each time he hit you   well  it's funny  but making myself focus  exactly on what he was doing  i think it helped   i mean  it stopped me from being quite so frightened   you were in the parachute regiment during the war   yes   tell us about jumping out of aeroplanes at night under fire   well  you just do it   wait for the light   one alligator  two alligator  three alligator     go      some people do crocodiles  i do alligators   so you know about thinking straight under pressure   well  i suppose so     he was wearing gloves    yes     did he cough    no     sneeze    no     scratch his nose    no   judge ladd  relevance  miss costello   i'm struggling  i'm sure the jury are   he yawned   just as he was leaving  he     stood at the door looking at me  and he yawned   then he put his hand up to cover his mouth   i thought   how strange    a burglar with no emotion but very good manners   then he put his hand on the door handle   looked at me   opened the door  and walked out   what do you think   that yawn put about another year on his sentence     how's it going    should have got a secondhand one   virgin white wig makes you look like you don't know what you're doing   well  actually  i nicked it   very funny   where the hell is my barrister   where's my brief  i'm going to get sent down for this  you     who do you want first   can i do gary rush for two minutes and then mercedes cordoba   you know  i don't think you know what you're doing   i'm going to get you off       mercedes cordoba    your client's gone   what   i told you i was going to be

of judges  and all the solicitors we're supposed to suck up to   and we do lots of sucking up   touting or tarting party   first impressions  nick   make them like you     is there a vo for a legal visit   mercedes cordoba   why not   you should have received a request for one   look  she's pregnant  she's vulnerable  and she's about to start a 14 year sentence tonight   i need to see her     hello      hello   excuse me   ah   brian frogett  senior partner from camp frogett   rang to remind us he's too important to come to this kind of do   but he says he's making an exception  because he heard about your performance today   and he'd like to meet you     what kind of question was that     sorry    oh  what  you've forgotten   about the worst question asked of anyone in the witness box ever    i know  let's see if the burglar yawned  shall we    tell me  did he yawn at all after beating the crap out of you      you don't understand that      aggravated doesn't cover it  does it   we're going to have to invent a new term for this   how about psychopath burglary  will that do it     who told you    another stupid question  peter told me   or was he wrong   i told you   you don't understand   and  uh     who's peter   the outdoor clerk who's been with you all day   hardly   he spent most of his day at a casting or on the phone to his agent   maybe if you had an outdoor clerk who knew how to read a trial properly     was it him asking the suicidal questions  or was that the brainless woman in the wig   i think you'd better leave   what did you just say   no one ever talks to her like that   excuse me   excuse me   jake  clear this up  please  clear this up   get this cleared up  boys   it's called unconditional love  i'd do the same for any one of you   can be a

the wrong result    you make me sick   was it the wrong result   now  maybe you're just getting too close sometimes  martha   what are you doing     what the hell are you doing    i'm calling the police   give me the phone   just give me the phone  give me the phone     what's going on    who are you     give her the phone    who the hell are you   give her the phone back         martha  jake

aren't i    no  i promise you  you're not   we'll work on it   here  take a cab home   i'm going to look at the unused   now you're impressing me   thank you       what do you want   oh  i was just    i was just working   uh  but now i'm     i'm going   i'm martha costello's new pupil   your her knight in shining armour  by all accounts   she's great  isn't she   yes   um  are you all right   i'm fine   look  can i ask you a question     mmm hmm    do you think she'll get silk   yes   see you     one alligator  two alligator  three alligator  four     one alligator  two alligator   three alligator  four alligator  five alligator     hello   get over here  no   there is no one else  must be you   right  what have you got for me   you've never met gary rush     no    watch this     why am i      just watch it   the defendant may or may not be present in the dvd you're watching     which one is he   four  it's number four     why    i don't know   phoebe  i come in three times a day   i help mr  dodd to get dressed in the morning   i give him his lunch and then i help him to get to bed at night   and when you left him that evening  he was in bed    and everything was as it should be    yes   uh  no questions   actually  sorry  sorry     did you close the door behind you   yes  of course   thank you   the defendant lives a short distance away from the scene of the crime  and you arrested him because there's cctv footage of a man on a vespa  leaving from outside mr  dodd's home address  just after the burglary took place   the defendant owns a vespa   the footage isn't good enough for us to identify it 100  but     grounds for suspicion  grounds for arrest   yeah   was any of the stolen property    recovered from the defendant's flat    no   any paraphernalia associated with burglary   these things are easily disposed of   stick to the evidence  officer  not supposition   it's supposition based on 25 years of experience   then came the id parade and slam dunk   you haven't been in court until now   so you won't know what mr  dodd said in the witness box   but you will have heard about the  yawn moment    it's    it's chilling   to torture an old man and then yawn   well  was he bored  tired   and this is the kind of behaviour you'd expect from this defendant   do you have any idea what you're doing  miss costello   is it right that this defendant has previous convictions   including three previous convictions for burglary     yes    and  well   can you tell us about the sentences mr  rush received for those offences   probation the first time   the second time   followed by six months in prison   in 25 years of experience   how do you feel about those sentences   too short   in 25 years of experience  if a man yawns  and puts his gloved hand up to his mouth   then with the same hand opens the door using the handle   what will we find on the handle   dna  where is it   who was the first officer to arrive on the scene of the crime     i was    and this was before socos   long before forensics had got to the flat   when the door handle was tested  were any fingerprints found   no   so    none   a door handle with nobody's prints on it   not mr  dodd's  not the social worker from an hour before   see  mr  dodd couldn't have been clearer    the intruder yawned    he put his gloved hand up to his face to cover his yawn    he opened the door with the same hand using the handle    gather up all your experience  officer   bring it to the front of your mind and park it next to your anger  and tell this jury that someone didn't wipe the handle clean  before it was tested     you fitted up this defendant because you don't like him   he's got form  and in your policeman's mind   he hasn't been properly punished   so how did mr  dodd pick him out  then  eh   if it wasn't him   one alligator  two alligator   three alligator  four alligator   one alligator  two alligator  three alligator   four alligator  five alligator  six   that was something  that was     that was really something   martha  you've seen the dvd of the id procedure   you've heard the victim count  in his very own  very particular   very precise way   the fact that gary rush is on that screen for two seconds   or alligators  longer than everyone else   you've seen the black screen either side of only one image on that video   the only evidence this prosecution relies on  is mr  dodd picking out the defendant on an id parade   not only is there no forensic evidence   there's evidence of there being no forensic evidence   which  frankly  is impossible   if gary rush was in that flat and he yawned   then his dna would be on that door handle   is it safe to convict this man  on this evidence   you as a jury have a sacred task   it is your job to apply the one basic principle  on which everything in our justice system turns   the prosecution have to prove beyond all reasonable doubt  that a defendant is guilty   go back to your jury room  and apply that principle to these facts  and come back with the only proper verdict   gary rush is not guilty     three convictions for burglary    we've had this conversation   but obviously his acquittal last year for another burglary  isn't on the list of previous  but it is in the unused   that's because it's an acquittal  nick   or because the victim was punched three times in the head  and bawled out of giving evidence at the last minute   what does that tell you   that ds scarrow has a classic motive for fitting up gary rush   that he walked into this crime  and removed any possibility from his mind  that rush might not be the right man   it's about integrity of justice  nick   it's about people getting a fair trial   and that's all there is   and it matters so much   man  miss costello   verdict   usher  will the defendant please stand   usher  will the foreman please stand   have you reached a verdict upon which all of you are agreed   foreman  yes   do you find the defendant guilty or not guilty of aggravated burglary   not guilty   yes   these two things are true   gary rush is a horrible man   and it's right that he gets off   they're not mutually exclusive   let's go and see mercedes cordoba   come on   they raped me   every time   several men   always all of them   so that when i was pregnant   they wouldn't know who the father was   when my belly grew bigger   they made me swallow the drugs  and i flew to london   where are your children   every time the baby was born   they took the baby away   three boys   two girls   then they raped me again   i don't know where my babies are   why didn't you tell me this   i could have used it   i wanted a long sentence   here  i'm safe   i'm away from them   there is a ground for appeal   why can't you hear me   i do not want an appeal   thank you   what was the ground for appeal   me  me being hopeless   gary rush doesn't think you're hopeless     who delivered this    bike     did he take his helmet off    no  why  miss   twenty years since i delivered a brief by hand   kidnapping  at the bailey tomorrow   there you go  miss  gary rush is a free man   you've prevented a miscarriage of justice   camp frogett love you   a day in the life of martha costello   nick  forget trials and rules of evidence  and conviction rates and whatever   women do invent rapes that never happened   win a rape trial in front of the most influential judge  in the southeastern circuit and you go straight to silk     do not pass go    what makes you think it's winnable     what are my chances    fifty fifty   clive  but if i had to choose anyone to cross examine you   it would be martha costello   she won't go for you  her heart isn't in it   say hello to martha costello  tell her she's the girl for me   there will be nothing on that medal to link gary rush to it   so  you do nothing   martha  hello   kate  we need to modernise   but billy     we're not sure how he fits in   never underestimate what i know  john   i'm your client  and i need more from you than you're giving   i'm telling the truth   you're the liar here  not me
