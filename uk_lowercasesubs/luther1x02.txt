home   i still love you  zoe  you care more about the dead than the living   that's where your heart is   do you love him   just leave her alone  right    mobile rings  hello  john  alice  you may be very  very clever   but you're wrong  there is love in the world   so you lose   lima sierra 219 to control  confirm  we do have a white male down   mid 20s  possible gun shot wounds  over   'received  lima sierra 219  ambulance en route   'eta four minutes  over '  gunshots  gunshot  gunshot    love is like a sin  my love    for the ones that feel it the most    look at her with her eyes like a flame    she will love you like a fly    will never love you again     'thank you for coming in so early   'as you know  dci luther is facing a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm   'these are matters we take very seriously indeed '  but i need to know from you  mr north  without prejudice  exactly what happened yesterday   did dci luther assault you   look  er  the truth is     dci luther was defending himself   i'm not proud to tell you this  but i threw the first punch   and  er  quite honestly  i thought the police were heavy handed   'i will ask you to sign a statement to this effect '  'that's why i'm here '  mobile rings  'this is dci john luther  leave a message '  i know how hard that was for you   i'm fine   i might work from home today  though   thank you   you might want to try answering your phone   get a reputation for answering phones and all they do is ring   you spoken to zoe   no   then  you should know that mark north gave you a pass   he's not pressing charges   so how about we finish this chat away from the edge   d'you never do this   come up to a really high place and wonder what it would be like  just to fall  fall or jump   same thing  i beg to differ   but  mostly i go home  watch america's next top model   don't you worry you're on the devil's side without even knowing   no   just let it go  john  i already let him go   just didn't finish the job off properly  did i   and nobody shed a tear  that doesn't make it right   makes it a little bit less wrong  though   so  you going to jump   probably not   well  then i'm bored of this game   you going back to the factory   i've been on 18 hours straight  i'm going home  mate  you should try it   i might   mobile beeps  or i might not   this is mike eppley   over here  this is steve gorman   yeah   you knew them  a little bit   sorry  don't be sorry   if you see gorman and eppley  you go blind  see the scene   tell me what you see   right  well  gorman was shot at close range     double tap to the chest   entry wounds are two  three inches apart   that's good shooting  that is   and this blood here  it's real but it won't be the shooter's   it looks staged  to me   staged  look  look  look   this is an execution   it can't be  the shooter wouldn't know they'd attend this call out   no  i didn't say he was targeting gorman and eppley   i said it was an execution   i don't understand what that means   nor do i  excuse me  bag that   grab that  thank you   all right   morning  corinne   any suspects  john  off the record   you've got my number  yeah memorised  six  six  six   direct line   anything  er  yeah  could be   cobden lane links northlight road and stockwood hill  yeah   less than three minutes after the shooting  this man crossed the road  is that it   well  we're lucky to get that  yeah  where does he go   ducks behind shops on hamilton row  behind that  there's another lane   gives out onto allotments  gardens  a canal  no more cctv   coverage is spotty at best   plus  most cameras in the area have been vandalised  vandalised  when   er  well  four were reported down     four went down monday night   yeah  the shooter would have tooken them out  wouldn't he   all right  so we need to review the footage going back seven days  before the sabotage  see if we can't find our man on his recce   can i hear that 999 call again   yeah   'there's been a shooting  a man's lying face down at the northlight end of cobden lane '  yeah  listen to that  that's a very efficient call   no ambiguity  just essential information   people leaving crime scenes  yeah   they hunch  look at the ground  avoid eye contact   look at him  straight back  square shoulders   he's alert  he's calm  he's aware of his surroundings   i bet you any money  he's armed forces   what  you get that from this   you ever been in a pub  bar  whatever and you know   you just know the guy next to you is a copper   yeah  sometimes  yeah  well  i grew up around soldiers   the way he walks  talks  shoots   that's a soldier   all right  so we need to look up army personnel  that have suffered at the hands of the police   dig up aggravated arrest complaints filed by veterans on behalf of  themselves  friends  family  all right  it'll be a long list   soldiers back from war don't find it easy   they get depressed  they drink  they fight  they get arrested   this was an execution   i'm not saying the assassin was targeting gorman and eppley   but i'm saying  what if he was targeting their uniforms   mobile rings hm   right  i get it  i'm on it   what do you want   'i've been reading bertrand russell to a friend of yours '   often  the good suffer  and the wicked prosper    and one hardly knows which of those is the more annoying    what are you talking about  where  where are you   if only he could speak  what tales he could tell   what are you playing at  alice   i'm investigating you  i don't know what that means   what it means  i am curious about how henry came to be here like this   well  there's no need to be curious   he killed children  he tried to run away  i caught him   he fell  and who actually believes that   everyone that matters   zoe  for example   yes   because do you know what i think   i can't imagine  'i think you gave in to your true nature   'just for a second and let him fall '  and you couldn't take it  you gave in to guilt and self loathing   how am i doing   not so well  'but mostly  you were terrified that zoe might'  discover what you'd done and learn what kind of man you actually are   you don't know anything about me  let alone my marriage   well  i can always ask her myself  see what she says   alice  i know this is just a sport to you but you need to stop   just stop   don't go anywhere near zoe  anywhere near her   and don't say a word about this to anyone  do you understand me   why  exactly  are you scared of what i'll find out or what she will   hey  have we got anything   half a dozen names hit key markers   mostly drunk and disorderly  aggravated assault   but i'm thinking   nah  it's not enough for our boy    broaden the search parameters   veterans from the first gulf war  northern ireland   falklands    he's in there somewhere   'police say the killer is armed and extremely dangerous '  members of the public who see him  should not attempt to apprehend him   but immediately dial 999  police  at present   are refusing to comment on a possible motive for the murders   but re assure the public that they are doing everything possible     terry lynch  ex 46 commando  royal marines   decorated veteran   officer while resisting arrest   i remember this  dennis sorrel  decent bloke   lynch was in a bar  got into an argument   sorrel was the first responder  tried to calm things down   lynch glassed him  sorrel bled out  yeah   and lynch pleaded  combat stress    that's maybe not so mad as it sounds   about 10  of the prison population is comprised of veterans    i don't care what he did at goose green  desert storm   operation enduring freedom   it doesn't give him a free pass to kill coppers   anyway  he can't be our man  he's inside    life without possibility    well  this is his son  owen lynch   also 46 commando  returned from afghanistan last year   forced to leave under  administrative discharge    which means he had mental health issues   army left him high and dry  got an address   statement from his wife  rachel   she threw him out   the man who came back wasn't the man who left    he's taken it out on her once too often  she's thrown him out   that was the last time he was on the radar   until gorman and eppley last night    gorman and eppley had nothing to do with his father being sent down  no   is this as bad as it sounds   yeah  false alarm  prank call  that's me done for the day   put the kettle on  over   boss  we've got another officer down  harthill estate   come on   sirens blare  where was the shooter   he turned the corner into the street down here   he just walked right up and shot her  point blank  in the abdomen   this isn't right  sir   well  last night  he fires four perfect shots in the dark   today  in broad daylight  he messes up and leaves hanson alive   that's not right   it's not right  it's not right   oh  no   everyone  take cover   'after an unprecedented six fatalities in less than 24 hours   'there is a sense on the streets of london  'that the police presence is being greatly reduced  'in response to these killings   'despite the metropolitan police's strident denials   'can the emergency services afford to maintain their 999  'response commitment to ordinary people of the capital   'this is corinne day  bbc news  london '  you all right  'thank you  corinne  and now to other news ' yeah   no  i've never been shot at before   you know  there's people you can speak to these days   if you need to   what  like a counsellor   yeah  why not   if my dad knew if i'd seen a counsellor  he'd shoot me himself   all right  everyone  roll up  roll up   orders from on high   all personnel will be issued with bullet proof vests  where available   now  i know  where available  isn't what you want to hear   but it's the best we can do  there we go   any questions   good   now  this has been a bad day   the worst day most of us have seen on the job   looking around  i'm reminded that many of us are old fossils  with quite a few bad days behind us    so  what we're going to do  ladies and gents  is sniff out this bastard   then show him and the rest of the world that no one can do this to us   so  let's get out there and get him   let's have it  then   my name is owen lynch  ex 46 commando  royal marines   this is my dad    terry lynch   also 46 commando  royal marines   he was at bluff cove when they shot down an argentine jet using rifles   after that  he did two tours in county armagh   his final tour was in the helmand province   last year  he went to prison for a crime that would never have been  committed if this country had given him the respect that he deserved   but that doesn't happen   more men who served in the falklands have committed suicide since  than died in the war itself   that may soon be true of men serving in iraq and afghanistan   my dad was defending himself from a belligerent arrest   he shouldn't be in prison for murder   police officers will continue to die until justice is done   no negotiations will be entered into  and there will be no further communication from me   freedom for terry lynch   luther sighs  how many views so far    all major news media outlets have picked up on it   it's out there  it's not coming back   he hardly mentions himself   does that not strike you as weird   i mean  he's just got back from the war   his life's in shreds  but this whole declaration's about what  his dad's done and what his dad's achieved  where his dad served   find out whether owen's visited terry lynch in prison  sir   mobile rings  er  i've got to get this   'stop stalking me  alice  you're yesterday's news '  yes  i heard about the dead policemen   i was worried about you  john   about what  that someone else might get me   i know how hard men like you take the death of fellow officers   it must be like losing family   i'm not discussing cases with you   not even interesting ones   this isn't  interesting    these are good cops doing good jobs   being gunned down on the streets  like    like what   that's something we all do  in the end    judge who's worth more than whom   hitler or ghandi   the very young  the very old   but to be fair most of us don't do it to the extent that you do   but it does mean the difference between us is one of degree   not category  ask henry madsen  all right  you win  ok   you're too clever for me  alice   flattery to appease a malignant narcissist   a frivolous tactic   are you afraid of me   yes  why  you know why  do you want me to leave you alone   yes  i do  then answer my questions  why  to help with my investigation   i've got means  opportunity   you still haven't given me motive  why did you let henry madsen fall   i can't say what you want to hear  ok   do you think zoe could clarify the situation for me   you shoved a knife in her ear  so i think she'll be disinclined to chat   it wasn't a knife and i wasn't asking permission   and believe me  if i pay her a visit  she'll talk   oi  listen  i don't respond well to threats   hmm  i think coffee  do you want some   tea  tea   phone rings  is it john   john   have you got a minute  not to argue  i don't   no  just  er  i want to ask you something   erm  i need you to leave london   not for long  just a few days   go to your mum and dad's or  erm  mark's parents  whatever   what's wrong  why  i've received a viable threat   what kind of a threat  from alice morgan   he's playing mind games  it's a control thing   he wants to control you  he always did  you don't know him   it's pathetic  what is he going to do next   he's going to bang you on the head  drag you to a cave by the hair   do you like this kind of thing  this controlling  macho bullshit   i can't believe you're being so childish about this   i can't believe you let this man turn you into such an arsehole   he received a threat  says him   oh  come on  we're not interrogating your masculinity here   we don't have to worry about that  i'm secure enough  to weather any comparison you care to make with your ex husband   of course you are  and you shouldn't be questioning my motives   it's just    look  john knows this stuff  and if he thinks we should leave   i honestly think we should take him seriously   do you know what i think  what  this last half hour wasn't it   you know what i think   if there was a threat  a genuine threat to your safety   there would already be a security detail outside the door   zoe  the police look after their own  he's lying   i don't know why he's lying  but he's lying   that's really not fair   well  a simple solution   why don't we just pick up the phone and dial his boss   see what she thinks about this threat   i got what you wanted  footage from the prison   ok  you're looking at owen lynch's most recent visit to his dad   just over two weeks ago  er  no audio  of course   no hugs  no smiles   owen's nervous  whatever terry's saying   owen's finding it profoundly stressful   when did terry lose his appeal  about a month ago   so this is what  two weeks ago  yeah   do you know what we're looking at   we're looking at owen receiving his orders   crikey   don't tell me   i've got a visitor   gotcha   right  you brief john  i'll trace this number   two schoolgirls are coming home from sunday school one day  and one turns to the other and says   do you believe in the devil    the other one says   don't be silly  of course not    the devil's like santa    it's only your dad   ha ha ha   i always thought that was funny   the thing is about little boys is that  they worship their dads like gods   the more invisible he is   the more arbitrary in his punishment and rewards   the more they crave his approval   i know what it must be like for owen  my dad was a soldier   first armoured division  seventh armoured brigade   so  germany  mostly   canada  little bit of cyprus   i bet your old man was a right old hard bastard  weren't he   well  see it was tough for him  you see  cos here i am  a big lad   eager to please   wanting to care about the things he cared about   army  sports   no  there was nothing   he wanted me to box   i just wanted to read books  write  meet girls   in the end  i just gave up trying to make him proud   cos i just knew it was never going to happen   but this daft bastard  he hasn't given up  though  has he   more than anything  he just wants to make his dad proud   i tell you   i know you gave him a job to do   but i don't think you quite appreciate the implications   in crimes like this  half the offenders end up  shooting themselves in the face  the others get shot by police   your boy's going to die  unless you help him   oh  yeah   by doing what   go on camera  tell him to stop  rescind the order   all right  i could do that  yeah   but  a reduction in sentence   that's not going to happen  terry  you killed a police officer   i'm not asking for a pardon  i'm asking for a reduction   you know  i got life for murder   should've been five for manslaughter  with diminished   now  i'll take that  with time served   even if there was a precedent  there'd be no time   i don't know about that  cos owen can look after himself  can't he   he could be out there for weeks  mate  before you catch him   weeks and weeks    this is your son we're talking about   and you're sitting in here  killing him  not if you give me what i want   you're not getting what you want   five years with time served and transfer to an open prison   now  if you can do that for me   you can come back and you can bring  all the cameras that you want   boss  we've triangulated the signal   static  mobile  no movement  he's keeping his head down   sensible boy   this is teller  we've got a possible location for owen lynch   we need to scramble tactical support  address   we found a sim card  one number listed in the contacts   belongs to a pay as you go  which we've traced to 185 ellwyn mews   that's a vacant property  overlooked by a trading estate   commercial  makes for a decent bolt hole   owen lynch won't let himself get caught  he'd rather die   yeah  and nobody seems to be having much of a problem with that   mobile rings  you worried about something   getting shot at  mostly   that's it  is it  be a good boy  use your words   it's just  i've been thinking   what  one number on the sim card  one number  one number  one son   yeah  i know  but it's niggling me  on a day like this   if all you've got's a niggle  you're laughing  mate   you're in prison  got nothing else to think about  but one number  one important number   well  you memorise it  don't you   you don't write it down  you memorise it   ian  we've got a special forces  nut job out there gunning down uniforms  the phone is our sole lead   all we can do is go in hard and noisy  and as ready as it's humanly possible to be   tactical do their job and  when it's done  we buy them a drink  and tell them their biceps are sexy  done  yeah  good  let's go   armed police  lay down your weapons   armed police  lay down your weapons   room clear  room clear  room clear   get out  get out   oh  my god  get out   'repeat  co19 were in the building  people lost  get ambulances now '  co19   four confirmed  six injured   well  if there's one thing you learn from being in iraq  it's how to make an ied   lynch  still searching  helicopters  ground units  dogs  door to door   no sign   but it was a remote detonated bomb   he had to be close by  watching   i mean that puts him within      how can he just slip away like that  all right  it's not your fault   he wanted us to find that sim card   i bit down on it like a     mars bar  of course it's my fault   it's official  as of five minutes ago  the owen lynch operation was passed up to anti terrorism   it's out of our hands  all they're going to do is give terry lynch what he wants   more blood  more dead coppers  we can't let them do that   i don't have much choice  do i  look  we don't have to like it but we do have to accept it   we're off the case  suck it up  move on   where are you going   guv   what's this now  eppley's radio   right  listen  we use airwave  right  secure  digital   it's impossible for civilians to by a scanner and listen in  and   owen swapped them  he swapped it  you need to call anti terrorism   and tell them he's listening to everything we say   ok  but i need you to understand  detective chief inspector  that alert them is all we can do   we can't act on this information  because this case is no longer ours   am i being transparent  tell me if i'm being at all ambiguous   there's nothing we can do with this  except pass it on   there's nothing we can do cos no one knows where owen lynch is   and he's going to keep killing until someone finds him and stops him   they'll find him   oh  yeah  how   so  here's what's going to happen  anti terrorism's going to go in big and noisy and owen dies   yep  well  then  he dies happy doesn't he  doing the job he loves   that's more than most of us get   it's a damn sight more than you're going to get   what's that then  eh  you going to bash me up  are ya   or do you think i can't take a slap   oh  i'm sure you can take a slap   i'm going to send my boy for you   yeah  you know picture the scene  doorbell rings  kick  bang   your skull goes splat  straight out   so  go on then  do your worst   i'd really like to   but murdering people leaves a lot of fuss and bother behind   so  i thought no  there's got to be another way   now  i know a lot of people in this prison   lotta screws  lotta inmates  lotta nasty people  really   but they don't bother you   cos the thing about you  terry  is that you're a hard bastard  aren't you   i mean  you can't be seen to be giving into threats  cos then you wouldn't be a hard bastard any more   and you'd rather die than lose all the respect that you've earned in here   i'm going to strip you of that dignity and make you the most reviled prisoner in here   i'd like to see you try   i'm so glad you said that because everyone knows i searched your cell   it would be the easiest thing in the world to show them that this  is what we found   yeah  go on  have a look   what you been up to  you wonky bastard  eh   go on   i have to tell you  i haven't been able to  take a look at them myself but i am told that none of those little boys are more than nine years old   it's giving you that little thrill  isn't it   no  there was terry lynch  the hard man  but now there's terry lynch  the nonce   no  no  no one would believe it   no one  right  that's what i thought  no one but then i thought to myself  terry's got a boy   a boy  and he can get his boy to do anything he tells him   hey  even kill cops   what do you have to do to a boy  to get him to do that  to have that kind of control   terry  will you tell me   eugh  what did you do to young owen  what did you do   this is a one time deal  terry   one time only  so  you better give me what i want   incoming call  have you left yet  no  we're still here  what  i don't believe it  why   john  it's illegal to threaten someone's life   if alice morgan threatened me  why don't you just arrest her   i can't  ok   why not   it's complicated  it always is   what's this woman got on you  what have you done   listen  i haven't got time for this  all right   i just need you to trust me   thing is  i'm not sure i do   if i called rose teller  would she know about this  have you called her   not yet  should i   no  don't do that  don't call her   well  that tells me everything  doesn't it   so  what's really going on   what have you done  listen  i need you to trust me   at the very least  i need you to lock your doors  lock your windows   and if anything happens  you call me immediately   so  you were right   he's lying   i've had 20 years   when do i learn  it's 20 years   god  i'm sorry   i'm so sorry   when does this go out  lead story  main bulletin  you're definitely sure about this   yeah  ok  let's go   and we're rolling   and as night falls on a stunned capital  as police  ambulance and fire crews respond to 999 calls  in full body armour  corinne day has been talking to detective chief inspector john luther  hmm  what   senior investigating officer of the so called 999 shootings   detective chief inspector luther  what do we know about owen lynch's motivations   well  we know that owen prides himself on being a soldier from a long line of soldiers   but we've interviewed his commanding officers  his military doctors  psychiatrists  holy shit   oh  no  sergeant ripley   owen had an impressive number of kills to his name  they were very aware of his character flaws   what flaws are they  well  owen was never soldier material   he was a maladjusted child who was raised on too much tv and video games   is any of this even true   not even slightly  well  we do know  that on his return from afghanistan  owen developed severe sexual difficulties and despite his  claims on a so called mission  it's quite likely that these murders  are a sexual release  a way of dealing with his sexual and personal impotence   god  what's he doing   he's making himself into a target   drawing lynch's fire from the police force in general   this is suicide    and partly because his dad isn't quite the hero he'd have us believe   his dad is an alcoholic  a wife beater   who  incidentally  denies all knowledge of his son's activities   how close are you to catching him   corinne  i've just had a long conversation with his dad  who has  provided me with vital information and  erm   owen  you'll see me soon   thank you  corinne  and now to other news       a friend of john's   we've met before  actually   leave  right now  please   or      well  go ahead  but it won't be good for john   bollocks to john   so  how can we help you   i've been wondering  why do you think he does it   why does who do what  john  his job   it takes such a toll   why does he put himself through it  i don't see how this is relevant   well  it is  right this second  you might actually be helping him   what do you think compels him to do it   he believes one life is all we have   life and love   whoever takes life steals everything   and do you agree  i don't know   i think if he's read a different book by a different writer   he'd have been a different man   he'd have been happier as a priest than     than what   than what he is   it must have been difficult for you   impossible  really   how does anyone compete with a calling like that  he wasn't blind   he knew what it was costing him  what  like his marriage   that's part of it  yeah   but you don't sound bitter  i'm not bitter  i'm     i'm proud of him  you just don't want to be married to him   not any more  no   why not  i'm not going to answer that   is it because he tried to kill henry madsen   no  but that is what you believe   do you know what henry madsen did   i have some idea  yes   he was a freak of nature   anyone would be tempted    we're not talking about anyone  we're talking about john   do you think he tried to kill him on behalf of the dead   well  i think that answers the question   it was lovely meeting you both   thank you for your time     he seriously told you nothing  he seriously told me nothing   seriously  seriously  shit   detective chief inspector john luther to control  over   boss  detective chief inspector john luther to control  over   this is control  dci luther  what is your status  over   i'm en route to the kings hill estate  over   please clarify  over   there's a flat there that belonged to one of terry lynch's old pals   owen used to visit it when he was a boy   now  i'm betting he's been there  maybe left something behind that we can use to find him  over   well  hang back on that  do not proceed unassisted to the kings hill estate   this
