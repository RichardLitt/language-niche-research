you've dropped another one   i don't see why we couldn't just catch the bus like any normal person   i could give you a piggyback   and what would the adamses say  if we turned up at ruby's birthday like that   well  it was good enough for st christopher   anyway  you can't be the best pastry chef this side of paris  and maintain peak fitness  nobody's perfect   not that you'd know it if you met the adams  they're the model family   nobody's perfect    here  darling   let me   mm   it's just a little one   it's my daughter's birthday  i'm allowed a little one   you promised me  we're going to be late   i won't have ruby see you like this  you're hurting me   you know what i said  if you went back on the drink   i meant it   i want a divorce  have you forgotten what you promised   catholic marriage is till death do us part   yours will be sooner rather than later  the way you're going   is that a threat  no  well  it ought to be   the only way i leave this marriage     is in a coffin   does your godmother get a birthday kiss  too  don't worry   i don't want to give your poor father a coronary   your secret's safe with me  it's not a secret   we're making the announcement today  john and i are engaged     over my dead body  mum      engaged to the tutor   my daughter is not marrying a lowlife trot like you  you think   what will you do about it  she's not herself  she'll come round  like hell i will   she needs my permission to marry  and i'm not giving it   so you can whistle for your wedding   oh  and mr van ert     you're fired   egyptian  this one   what kind of a cheapskate puts a foreign coin in a church collection   better than a button  i don't know   i came across some rather nice ones this morning  father   when i get six that match  they're going on one of my cardies   perhaps you can mend the hole in my pocket while you're at it   i am the parish secretary  not your seamstress   why are we bringing these   the colonel travels  he might be able to give you some real money  for them  waste not want not   leave me alone  i won't put up with this   are we late  or has the play started early   father  you didn't see notice on the gate   we cut across the fields   party's cancelled  mrs adams is    unwell   father  i'm sorry you've come all this way  the play's off   did you hear ann marie     rehearsing   she didn't want to let people down  but the fever's too strong   well    as we're here     the least we can do is help you clear up   i've just finished  but there's masses of cake in the kitchen   you can certainly help us with that   where are you going  this is very decent of you   i'm glad you understand our position   dad  you can't make him go  no one's making me do anything   john  i'm not leaving ruby   just your house   i don't stay where i'm not wanted  what about us  there is no  us    your mother and i can't bless this engagement   and without our consent  marriage isn't an option   then  we'll just wait a year  we don't even have to do that   this is the '50s  who says we need to get married   you step over this threshold  you're never coming back   i hate you   and don't think your mother will say any differently   certainly not in the state she's in    now  dear  come on  you drink this   it's all right   where's that blanket  she's frozen   wrap it around her  quickly   not a word about the argument  all right   i don't want her remembered like that  ruby   deal   there's nothing we could have done  she's already stiff   i    i really    it's an unfortunate accident  nothing more   what about the scratches around her neck   probably from twigs and weeds in the water   you can stand down now  father  i'm satisfied everything's in order   unless this is a clue   italian  by the look of it   that must narrow down our pool of suspects  eh  father   that  er    no   that must be mine   it seems like everyone is hiding something   if i tell you  you must promise to let it drop  on your honour   if it's not criminal  i promise   she was tight   she'd had most of the bottle of vodka   i'm amazed she didn't fall over sooner  she was an alcoholic   now you know why reginald didn't want the whole world to know   speaking of peccadilloes     if that's the quality of mourner around here   i'll be dropping by more often  who's that   i don't know   felicia  welcome to kembleford   planning a long visit  i am now   father brown  my condolences   mr    short   oh  no  my old nanny   chrysanthemums always were her favourite   but she was the adams' nanny   you aren't anne marie's brother   on my way to see the family now  are they expecting you   everybody loves a surprise  don't they   i came straight from london airport  flew in from nairobi this morning   so  you haven't heard  heard what   scared the hell out of me  thought you were a robber or a brigand   maybe i am  i think i've rather a talent for it   i can't see any harm in it anyhow  how can you even say that   i want to steal you away  is that a crime   then  why didn't you come back after we found mum  i needed you  i did   the place was full of police   your dad said he'd have me arrested for trespass   what  and you just went  i'm not a citizen  i can't risk it   run away with me  ruby  and leave them all behind   dad's falling apart  he needs me   now is not a good time  well  when is   at least your mom isn't going to make any problems any more   i didn't mean it like that   you sound like you're glad she's dead   eternal rest  grant unto her  o lord   and let perpetual light shine upon her   and may she rest in peace   amen   i'm sorry  i was     who are you  ruby  don't be so rude   there's no reason for her to recognise me   even i don't have many photographs of me and your mum   but i want you to have this   some things never change   we were rehearsing for some play she'd come up with   look at the get up i was in  uncle james   not looking too bad for two decades in the kenyan sun   happy valley must have lived up to its name   i can't complain   apart from arriving back here too late   what happened  i heard the bare bones but     the jetty's very slippery   i have been meaning to shorten the rope on the boat  but maybe she tripped on the mooring   or lost her balance on the boat   here we are  father   not a patch on mine  but edible   since you sell it so well  i'll pass   hold the fort  would you  please  mrs m  call of nature   father  father  what are you doing   didn't you hear ruby   that's probably what happened to poor anne marie   there's blood  under this oar   well  maybe she fell into the boat  and then hit her head on the oar in there   that's impossible   but the oars were right there when ruby found her mother   which tells us that anne marie was hit by the oar  and then the oar was put back   can i tempt you to some more barolo  oh   come on  let's send her off the way she lived   to my sister  anne marie   mrs adams   father  police are here  i'm sorry  they ask questions   inspector  may i speak to you outside   i've just come from the lake  i need to speak to the colonel   valentine  i need to speak to you urgently about mrs adams' death   i don't think so  it is rather important   what could be so important now   i believe it was murder  i believe you were involved   where's the motive  this is ridiculous  valentine  even for you   susie jasinski works for you  too  am i right  father   she's my housekeeper but i don't see     and you consider her trustworthy   yes  but    miss jasinski's just told me that   minutes before the murder  she heard you threatening mrs adams' life   what  but that's preposterous  he asked for a divorce   it can't be murder  it can't   and even if it were  it certainly wasn't reginald   what scares me is  in that case  the real killer still walking free   is it just me who's thinking it   she'd just fired van ert  forbidden your marriage   no way  not john   they say most murders are committed by someone known to the victim   who is this    van ert  ruby's old tutor   he was thrown out of the states for being a red   a communist  yeah  he must hate the aristocracy   the unfairness of people living in a pile like this   maybe he was after the diamonds   that's what they're all about   redistribution of wealth   it's true  he left pretty sharpish after she died   because he'd just been sacked   i'm sorry  ruby  but it has to be van ert   do you deny that after she told you marriage was till death do you part   you said   well  yours is going to be sooner rather than later    yes   well  no  but i didn't mean i'd kill her   we'd have come to an arrangement  worked something out   mrs adams was one of your lot   would she ever have agreed to a divorce   as a devout catholic  no  she would never     so we know the colonel wanted out and his wife would never have let him go   we have motive  means  and opportunity   colonel  i'm arresting you on suspicion of murder   you are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so  but whatever you say will be taken down in writing  and may be given in evidence   they have to let dad out    it's mum's funeral  for heaven's sake   the solicitor's doing everything he can  i'll try calling him again   you look     like a dog's dinner   it's very kind of the colonel to lend me his things   but the suit's too short and   as i said when i called  his shoes are huge   like clown feet  size eight  right   you're lucky my husband's not a big man   perfect  it all feels like a costume   annie always did love a bit of theatre   it's a shame her last play never got performed  it didn't   it was supposed to go on the night she     the evening of the     i'm sorry    hey  don't do that  i can't stand tears   i'm forced to do the most terrible   out of character things to try and stop them  such as   we have to talk  not now  john   don't look at me like that   half the village is giving me that expression   you don't really believe i killed her  do you   of course not  then  i need your help   your mother's death  a community like this   it's always going to blame the outsider   what are you saying  if you love me     i need an alibi   well  there's a turn up for the books   colonel  i'm sorry i talked to inspector   i didn't mean to make trouble   we all want the same thing  susie    to see my wife's killer put away   it wasn't me  do you believe me   am i fired   at least you're upfront   colonel adams  welcome   you let him go  for now  he's been given bail  we had to   doesn't mean i think he's innocent   if you would like to say a few words  please let me know   you will  of course  be a pallbearer   you can take albert's place   i couldn't possibly disturb things now they've set things up   well  nonsense  it's no trouble  besides  i'm in uniform   it wouldn't match  i don't see    father  my eulogy  may i ask   i take your point about uniform  excuse me   it wasn't colonel adams  what    lady felicia just told me  his back's shot   war wound   he couldn't carry the coffin   he couldn't have lifted and swung that oar  poppycock   look at him  his posture's perfect  anyway  he would've told me   what  and have the whole town know he wears a girdle   he's a proud man   he may be a foolish man but he could not have killed anne marie   but then  who did    i do declare this day that i  anne marie adams    being of sound mind      sorry  sorry  i'm late   apologies to all  mr higgins  father   what's the priest doing here   we'll come to that  it's in the order of business   we'll start with a few special clauses    firstly  to my best friend  felicia montague  i leave various   mementos and trinkets of sentimental value    oh    and to my beloved daughter  ruby      the police returned them this morning  those stones are dazzling   ah  the trewlove family heritage  the flying stars   colonel  you asked for tea   they're so cold  mum died in them  i don't want to wear them   what shall i do with them  then  put them in the safe   they should be locked away   i'm left some sentimental items  books and photographs   the rest of her estate has been left in its entirety     to the church   most unexpected and very generous   did anne marie not leave anything for her brother   well  i don't need her money  i can't wear her jewels   actually  i'm interested in a different kind of legacy  her play   what do you mean  it was cancelled the day she died   i want to restage it  get everybody on board  family  friends  servants   make it a celebration of annie's life  but     we can't let her killer stop us  performing the last thing she ever wrote  he's right   uncle james  you could take john's role and  felicia   you could stand in for mum   it'll be a bit of a scramble but i think we can make it happen   by the end of the week  saturday  it is   i don't understand  it's perfect  everybody in the house will be  watching so no one will see  i'll leave the stage in act two  and they won't look for me till curtain call   so we're really going to do it  we're eloping   if you'll take me without a penny to my name   i wouldn't have it any other way   i have never understood how you can play chess against yourself   this is not a game   yes  father  that's what my frank used to say about poker   these are not pieces  these are suspects  we can discount  the colonel and john van ert  why the tutor   he's a communist  oh  obviously  why didn't i think of that   communism  socialism  it's all greek to me   who wants to socialise with the working classes anyway   i don't see the attraction of spending my nights off with  chimney sweeps and the like   a communist doesn't have to go drinking with chimney sweeps   he wants the chimney swept and the sweeps paid   but he won't allow you to own your own soot   from the marks on anne marie's neck   we know that the murderer was after her jewels   but the one thing we know for sure about john van ert  is that he's not interested in worldly goods   so  who else is there   lady felicia was at the scene   and ruby  yes   but neither of them have sufficient motive   which leaves one last possibility   james   we know he and his sister fell out so badly  that they didn't talk to each other for 20 odd years   and she cut him out of her will  there must be real animosity there   sure  he wasn't even in the country   well  we only have his word for that   boo   why are you here  well  it's not for the sparkling conversation   you've got no reason to be hanging around   really  do you reckon  cos i hear they've got  this really pretty new parlour maid  hmm   and i just brought a couple of rabbits   just waiting for my one and six   earning an honest penny  not like you  mm   what are you really here for  hmm   quick  someone's coming  kiss me   hang on  you have excuse for why you're here   yeah  but it was fun  though  wasn't it   wasn't that uncle just slipping out  and up to no good   well  that is interesting   susie told me this morning  she saw james herself   bit of gusto  dad  please   and mrs mccarthy rang london airport and there wasn't  a flight from nairobi on the morning of the wake   so what do you think   i think you're being too suspicious  he's a decent man   interesting  educated   you should hear him on    the vatican   he probably knows as much about it as you do   don't you think that's strange in a man who spent two decades in africa   i think it's commendable   help  police  the safe's been broken into   oh  erm  five minutes  inspector   go from seeing the empty safe  dad  we need real horror   looks who's here  help  police  the safe's been broken into   excuse me  much better  don't raise your suspicions about james with him   you'll just make a fool of yourself   and when has that ever bothered me  father     i don't know about the flights  but the reason he's been creeping about at night    is to see me   felicia  your cue  i hope i can rely on your discretion   as the next scene begins  the stage is dark   police  i know you're in there  come out and     i wouldn't do that   keep your hands up where i can see them   you  i never thought for a second it would be you   i'll take that as a compliment  you'll never get away with this   oh  felicia  don't forget the ketchup   there's a bag for under your clothes  this needs to look real   we'll see about that   not investigating  i hope  father   let's make the next scene change really seamless   apparently my spare cassock has a starring role   we'll see about that   james trewlove is off the suspect list   i've already checked him out  but what about the flights   he was definitely still in nairobi when anne marie died   i have confirmation from the chief of police   and how does the chief of police know   um    they were having dinner   how long have you worked here   yeah  uh huh  uh huh  mm   when am i next on  dad  i've stuck your cues up here   i put costumes out  please  no one mess up   where have these been  attic   some of it dates back as far as your day  so if it stinks   you know who to blame  the hall's filling up   take your positions  is everybody ready   amore mio  mi sto innamorando di te   that's beautiful  i wish i knew what it meant   that would be telling   how did you manage to learn italian  anyway  out in africa   well  that     would be telling    too   i suppose i should  or felicia will never talk to me again   how much  a shilling   daylight robbery   no good  lira  italian   oh  like a bad penny   i should have left it where i dropped it by the lake   you didn't drop this one  father   i'm collecting italian coins for my pilgrimage to rome   well  the lira never left the presbytery   father   i didn't think theatre was your thing   i'm not here for the show  not that one  anyway   we're about to make an arrest  who   not john  not van ert  no  he's got an alibi   when i spoke to ruby earlier  she  erm     vouched for him   are you telling me they were having sex   i do know what sex is  inspector   and she won't be the first girl who lied for her lover   so who is your chief suspect   for once  we may be singing the same song   i'm here for lady felicia   when she comes off stage  i'm taking her in for questioning   have you gone     i've got witnesses who've seen her at the house  in the small hours  yes  but    that gives me clear motive   her affair with the colonel  her best friend's husband   the colonel  no  that's not right   james trewlove saw them together  james did    are you sitting comfortably  then  we'll begin   here's a list of what i need    susie  where are james' shoes   he needs heels with that dress  i couldn't find any  feet too big   he's an eight  he could squeeze into annie's   not eight  11  very big  huge   those shoes you gave to him for the funeral swamped him   shoes i put out were mr trewlove's   nonsense  james didn't bring any formal shoes   not from suitcase  from attic   unless his feet have shrunk     here   see yourself   'well  good  call me when it's ready   'until then  i'll be in my study  phew  that was close '  cue coming up   where are the heels  here   those are the best i could do   no  i'll have to wear mine   help  police  the safe's been broken into   and we're on  come on  go on  you're going to be great   police  oh  you're here  help  police   i wouldn't do that if i were you  put your hands up  don't say a word   why would you do this to me  didn't you hear me  i said shut up  or i'll shut you up   you and anyone trying to help   i always thought she was a little actress   you'll never get away with this  help me  help me   no   isn't she brilliant    we'll see about that  excuse me   dad  hadn't you better get changed  you're on again in five   i can't believe he'd betray us  everything's lost   my dowry  my future     cancel the wedding  i can hardly get married now   the safe's been broken into  er  dad    the safe's been broken into   we've done that scene  listen  i'm not acting   we've been burgled  the stars have gone   woman in dark clothing came out the front door and got in a cab   which way did she go  down the drive   i'm relying on you to have overheard where to   even if i knew where he was  do you think i'd hand him over   he's a thief  ruby  don't you see  he's betrayed you   he'd never do that  i hope you never catch him   come on  this is ridiculous  got him  no  it's not him   don't you see   if i wanted to steal the diamonds   i could have done  they're mine  but van ert couldn't   and the countess   well  the fact that she's run means she's got something to hide   solving a theft and a murder in one day  that's not a bad innings   inspector  before he left  father ask me to give you message   he said you must let lady felicia go   what is it with that priest   i don't turn up on sundays to give his sermon   it's all right  dear  i haven't caught her yet   these were upstairs  packed and ready to go   looks like your daughter was eloping   we were running away together  yes  it's not a crime   i'm sorry  darling  but it's obvious   he planned to steal the stars  and leave without you   so  tell me  if you're right  where are the diamonds now   excuse me  sir  excuse me   excuse me  excuse me   on my life  it isn't him  there must be others without alibis   all watching the play  except for the people in it  all accounted for   apart from felicia  where's she   i believe the countess could kill  but for love  not money   i don't believe she'd steal diamonds  that's not why she ran   ran  you think she left  well  she's not here   i was outside waiting for ruby until the moment you had me arrested   lady felicia didn't leave the building  then     where is she   excuse me  i do beg your pardon   you won't get away with it   and if you wanted to pass incognito   you should really have changed your shoes   i'm keeping the diamonds   leave the compartment  get off at the next stop  and nobody gets hurt   but somebody already has been hurt  haven't they  you killed anne marie   that's absurd   i wasn't even in the country   and why on earth would i murder my own sister   but she wasn't your sister  was she   yours  i believe  you weren't in africa   you were in italy before you came to kembleford   fought with anne marie adams on the day of ruby's birthday   and then dropped that coin in the struggle   father  you have a real talent for fiction   the photograph was a clever touch  that had me flummoxed for a while   how could i possibly fake that   you didn't  but your clothes weren't a costume   they were what you would have been wearing   as the nanny's son   i had it right the first time we met  didn't i  mr short   it must have been terrible for you   coming back from the continent  discovering your mother had died   visiting her grave and finding her buried like a pauper   did you blame anne marie for her death  this is nonsense   i suspect you must have thought the adamses owed her more than that   aged retainers should be pensioned off   not thrown out with the rubbish   but anne marie couldn't give you a penny  wouldn't   so you decided to take the diamonds  she fought back and you killed her   it was an accident  but it wasn't an accident  when you then decided to stand in as her brother   and take whatever he was set to inherit   the only person who suspected anything was lady felicia   i don't know what she spotted   but when she came on stage  she called for the police   police  oh  you're here  help  police   i wouldn't do that if i were you  put your hands up   but that can't have been her line  she was the police   shut up  or i'll shut you up   you'll never get away with this  help me  help  oh   i only hope that was chloroform i smelt on your hanky   and that you haven't really hurt her   is she really hurt  no  please   tomato   i didn't harm felicia  i just had to shut her up  as for anne marie     i didn't mean to hurt her  she deserved everything she got   she deserved to die  for not paying your mother's pension   mum worked for them for 45 years   she brought up two generations of that family   they saw more of her than i ever did   and then when she got old   they turned her out without a penny   that's what killed her  anne marie's the murderer  not me   but she didn't have a penny to give   they were as much paupers as your mother was   but    the will  the bequests   after the diamonds  her estate was bequeathed to the church   so we got a rather nice icon  a bible  and two rosaries   the financial value of the bequest was precisely zero   why didn't she just tell me   you hit a nerve  and i hear she had been drinking   she was plastered  i just wanted the money mum was owed   enough for a proper gravestone  for a start   you will give me what she is owed   you think you can tell me what to do  but you can't   if you won't give it to me  i'll take it   leave me alone   i won't put up with this   why didn't you go in  try to save her   i can't swim   yes  i was angry  but i didn't want her dead   i loved her   give me the diamonds  i'll return them to ruby   as for anne marie    give yourself up  pay for your crimes   you mean hang  no  it's manslaughter  not murder   it'll mean prison   but you'll give the father and the daughter justice   i suppose i don't have much choice   better to give yourself up  come quietly   afternoon   let me help you with the clasp   what are you waiting for    why didn't you stop him   you're always trying to save their souls   he lost his when he ran  you were trying to take him to the police   and so ruby could get her inheritance back   oh  any idiot could see  your precious flying stars were as fake as he was   you heard about uncle     about the impostor   mmm   shouldn't be sad  should i  but  somehow     i guess the good news is  i still have an uncle   even if he is still in nairobi   dad  please  don't look like that   i'm sorry i was running away  i didn't think i had a choice   it's not just that   we're in debt   up to our eyeballs   this place is about to be repossessed   why didn't you tell me   i'll sell the stars when they find them   they're crushed to dust  diamonds don't crumble  no   but paste does   i might as well tell you now   i put the stars in hock ten years ago   the necklace your mum left you was a good copy   but paste  nonetheless   i i don't understand  if you're in that much debt   how could you ever hope to pay it off   only by your marrying well   i wasn't against john because he's a tutor   or even because he's a communist   but he can't provide for you   and nor can i   so what choice is there   you should be celebrating   being taken for a fool   losing my daughter   having to admit we're close to losing our home   gaining freedom  sorry  perhaps the truth is   this house is a burden to the next generation  not a legacy   do you want to weigh your daughter down as you've been your whole life   and of course  you have another gain   a son in law  he's not a gold digger   he would have taken her with nothing   i suppose you want my blessing   so you can marry them  oh  i'll marry them  with your blessing or without it   but why go all the way to gretna green  when we have a perfectly good church here   come on  colonel   what do you say   nice catch   beautiful day for it  reminds me of my wedding day  oh   such a shame   why do i always pick the wrong 'uns   so    spill the beans  who's that   that's the real uncle james   ooh   excuse me  excuse me
