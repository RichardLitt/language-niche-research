visit   a hundred years ago  there were one and a half  billion people on earth   now  over six billion  crowd our fragile planet   but even so  there are still places  barely touched by humanity   this series will take to the last wildernesses  and show you the planet  and its wildlife  as you have never  seen them before   imagine our world without sun   male emperor penguins are facing  the nearest that exists on planet earth    winter in antarctica   it's continuously dark  and temperatures drop  to minus seventy degrees centigrade   the penguins stay  when all other creatures have fled  because each guards a treasure   a single egg rested  on the top of its feet  and kept warm beneath  the downy bulge of its stomach   there is no food  and no water for them   and they will not see  the sun again for four months   surely no greater ordeal  is faced by any animal   as the sun departs  from the antarctic  it lightens the skies  in the far north   it's march  and light returns  to the high arctic   sweeping away  four months of darkness   a polar bear stirs   she has been in her den  the whole winter   her emergence marks  the beginning of spring   after months of confinement underground  she toboggans down the slope   perhaps to clean her fur   perhaps for sheer joy   her cubs gaze out  of their bright new world  for the very first time   the female calls them   but this steep slope is not  the easiest place to take your first steps   but they are hungry  and eager to reach their mother   who's delayed feeding them  on this special day   now she lures them with the promise of milk   the only food the cubs have known  since they were born  deaf and blind beneath the snow  some two months ago   their mother has not eaten  for five months  and has lost half her body weight   now she converts the last of her fat  reserves into milk for her cubs   the spring sun brings warmth  but also a problem for the mother   it starts to melt the sea ice   that is where she hunts for the seal  she needs to feed her cubs   and she must get there  before the ice breaks up   for now though  it's still minus thirty degrees  and the cubs must have  the shelter of the den   it's six days since the bears emerged  and spring is advancing rapidly   but even now blizzards  can strike without warning   being so small   the cubs are easily chilled and they will  be more comfortable resting in the den   but their mother must keep them out and active   she's becoming weak from hunger  and there's no food  on these nursery slopes   the sea ice still holds firm   but it won't last much longer   day 10   and the mother has led  her cubs a mile from the den   it's time to put them to the test   they've grown enormously in confidence   but they don't have  their mother's sense of urgency   at last it seems that they're  ready for their journey  and they're only just in time   for a few miles from the coast  the ice is already splitting   now the mother can start hunting  for the seals they must have   but she's leading her cubs  into a dangerous new world   nearly half of all cubs die  in their first year out on the ice   summer brings 24 hours of sunlight  and the thawing shifting landscape   further south the winter snows have  almost cleared from the arctic tundra   northern canada's wild frontier   here nature stages  one of her greatest dramas    every year three million caribou  migrate across the arctic tundra   the immensity of the herd can only  be properly appreciated from the air   some herds travel over 2 000 miles  a year in search of fresh pastures   this is the longest overland  migration made by any animal   they're constantly on the move   newborn calves have to be  up and running the day they are born   but the vast herds  do not travel alone   wolves   packs of them  eight to ten strong   shadow the migration   and they are hungry   it's the newly born calves  that they are after   running directly at the herd  is a ploy to generate panic   the herd breaks up  and now it's easier  to target an individual   in the chaos a calf is  separated from its mother   the calf is young   but it can outrun the wolf  if only it manages to keep its footing   at this stage  the odds are even    either the caribou  will make a mistake  or after a mile  the wolf will give up   midsummer on the tundra  and the sun does not set   at these latitudes  the sun's rays are glancing  and not enough of their energy reaches the ground  to enable trees to grow   you'll need to travel   before that is possible   these stunted shrubs  mark the tree line    the beginning of the boreal forest    the taiga   the needle shaped leaves  of the conifers are virtually inedible  so this forest supports  very little animal life   it's a silent place  where the snow is unmarked  by footprints   in the arctic winter  snow forms a continuous blanket  across the land   but as spring creeps up  from the south  the taiga is unveiled   this vast forest circling the globe  contains a third  of all the trees on earth  and produces so much oxygen  it changes the composition  of the atmosphere   as we travel south  so the sun's influence  grows stronger  and at 50 degrees of latitude  a radical transformation begins   summers here are long enough for  broadleaf trees to replace conifers   broadleaves are much easier  to eat and digest  so now animals can collect  their share of the energy  that has come from the sun   it's summer  and these forests  are bustling with life   but the good times  will not last   broad leaves must be shed in winter  for their damage by frost   as they disappear   so the land becomes barren  with little for animals to eat   the inhabitants must migrate   hibernate   or face months of near starvation   the amur leopard    the rarest cat in the world   here  in the deciduous forests of eastern russia  the winter makes hunting  very difficult   pray animals are scarce   and there's no concealing vegetation   the cub is a year old  and still dependent on its mother   deer are frequent casualties  of the harsh winter  and these leopards are not above  scavenging from a corpse   african leopards could  never survive here   but the russian cats have thick fur  to shield them from the cold   there are only forty  amur leopards left in the wild  and that number is falling   like so many creatures   the cats have been pushed  to the very edge of extinction  by hunting and the destruction  of their habitat   the amur leopard symbolises  the fragility of our natural heritage   the future of an entire species  hangs on survival  of a tiny number of mothers  like this one   all animals  rare or common   ultimately depend  for their energy on the sun   in japan the arrival  of the cherry blossom  announces the beginning of spring   the sun's energy brings  colour to the landscape   the earth  as it makes its annual  journey around the sun   spins on a tilted axis   and it's this tilt  that creates the seasons   the advance of the seasons  brings constant change   as the sun's influence diminishes in the north   so the deciduous forests of america  begin to shut down  losing their leaves in preparation  for the dark cold months ahead   one season hands over to another   some organisms thrive on decay   but most must make special  preparations for winter  and a life with little sun   whole populations of animals  are now forced to travel great distances  in pursuit of food and warmth   to escape from the siberian winter  by migrating south to korea    the world's entire population  in a single flock   but there are parts of the world  that have no seasons   in the tropics the sun's rays  strike the earth head on  and their strength is  more or less constant all year round   that is why the jungle  grows so vigourously  and supports so much life   this forest covers only 3 percent  of the planet's surface   but it contains more than 50 percent  of all its plants and animals   the canopy is particularly rich   there are monkeys  birds  and millions of species of insects   exactly how many we have no idea   the character of the forest  changes as we descend   becoming ever darker and damper   favouring different kinds  of animals and plants   less than 2 percent  of the sunlight reaches the floor   but even here there is  extraordinary variety   in the great island of new guinea  there are 42 different species  of birds of paradise   each more bizarre than the last   this forest is so rich  that nourishing food can be gathered very quickly   that leaves the male  six plumed bird of paradise  with time to concentrate  on other matters  like tidying up his display area   everything must be spick and span   all is ready   very impressive   but no one is watching   the superb bird of paradise  calls to attract a female   and he has more luck   but what does he have to do  to really impress her   she retires to consider her verdict   it's hard not to feel deflated  when even your best  isn't good enough   the sun influences life in the oceans  just as it does on land   its richest parts are those  where waves and currents  bring fertilising nutrients  to surface waters  that are bathed in sunlight   the seas off the cape in south africa  have this magic recipe  and are hugely productive   summer is the time of plenty  and it's now that the seals  start to breed   the strike of a great white shark  lasts a mere second   slowing it down forty times  reveals the technique  and immense strength  of this massive predator   if surprise fails   there will be a chase   the shark is faster  on a straight course  but it can't turn  as sharply as the seal   its agility versus power   once the seals have finished breeding  the giant sharks will move on   it's now becoming clear  that great whites migrate  thousands of miles across the oceans  to harvest seasonal abundances  in different seas   the sun  beating down  on tropical waters   powers the weather systems  of the globe   moisture evaporates  from the warming ocean  and rises to create  great storms   the winds generated out at sea  sweep inland across the continents   as they travel across the sahara  they create the biggest  of all sand storms  blowing sand halfway  round the world  to fertilize the amazon jungle   winds blowing across the indian ocean  collect moisture and sweep northwards  towards the himalayas   as the air rises   so it cools   the water it carries  condenses into clouds  and then falls as the life giving  rains of the monsoon   so air currents  powered by the sun  carry wet air to the middle of continents   without water  there can be no life   but its distribution  over the land is far from even   deserts cover one third  of the land's surface  and they're growing bigger  every year   this is the kalahari desert  in southern africa   it's the dry season  and thousands of elephants  have started to travel  in desperate search for water   all across southern africa animals  are journeying for the same reason   buffalo join the great trek   nowhere else on earth  are so many animals on the move  with the same urgent purpose   they're all heading  for the swamps of the okavango   a vast inland delta   at the moment it is dry   but water is coming   the travellers are hampered  by dangerous dust storms   females and calves can easily get  separated from the main herd   for this pair sanctuary lies  in the patch of woodland a few miles ahead   they can't rest  until they reach it   the main has already  got there safely   finally  the stragglers  emerge from the dust   the exhausted calf is  still blinded by sand   its mother does  everything possible to help it    but not all the elephants  have been so lucky   one youngster has got lost   thirsty and exhausted   it follows the tracks  of its mother   but sadly  in the wrong direction   at the peak of the dry season  in the kalahari  water arrives in the okavango   it fell as rain a thousand miles away  in the highlands of angola  and has taken nearly  five months to reach here   the water drives out insects  from the parched ground   which are snapped up by plovers   catfish  travelling with the flood   collect any drowning creatures  the birds have missed   it's a seasonal feast  for animals of all kinds   birds are the first  to arrive in any numbers    wattled cranes   then black storks   behind the birds come buffalo   after weeks of marching  their trek is coming to an end   as the water sweeps into the okavango  a vast area of the kalahari  is transformed into a fertile paradise   nowhere on our planet is the life giving  power of water so clearly demonstrated   the okavango becomes  criss crossed with trails  as animals move into its heart   the new arrivals open up  paths like arteries  along which water flows   extending the reach of the flood   this is an africa rarely seen    a lush water world   some creatures are completely  at home here   these are lechwe    antelope with hooves that splay widely   enabling them to move  its speed through the water   for others the change  is far less welcome   baboons are somewhat  apprehensive bathers   the water brings a season  of plenty for all animals   hunting dogs   these are now among  the rarest of africa's mammals   but then nonetheless  the continent's most efficient predators   their secret is teamwork   impala are their favourite prey   they start to hunt  and the pack splits up   an aerial viewpoint gives  a new insight into their strategy   as the dogs approach their prey  they peel off to take up separate  positions around their target   they seem to form  a cordon around the impala   moving in total silence  they take up their positions   those ears can detect  the slightest rustle   the hunt is on   three dogs close in  on one impala   missed   the lead dog drives the impala  towards the hidden flankers   anticipating their line  the leader cuts the corner  and joins a flanker  for the final assault   it's all or nothing   one on one   the dog has stamina   the impala has speed   leaping into the lake  is an act of desperation    impala can barely swim   the dogs know their prey  must come out or drown    now it's a waiting game   the rest of the pack are calling   they've made a kill  in the forest  and this is an invitation  to join in the meal   the impala is in luck   a pack this size kills once a day  and everything is shared   and this impala is reprieved   the elephants are nearing  the end of their long journey   after weeks of marching  they're desperately tired   the matriarch can smell water  and encourages the herd  to make one last effort   the youngsters are exhausted  but their mothers have made  this journey before  and they know  that they're close to water   after many hundreds  of miles they've arrived   the lives of these elephants are dominated  by the annual rhythm of wet and dry   a seasonal cycle  created by the sun   at the southern end of the earth   after four months of total darkness   the sun once more  rises over antarctica   now at last the emperor penguins  abandon their huddle   the males are still carrying  the precious eggs  that they've cherished  throughout the antarctic winter   with the returning sun  the eggs hatch   other birds have  not even arrived   but the emperors  by enduring the long black winter  have given their chicks  a head start   these youngsters are now ready and eager  to make the most of the brief antarctic summer   visit written   synchr  by m06166
