we used to make a difference  every day  we saved lives     we fought    that was the war     this is different    perhaps we could  treat the killings like a code   keep at it till we break it   gap in the pattern     i missed one    susan  if this pattern  was easy to find  you would've found it by now   yoy really think that     just by listening to the wireless you can tell the police  where to look for a murder victim   the railways   that's how he's finding them   if the killer is a railguard or ticket inspector  then his schedule is connected to her journey    in somewhere    he's invisible   first things first  we need to find mary lawrence   this girl you think we've missed       how do we find her    he's working to a timetable   the other variable   location   i'm sorry  mrs  gray  my men searched the area   there's nothing there  nothing at all   if we get ahead of him   we can stop him before he kills again   oh  dear christ   god have mercy   anyone can make a mistake  susan   she's dead   we were too late   what did you think it would be like  susan   'i didn't think it would be so   '  a life so cruelly cut short   we must try to let her live in our memories     did you see the cigarette butts on the floor   what does it matter   it matter  because it means he took his time in there   it matter  because he stops for a smoke  for god's sake    itfc subtitle sync  marocas62  the bletchley circle part 2  more news on the oil price crisis  later today     no arrest has yet been made in the case of mary lawrence  whose death is linked to that of four other women   police are appealing for any witnesses to come forward   and help in this inquire   deputy commissioner wainwright of scotland yard  said early this morning  that any information will be treated in strictest confidence   elsewhere in the city bacon rations       how was it    grim     right  how are we getting on    it's down to seven suspects   did you check the engineering service   no  none  we do it right now   they close the lines off in pairs   yes  so you get schedule changes fortnightly     i see    that takes these two out straightaway   and peter lakes  he was in the mainline service before   they moved  didn't they   he was part of the crew that did alternative shifts in february   yes  so he comes off   and this one  oliver cartwright  he was part of the p19 shift   i thought he was p6     only until      april 8th   good  right  three names and a week to go     running out of time    we need to hand it over   mrs  gray   the deputy commissioner can see you now   hello again  mrs  gray   i believe you have some more information for us   yes  i've analysed the journeys the girls made  and they connect in someway  to the 6 15 slow train from st pancras to barking   i think that the man you're looking for  either is a ticket inspector or a guard on that service   why a guard  why not a passenger   because he'd have to lure them off the train without a struggle   it'd have to be someone they trust  someone in authority   come in   sir  mr  reynolds is here   i'm sorry  you'll have to excuse me   do tell dci compton everything you can   so you were saying     guard or a ticket inspector   because of the journeys the girls made  when they were abducted   we've    i've worked out the schedules for all 87 guards  who work there  to narrow it down   there were work at st pancras  at that time  engineering works  i mean     right    which means they were chopping  and changing staff schedules  so   guards were doing duties on other trains  because their used service was cancelled   how does that relate to the murdered girls   well  before the fact of the engineering works   we did have 38 possible solutions   but adding in the altered rail services   it gave us a whole new set of variables   the number of suspects changed   why it's got do a trains  anyway   only one girl was found under a railway arch   no  it's not to do with where they were found   it's to do with how he targets them   the journeys the girls made  on the day they were abducted  is the only significant link between them   perhaps if i could have five minutes with     mrs  gray  the deputy commissioner is very busy   and i am sure you can appreciate that     i'll pass your ideas onto him    they're not just ideas     you've got evidence    yes  i've got evidence   yes  this is the evidence   list of the three names   tommy casterwell  antony cross  gerald wiggins    it's one of these three  don't waste your time   you've only got three days left   i promise we'll look into it   thanks again for your trouble   now  i really must get back to my men     it was a disaster    but they did take the names   they didn't take it seriously   they shouldn't look for patterns date all day long   it's not how they work   they want evidence  not theory   if we could just take them one name  not three     susan  we have cross correlated everything   what if we did a factor analysis   how   remember at bletchley  when the germans  kept shifting their code sequence   we look for incremental changes   we tracked changes to the pattern on the pattern itselves   doing a vector analysis on a crime scene  is going to take forever the day   i know  so we'd better crack on   there must be something   no vector variation  they're identical   that shows he's done the same thing every time     we need understand    there must be something     even if it's small    there's no changed  no anomalies   not even in the first one   first time you baked a cake  what happened     i don't bake cakes    mine fell   they often do first off  dear   everything comes with practice   when making a cake the first time is a mess   look at the vectors the date are straight   he's already good at this   he's done it before   we'd have heard about the murders   what happend if they were years ago   somewhere out in london   i'll try the british library   they keep archived all regional newspapers   come on  lucy  i need you and memory yours   good luck   what are you doing   the police knock on doors  why shouldn't we   what   they won't be there  they've got their schedules  remember   we can go and talk to their wives  neighbours  get an idea  of who these men are   come on     how far have you got    halfway through 1948 now  but i'm only scanning the headlines   you would've thought after the war  people had had enough of killing each other   i've got 19 murders here     any underground or strangled    nothing like that   nothing that fits   me neither     life insurance    in case your husband  has an accident at work instance  for instance   the policy would compansate his salary  ensure your family was provided for   what is your husband's occupation   he work on the railways  ticket inspector   so if he got ill or injury     what kind of ill  he's already got asthma   i'm sorry  does that affect his ability to work   i don't know how much longer he'll stick it   with the all smoke and fumes     how serious is it    he can't lift  can't run   some days he can't pick the baby up  he's so puffed   but that doesn't mean you can't insure him  does it   thank you   jean  i think i've got something   hereford times  4th november 1949   strangled   they found her in a storm drain near the gas works   oh  good lord   i think i've found one  too   oh  no  we haven't missed a match in 15 years   every tuesday and thursday   i go with him  you see  for support   you should write that down   regional darts champion for the south east   that's wonderful  i think that's all we need   thank you  bye bye   why are we leaving   matches on tuesdays and thursdays   jane hart went missing on 7th february  patricia harris   28th   oh  yes  both two on thursday   we have just an hour till the last one gets off shift   we get it move on   another seven victims all over the country   strangled and hidden like the five in london   how could the police miss that   well  they didn't  didn't they   these cases were solved   the murderers were either hanged or went to jail   james lowell  caught in hereford in 1949   he kept clothing from the girl he killed   marco giamcomi  convicted in birmingham  1950   dropped his wrist watch at the scene of the second murder   terry hudson's lighter  was found under the seventh girl's body   maybe he's making it look like  other people did it   placing false evidence at the crime scenes  that point to someone else  like the wrist watch   so one man has killed 12 girls   all around the country  over and over   fooling the police  fooling everyone     getting away with it    you think it's impossible   i don't know   i mean  look at all these cases   if this really was the work of one man   he'd have to plan three steps ahead of everyone else   every single detail with military precision     as if he were      as if he were what   as if he were deceiving the enemy   what did that paper say about     terry hudson and the ration coupons    upon searching hudson's house in derby street   police also discovered forged ration coupons   they believe hudson was selling on the black market      that does not seem odd    i don't know  not really   because they also say he was feeble minded     yes    they can't have it both ways   feeble minded  impulsive enough to kill  and running a racket forge coupon   no  it doesn't fit   terry hudson wasn't clever enough to be a forger   our killer is   so     where would he have learnt to do that   i think there's someone we should talk to   jean mcbrian  my goodness     hasn't it been a long time    it certainly has     this is lucy davies    would you like to come to my office   so what brings you to the central records office anyway   i    i have a favour to ask   oh  yes   it's regarding our time during the war   what kind of favour   lucy was at bletchley  she understands these things   what kind of things exactly   keeping things     secret   oh  of course   angela  when i was at special operations executive   there were    rumours   what kind of rumours   a special department  within electra house  handling misinformation and deception  and the rumour was you worked for them   i'm afraid you've got that quite wrong   no  i was general clerical   weren't we all  dear   i wouldn't ask   except it's important   well  jean  i'd love to help you  you know that   but i was only at electra briefly   they sent me here just after you went to bletchley   my mistake   this is it  gerald wiggins  flat 22  fifth floor   hello     what are you doing    there's no one here   two clocks   this isn't what we're supposed to be doing     this is not normal    come on   i     who are you   what are you doing in gerald's flat   i'm so  so sorry  we were looking for mr  wiggins   he's back from work in a minute     how did you get in    the door was open   that was me  i came in to give patrick his seeds   but i'd left them   i feed him while gerald's out   i'm sorry if i was a bit brusque there   but you caught me by surprise   what was it you wanted with gerald   we're offering life insurance   gerald don't know what to do with that   what do you mean   well  he's not all there   he got a head wound in the war   still got shrapnel in there   so  well  he's a bit simple now   i help him out on and off   things he can't manage     but he still goes to work    oh  yes   and the railways  timetables  dates  numbers   anything like that  you know me  he comes alive   that's what he loves   it's the rest of life he has trouble with   we've always said he's working to a timetable   gerald loves timetables   yes  but she seem to know him so well   maybe he's not as harmless as she thinks   we've got it all wrong   thank you   let's talk inside     seven other girls    all around the country   he chooses a scapegoat  makes the evidence point to them   he orchestrates the whole thing   then it can't be gerald wiggins  because he didn't feet   he need the neighbor to set all  he can hardly plan for himself   this man plans everything   gerald wiggins is the one who will hang for this   he's the one they'll pin it on   mrs  gray   i'm pleased you're here  i have good news   we made an arrest this afternoon  and i have to say  it's thanks to you     what    those names  you gave our dci   it took a while to follow them up  but  it's good job we did   we found items from the girls  hidden in a locker of a ticket inspector     gerald wiggins    oh  no     what's wrong    it's not him     i beg your pardon    well     i was wrong  it's not gerald wiggins   mrs  gray   you've been an enormous help   but it's over now  we've got him   no  you don't haved   i'm not making the arrest public until i have a full confession   no  no  you have to make public  if he hears it  on the wireless  he won't take anyone else   susa  please   excuse me   thanks again  what you did helped us immensely   so he'll be on the 6 15 tonight   yes  and now they've got wiggins in the cell  there'll be no one to catch him   there must be something we can do   well  we know he'll be on that train   and we know he's looking for someone   we know what kind of girl he's looking for   what she wears  she look like     yes    what if we     give him what he's looking for   what are you suggesting   she means be bait   put on the right clothes  right lipstick  make up   get on the train  try to catch his eye   no   you'd be putting yourself in his path   you're a bright girl  susan   but that is downright idiotic   you were    you were backroom girls   jean  we were backroom girls   we never had to make this kind of choice   what kind of choice is that   whether to put yourself at risk to save someone else   even if you're not good at it  even if you're scared   but you know it's the right to do   because    because you know the only thing to do   in the war  people did that every day   this is extremely dangerous   i'll be careful   millie  it won't work  you're tall and confident   he's picking on younger girls   it's me  isn't it   it has to be me   here  let me   there   keep it  you might need to touch it up later   i'll be in the next compartment   i'll be watching  all right   millie and jean will be at harringay park and blackhorse road   if nothing happens by then  we'll call it off   got it   where did you get this stuff   ask me no questions   there   how is it   you look     yes  you're going to be fine   wedding ring   and       oh  my god    oh  god  that smell   this smell it was in the cellar   i recognised it when we were down there   it's french  charme d'or   you used to be able to get it in the war   you most certainly did not   you did if you knew who to ask   where did you get it   i know someone   i recommend people to him  he gives me a cut of what he sells   it helps pay the bills   i thought it would add to the effect   we don't all have timothy's wonderfull career  to support us  you know   this is how he gets them off the trains   we thought he was an authority figure a guard   it doesn't go with the man they do   because wearing a uniform but he's not a guard   you see   they go with him because he has something they want   perfume   nylons  anything you can only get on the sly   you think they went with him for a pair of stockings   i know you wouldn't  i wouldn't   but they've done it before  that's how they got  lipstick and mascara in first place  by taking a kind of risk   it's that how he make   that's who you're looking for   we'll be right there  remember   it's going to be fine   one more thing     i haven't loaded it yet   i don't think that's necessary   i do  when i was travelling alone   this was the best companion for single girl  believe me   i don't know how    it's easy   you just point and pull the trigger   remember  you need to get him off the train  so pretend you're interested   the moment you're on the platform drop your bags  such get up  try to slow him down   i'll be behind you  millie and jean will be right in front   scream blue murder and get the guards in the meantime     how do you feel    fine   scared   thank you   ticket  sir  thank you   hello   you look nice   going out somewhere   just to see my friend   boyfriend   none of your business  is it   i don't know  could be   girlfriend  actually   so you don't have a boyfriend   not right now   that's a crying shame  a pretty thing like you   fancy going for a little walk     what  with you    yeah  with me   i'll make it worth your while  if you like   all right   come on  then   no  not that way  this way     move    for goodness sake  be careful     what's this    freight van  and it's all ours     she's not here    well  what do i do    call the police  now   come on     do you like my perfume    i like your tits   do you know where i could get some more of it   stop playing hard to get   i'm sorry  i think there's been a mistake  i'm not interested   don't worry  i'll soon have you interested   get off   police  my friend's on a train  and i think she's being attacked   no     no    shut up   in two minutes   lucy   lucy   shit  shit   my nose  you've broken it  you silly bitch   my god  lucy  what happened      are you all right  miss    i lost     it wasn't him  it was just some clerk looking for a good time   make way  coming through   it's ok     what time do you call this    i'm sorry   it's my fault  i really do apologise   we lost track of time   i'm sure you're in a hurry to get going     we won't keep you    bye  darling   get to bed   sorry to keep you so late  it will not happen again     see you soon    good night   if i asked you     what the hell was going on   would you tell me the truth   you were on a train to barking   what's in barking   nothing  i was       it's      i don't believe you   for the first time   i don't believe you   so you lost track of time   what are you doing losing track of time     nothing    who are you doing nothing with   with millie  it was your snooker night   i think you wouldn't mind   liar  harry  please       jean    angela   i don't have time for  hello  and  how are you    i need to know right now  who was in charge of your department at soa    i told you before  i was in clerical   dear  you'll have to take a deep breath and tell me what i need to know   and if you don't   word might get out  about that little side line you had going back in the war   what on earth are you talking about   trading ration coupons   did you think i didn't know about that     jean  for heaven's sake    it's funny  how that still carries weight   people still care   if you fiddled rations during the war   what might you fiddle now  eh   who did you work for at electra house   jean   before bletchley  i was at soa   francis cavendish headed a team there  there dealing with misinformation and deception   it will be at electra house   he trained people to fool the german high command  and get away with it  just like our killer's fooling the police   they did a lot of forgery there   bank notes  ration books    just like they found in the innocent men's houses   cavendish is retired now   that's his address   i don't know  jean   should we carry on   maybe we were foolish to put lucy on that train   but you saw her face  how terrified she was   how can we let other girls go through something 1 000 times worse  when we've a chance of stopping it     mr  cavendish    yes   my name's susan gray   could i talk to you one minute   i'm afraid my time simple isn't my own this morning  mrs  gray   i was given your name by angela barker   you worked together during the war   i'm not at liberty to talk about  anything relating to that period in the war   because you signed the official secrets act  so did i   i was at bletchley park   then you should know better   you've heard about these women that have been killed   the murders   it would be hard to live in london and  not hear about it  why   the murderer is placing evidence  for the police to find   it's a trail that leads to an innocent man   that sounds very unusual   i think the man responsible might have worked for you   mrs  gray  what you're saying is both insulting and upsetting   as you were one of alan's girls   i'll extend to you a professional courtesy   i normally wouldn't  that department doesn't exist any more   but during the war it did   none of my men would do what you suggest     kill five girls    12   what   he's done it before  he's killed 12 women   the police think they have their man   my friends and i only we believe   who know they are wrong    how have you got this far   by doing what we did at bletchley   treating the crimes like a code   applied pattern analysis to  all the facts we could gather   that's very clever   but it won't give you the full picture   you need to understand the psychology of the attacker    what drives him  what makes him tick   try and get inside his head   that was my speciality  of course   how do i do that   what do you know about him   well  nothing now   you know what he does to his victims   well  he lures them off trains with trust   gets them alone  kills them   lots of people kill   what does he do specifically   he takes them somewhere dark   underground  it's strange  actually  they're such pretty girls  yet he wants them in the dark     go on    he strangles them   waits till they're dead then rapes them   what else does he do  tell me   they wear perfume   he puts them in cellars  anderson shelters  confined spaces   the smell of it becomes almost unbearable   you know who he is  don't you   what i'm going to tell you goes no further  do you understand   it's entirely confidential   but if there have been 12 deaths  i think i must tell you   there was a man  he worked for me   good at his job   very clever  very careful   and then     a bomb hit the building where he was working  and everyone was killed  we thought     but he wasn't dead   he was buried in the rubble under a stairwell   he survived  you see   for three days in the dark  until they dug him out   and     there was a girl in there  too   but she was dead   they were trapped   for three days   we sent him to a psychiatrist   because he was     different afterwards   still good at his job   almost too good  but different   i often feared what might have happened down there   but the psychiatrist said he was fit to work     as needed him  so      where is he now   there was a fire   we found his body   his signet ring  his keys   no face  of course   i chose not to pursue it  not to question it   i was almost relieved when i heard   i'll let you have all the paperwork i've got on him   there's not much  i'm afraid   there's been some sort of accident   hello   harry   the doctor's seen her  nothing's broken  thank gos   but the bruising's pretty bad   she can stay here for now   this is 1 o'clock  this is alvar lidell   police have arrested a man and charged him  with murdering five women in london area   gerald wiggins  a railway ticket inspector   was apprehended at home yesterday   inspector lawley of scotland yard  said today that wiggins appears to be mentally frail   police believe they've found evidence  linking him to all five murdered women   the petrol and fuel oil shortages at home  may be worsening     that's it  isn't it   he's gone   lucy  i'm so sorry   it's not your fault   did he take anyone from the train   not that we know of   no one's been reported missing   the police must have scared him off     that's something    that's a lot   that's a life you saved   i know  but he's still out there   we still don't know who he is   i do know who he is  actually   he's malcolm crowley   you got a name from cavendish   who's cavendish   he headed up a classified department during the war   he trained crowley  jean found him   so we have a name and whatever else is in there   bloody hell     how's your friend    recovering   what happened to her   harry beat her   it's not the first time   good god   lucy's the    little one   yes     her husband did that to her    it happens   does this have something to do with the other day   yes   but you don't want to talk to me about it   i can't   all right   i     i understand     you do    she's your friend   whatever you were trying to do for her   get her away from him   to barking  whatever   even if it didn't work  that was a good thing for a friend to do     timothy      no  no  i understand   i didn't before   but     i do now   do you   i was hoping to go and see her in the end of day   yes  well  you must     you will be back in time for      yes  of course   he was in the rubble for three days     with her body  yes    jesus   who was the psychiatrist they sent him to   dr  tremaine at meredith hospital   we should see if he remembers crowley   what happened to him   meredith's not far for me  why don't you go   are you sure   don't worry  i'll look after her     can i help you    i'm looking for a dr  tremaine   i'm afraid dr  tremaine no longer works here   the hospital's being shut down   i'm sorry   sorry  mr     croft  andrew croft   mr  croft  i'm susan gray   i'm trying to trace one of his patients from the war   are there any records  addresses  anything     what name was it    malcolm crowley   i think you'd better come inside  mrs  gray   when we first started  it was strangers in the newspapers   every step we get closer to crowley   he's closer to us   whatever is on your mind  you can tell me   all you have is conjecture  imagination   theories that are disrupting proper police work   i think he's very dangerous   this has to stop  you know   whatever this is   you're not working for anyone  are you   you did this all on your own   what about your children    among the shades of the recent dead she came    is something wrong   sync  marocas62
