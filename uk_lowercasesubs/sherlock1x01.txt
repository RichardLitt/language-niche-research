sherlock 1x01 a study in pink hdtv xvid fov   how's your blog going   yeah  good  very good   you haven't written a word  have you   you just wrote  still has trust issues    and you read my writing upside down   you see what i mean   john  you're a soldier  and it's going to take you a while to adjust to civilian life  and writing a blog about everything that happens to you will honestly help you   nothing happens to me   'what do you mean there's no ruddy car ' he went to waterloo  i'm sorry   get a cab  i never get cabs   i love you  when   get a cab   my husband  was a happy man who lived life to the full   he loved his family and his work   and that he should have taken his own life in this way  is a mystery  and a shock to all who knew him   taxi  taxi   i'll be just two minutes  mate  what   i'm just going home to get my umbrella  you can share mine   two minutes  all right   she still dancing   yeah  if you can call it that   did you get the car keys off her  got them out of her bag   where is she   the body of beth davenport  junior minister for transport   was found late last night on a building site in greater london   preliminary investigations suggest that this was suicide   we can confirm that this apparent suicide closely resembles those of  sir jeffrey patterson and james phillimore   in the light of this  these incidents are now being treated as linked   the investigation is ongoing but detective inspector lestrade will take questions now   detective inspector  how can suicides be linked   well  they all took the same poison   they were all found in places they had no reason to be   none of them had shown any prior indication  but you can't have serial suicides   well  apparently you can   these three people  there's nothing that links them   there's no link we've found yet but  we're looking for it  there has to be one   if you've all got texts  please ignore them  it just says  wrong    well  just ignore that  if there are no more questions   i'm going to bring this session to an end   if they're suicides  what are you investigating   as i say  these suicides are clearly linked   it's an unusual situation  we've got our best people investigating   says  wrong  again   one more question  is there any chance that these are murders   and if they are  is this the work of a serial killer   i know that you like writing about these but these do appear to be suicides   we know the difference  the poison was clearly self administered   yes  but if they are murders  how do people keep themselves safe   well  don't commit suicide   daily mail   this is a frightening time for people but all anyone has to do is exercise reasonable precautions   we are all as safe as we want to be   mobile phones buzz  thank you   you've got to stop him doing that  he's making us look like idiots   if you can tell me how he does it  i'll stop him   john   john watson   stamford  mike stamford  we were at barts together  yes

young things like we used to be   god  i hate them   what about you  just staying in town till you get yourself sorted   i can't afford london on an army pension   couldn't bear to be anywhere else  that's not the john watson i know  i'm not the john watson   couldn't harry help   yeah  like that's going to happen  i don't know  get a flatshare or something   who'd want me for a flatmate   what   you're the second person to say that to me today   who was the first   how fresh   just in  67  natural causes   used to work here  i knew him  he was nice   fine   we'll start with the riding crop   so  bad day was it   i need to know what bruises form in the next 20 minutes  a man's alibi depends on it  text me   listen  i was wondering  maybe later  when you're finished     you're wearing

when i'm thinking and sometimes i don't talk for days on end  would that bother you   potential flatmates should know the worst about each other   you told him about me  not a word   who said anything about flatmates   i did  told mike this morning that i must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for   now here he is just after lunch with an old friend clearly just home from  military service in afghanistan  wasn't a difficult leap   how did you know about afghanistan   got my eye on a nice little place in central london   we ought to be able to afford it   we'll meet there tomorrow evening  seven o'clock   sorry  got to dash  i think i left my riding crop in the mortuary   is that it   is that what   we've only just met and we're going to go and look at a flat   problem   we don't know a thing about each other   i don't know where we're meeting  i don't even know your name   i know you're an army doctor and you've been invalided home from afghanistan   you've got a brother worried about you but you won't go to him for help because you don't  approve of him  possibly because he's an alcoholic  more likely because he recently walked out on his wife   and i know that your therapist thinks your limp's psychosomatic  quite correctly  i'm afraid   that's enough to be going on with  don't you think   the name's sherlock holmes and the address is 221b baker street   afternoon   yeah  he's always like that   hello   ah   mr holmes  sherlock  please   well  this is a prime spot  must be expensive   mrs hudson  the landlady   she's given me a special deal   owes me

mobile phone   how   what about these suicides then  sherlock  i thought that'd be right up your street   three exactly the same   four   there's been a fourth  and there's something different this time  a fourth   where  brixton  lauriston gardens   what's new about this one  you wouldn't have come to me otherwise   you know how they never leave notes  yeah  this one did   will you come   who's

deaths   well  yes   bit of trouble too  i bet   of course  yes  enough for a lifetime  far too much   want to see some more  oh  god  yes   sorry mrs hudson  i'll skip the tea  off out  both of you   impossible suicides  four of them   no point sitting at home when there's finally something fun going on   look at you  all happy  it's not decent  who cares about decent   the game  mrs hudson  is on   taxi   ok  you've got questions     yeah  where are we going   crime scene  next   who are you  what do you do  what do you think   i'd say   private detective  but   but the police don't go to private detectives   i'm a consulting detective  only one in the world  i invented the job   what does that mean  means when the police are out of their depth  which is always   they consult me  the police don't consult amateurs   when i met you for the first time yesterday  i said afghanistan or iraq  you looked surprised   yes  how did you know  i didn't know  i saw   'your haircut  the way you hold yourself says military   'but your conversation   ' bit different from my day     said trained at barts   so army doctor  obvious   'your face is tanned     'but no tan above the wrists  you've been abroad  but not sunbathing   'your limp's really bad when you walk  but you don't ask for a chair when you stand    'so it's at least partly psychosomatic   'that says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic  '  wounded in action then  wounded in action  suntan   afghanistan or iraq   you said i had a therapist   you've got a psychosomatic limp  of course you've got a therapist   then there's your brother  mm  your phone   'it's expensive  e mail enabled  mp3 player '  and you're looking for a flatshare  you wouldn't buy this   it's a gift   'scratches  not one  many over time  '  it's been in the same pocket as keys and coins   you wouldn't treat your one luxury item like this   so it's had a previous owner  next bit's easy  you know it already   the engraving   harry watson  clearly a family member who's given you his old phone   not your father  this is a young man's gadget   could be a cousin  but you're a war hero who can't find a place to live    unlikely you've got an extended family  not one you're close to  so brother it is   now  who's clara  three kisses says it's a romantic attachment   the expense of the phone says wife  not girlfriend   must have given it to him recently  it's only six months old   marriage in trouble then   six months on he's given it away   if she'd left him  he would have kept it  sentiment   no  he wanted rid of it  he left her   he gave the phone to you  so he wants you to stay in touch   you're looking for cheap accommodation  but you're not going to your brother for help    that says you've got problems with him  maybe you liked his wife  or don't like his drinking   how can you possibly know about the drinking   shot in the dark  good one  though   power connection   tiny little scuff marks round it   every night he plugs it in but his hands are shaking   you never see those marks on a sober man's phone   never see a drunk's without them  there you go  you were right  i was right  right about what   the police don't consult amateurs   that   was amazing   do you think so  of course it was  it was extraordinary  it was quite extraordinary   that's not what people normally say  what do people normally say   piss off   did i get anything wrong   harry and me don't get on  never have   clara and harry split up three months ago  and they're getting a divorce   and harry is a drinker   spot on  then  i didn't expect to be right about everything   harry's short for harriet   harry's your sister  look  what exactly am i supposed to be doing here  sister   no   seriously  what am i doing here  there's always something   hello  freak  i'm here to see detective inspector lestrade   why   i was invited   why  i think he wants me to take a look   well  you know what i think  don't you  always sally   i even know you didn't make it home last night   i don't    who's this  colleague of mine  dr watson   dr watson  sergeant sally donovan   old friend   a colleague how do you get a colleague   did he follow you home   would it be better if i just waited    no   freak's here  bringing him in   ah  anderson  here we are again   it's a crime scene  i don't want it contaminated  are we clear on that   quite clear   and is your wife away for long   oh  don't pretend you worked that out  somebody told you that   your deodorant told me that   my deodorant   it's for men  well  of course it's for men   i'm wearing it   so's sergeant donovan   ooh    i think it just vaporised  may i go in   whatever you're trying to imply     i'm not implying anything  i'm sure sally came round for a nice little chat  and just happened to stay over   and i assume she scrubbed your floors  going by the state of her knees   you'll need to wear one of these   who's this   he's with me   but who is he  i said he's with me   aren't you going to put one on   so where are we  upstairs   i can give you two minutes   may need longer   her name's jennifer wilson according to her credit cards   we're running them now for contact details   hasn't been here long   some kids found her   shut up   i didn't say anything  you were thinking  it's annoying   got anything   not much   she's german   rache  it's german for revenge  she could be trying to tell us something     yes  thank you for your input   so she's german  of course she's not  she's from out of town though   intended to stay in london for one night  before returning home to cardiff  so far  so obvious   sorry   obvious  what about the message though   dr watson  what do you think   of the message  of the body  you're a medical man   we have a whole team right outside   they won't work with me  i'm breaking every rule letting you in here     yes   because you need me   yes  i do   god help me   dr watson  hm   oh  do as he says  help yourself   anderson  keep everyone out for a couple of minutes     well  what am i doing here   helping me make a point  i'm supposed to be helping you pay the rent  this is more fun   fun  there's a woman lying dead   perfectly sound analysis  but i was hoping you'd go deeper   yeah     asphyxiation  probably  passed out  choked on her own vomit   can't smell any alcohol on her   it could have been a seizure  possibly drugs   you know what it was  you've read the papers   well  she's one of the suicides  the fourth      sherlock   two minutes  i said  i need anything you got   victim is in her late 30s  professional person  going by her clothes    i'm guessing the media  going by the frankly alarming shade of pink   travelled from cardiff today intending to stay in london one night from the size of her suitcase   suitcase  yes  she's been married at least ten years  but not happily   she's had a string of lovers but none of them knew she was married   oh  for god's sake  if you're just making this up     her wedding ring  ten years old at least   the rest of her jewellery has been regularly cleaned  but not her wedding ring   the inside is shinier than the outside   the only polishing it gets is when she works it off her finger   it's not for work  look at her nails  she doesn't work with her hands so who does she remove her rings for   not one lover  she'd never sustain the fiction of being single for that long  so more likely a string of them  brilliant   sorry  cardiff   it's obvious  isn't it  it's not obvious to me   dear god  what is it like in your funny little brains  it must be so boring  her coat    it's slightly damp  she's been in heavy rain the last few hours    no rain anywhere in london in that time   under her coat collar is damp too  she's turned it up against the wind   she's got an umbrella in her pocket but it's dry and unused   not just wind  strong wind   too strong to use her umbrella   we know from her suitcase that she was intending to stay overnight  but she can't have travelled more than two or three hours because her coat still hasn't dried   so   where has there been heavy rain and strong wind within the radius of that travel time   cardiff   fantastic  do you know you do that out loud   sorry  i'll shut up  no  it's   fine   why do you keep saying suitcase  yes  where is it   she must have had a phone or an organiser  find out who rachel is  she was writing rachel   no  she was leaving an angry note in german   of course she was writing rachel  no other word it can be   why did she wait until she was dying to write it  how do you know she had a suitcase   tiny splash marks on her right heel and calf not present on the left   she was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her with her right hand  by that splash pattern   smallish case  going by the spread   case that size  woman this clothes conscious    could only be an overnight bag so we know she was staying one night   where is it  what have you done with it   there wasn't a case   say that again  there wasn't a case  there was never any suitcase   suitcase  did anyone find a suitcase  was there a suitcase in this house   sir  there was no case   but they take the poison themselves  swallow the pills   there are clear signs  even you lot couldn't miss them  right  thanks  and      it's murder  all of them  i don't know how   but they're not suicides  they're serial killings   we've got a serial killer  there's always something to look forward to   why are you saying that  her case  come on  where is her case   did she eat it someone else was here  and they took her case   so the killer must have driven here  forgot the case was in the car   she could have checked into a hotel  left it there   no  look at her hair  she colour coordinates her lipstick and her shoes   she'd never have left any hotel with her hair still looking     oh     oh   sherlock  what is it  what   serial killers  always hard  you have to wait for them to make a mistake   we can't just wait  oh  we're done waiting  look at her  really look   houston  we have a mistake  get on to cardiff   find out who jennifer wilson's family and friends were  find rachel   of course  yeah   but what mistake    pink   anderson  let's get on with it     he's gone  who  sherlock holmes   yeah  he just took off  he does that   is he coming back  didn't look like it   right   right     yes  sorry  where am i   brixton   do you know where i could get a cab   it's just er     well    my leg   er       try the main road   thanks   but you're not his friend   he doesn't have friends   so who are you   i'm   i'm nobody  i just met him   ok  bit of advice then  stay away from that guy   why   you know why he's here   he's not paid or anything   he likes it  he gets off on it   the weirder the crime  the more he gets off  and you know what      one day just showing up won't be enough   one day we'll be standing round a body and he'll be the one that put it there   why would he do that  because he's a psychopath   psychopaths get bored   lestrade  donovan  coming   stay away from sherlock holmes   phone rings  phone rings  phone stops ringing  taxi  taxi     phone rings  phone rings off abruptly  phone rings  phone rings  phone keeps ringing  hello   man  'there is a security camera on the building to your left   'do you see it '  who's this   who's speaking   'do you see the camera  dr watson '  yeah  i see it  'watch     'there is another camera on the building opposite you  do you see it '  mm hm   'and finally  at the top of the building on your right '  camera whirs  how are you doing this   'get into the car  dr watson   'i would make some sort of threat  but i'm sure your situation is quite clear

john   you know  i've got a phone   i mean  very clever and all that   but er     you could just phone me   on my phone   when one is avoiding the attention of sherlock holmes  one learns to be discreet  hence this place   your leg must be hurting you  sit down   i don't want to sit down   you don't seem very afraid   you don't seem very frightening   he chuckles yes     the bravery of the soldier   bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity  don't you think   what is your connection to sherlock holmes   i don't have one  i barely know him  i met him   yesterday   mmm  and since yesterday you've moved in with him and now you're solving crimes together   might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week   who are you  an interested party   interested in sherlock  why   i'm guessing you're not friends   you've met him  how many friends do you imagine he has   i am the closest thing to a friend that sherlock holmes is capable of having  and what's that   an enemy  an enemy   in his mind  certainly   if you were to ask him  he'd probably say his arch enemy   he does love to be dramatic   well  thank god you're above all that   text message alert  i hope i'm not distracting you   not distracting me at all   do you plan to continue your association with sherlock holmes   i could be wrong     but i think that's none of your business   it could be  it really couldn't   if you do move into  erm       221b baker street   i'd be happy to  pay you a meaningful sum of money on a regular basis to ease your way   why   because you're not a wealthy man   in exchange for what   information   nothing indiscreet  nothing you'd feel   uncomfortable with   just tell me what he's up to  why   i worry about him  constantly   that's nice of you   but i would prefer for various reasons that my concern go unmentioned   we have what you might call a    difficult relationship   text message alert  no  but i haven't mentioned a figure   don't bother   you're very loyal very quickly   no  i'm not  i'm just not interested    trust issues    it says here   what's that   could it be that you've decided to trust sherlock holmes of all people   who says i trust him  you don't seem the kind to make friends easily   are we done   you tell me   i imagine people have already warned you to stay away from him   but i can see from your left hand that's not going to happen   my what  show me   don't     remarkable  what is   most people   blunder round this city  and all they see are streets and shops and cars   when you walk with sherlock holmes  you see the battlefield   you've seen it already  haven't you   what's wrong with my hand   you have an intermittent tremor in your left hand   your therapist thinks it's post traumatic stress disorder   she thinks you're haunted by memories of your military service   who the hell are you   how do you know that  fire her  she's got it the wrong way round   you're under stress right now and your hand is perfectly steady   you're not haunted by the war  dr watson     you miss it   welcome back   text message alert  time to choose a side  dr watson   i'm to take you home   address   er  baker street    but i need to stop off somewhere first   listen  your boss  any chance you could not tell him this is where i went   sure  you've told him already  haven't you   yeah   hey erm    do you ever get any free time   she chuckles oh  yeah  lots   bye    ok   he exhales slowly  what are you doing   nicotine patch   helps me think   impossible to sustain a smoking habit in london these days   bad news for brain work   it's good news for breathing  oh    breathing  breathing's boring   is that   three patches   it's a three patch problem   well      you asked me to come  i'm assuming it's important   oh   yeah  of course  can i borrow your phone   my phone  always a chance that my number will be recognised  it's on the website   mrs hudson's got a phone  yeah  she's downstairs   i tried shouting but she didn't hear  i was the other side of london     there was no hurry   here     so what's this about   the case   her case    her case  her suitcase  yes  obviously   the murderer took her suitcase  first big mistake   ok  he took her case  so   it's no use  there's no other way  we'll have to risk it   on my desk there's a number  i want you to send a text   you've brought me here    to send a text   text  yes  the number on my desk   what's wrong  just met a friend of yours   a friend  an enemy   oh  which one   well  your arch enemy  according to him  do people have arch enemies   did he offer you money to spy on me   yes  did you take it   no  pity  we could have split the fee  think it through next time   who is he  the most dangerous man you've ever met  and not my problem right now   on my desk  the number   jennifer wilson  that was     hang on  wasn't that the dead woman   yes  that's not important  just enter the number   are you doing it  yes  have you done it   yeah   hang on   these words exactly    what happened at lauriston gardens    i must have blacked out    22 northumberland street   please come   you blacked out   what  no    no   type and send it  quickly   have you sent it  what's the address    that's     that's the pink lady's case  that's jennifer wilson's case   yes  obviously   oh  perhaps i should mention   i didn't kill her  i never said you did   why not  given that text and the fact i have her case it's a perfectly logical assumption   do people usually assume you're the murderer   now and then  yes   ok     how did you get this  by looking   where  the killer must have driven her to lauriston gardens   he could only keep her case by accident if it was in the car   nobody could be seen with this case without drawing attention    particularly a man  which is statistically more likely   so obviously he'd feel compelled to get rid of it   wouldn't have taken him more than five minutes to realise his mistake   i checked every backstreet wide enough for a car five minutes from lauriston gardens   'and anywhere you could dispose of a bulky object without being observed   'took me less than an hour to find the right skip '  pink  you got all that because you realised the case would be pink   it had to be pink  obviously  why didn't i think of that  because you're an idiot   no  no  no  don't look like that  practically everyone is   now  look  do you see what's missing   from the case  how could i   her phone  where's her mobile phone   there was no phone on the body  there's no phone in the case   we know she had one  you just texted it   maybe she left it at home   she has a string of lovers and she's careful about it  she never leaves her phone at home   er     why did i just send that text   well  the question is where is her phone now   she could have lost it  yes  or   the murderer    you think the murderer has the phone   maybe she   left it when she left her case  maybe he took it from her for some reason   either way  the balance of probability is the murderer has her phone   sorry   what are we doing   did i just text a murderer  what good will that do   text message alert  a few hours after his last victim   and now he receives a text that can only be from her   if somebody had just found that phone they'd ignore a text like that  but the murderer     would panic   have you talked to the police  four people are dead  there isn't time   so why are you talking to me   mrs hudson took my skull   so i'm basically filling in for your skull   relax  you're doing fine   well  well  what  well   you could just sit there and   watch telly   what  you want me to come with you  i like company when i go out  and i think better when i talk aloud   the skull just attracts attention  so     problem  yeah  sergeant donovan   what about her   she said     you get off on this  you enjoy it   and i said  dangerous   and here you are   damn it   where are we going  northumberland street's a five minute walk from here   you think he's stupid enough to go there  no   i think he's brilliant enough   i love the brilliant ones  they're all so desperate to get caught   why  appreciation   applause  at long last the spotlight   that's the frailty of genius  john  it needs an audience  yeah   this is his hunting ground  right here in the heart of the city   now that we know his victims were abducted  that changes everything   because all of his victims disappeared from busy streets   crowded places  but nobody saw them go   think  who do we trust  even though we don't know them   who passes unnoticed wherever they go   who hunts in the middle of a crowd   don't know  who   haven't the faintest  hungry   thank you  billy    keep your eyes on it   he's not just going to ring the doorbell  he'd need to be mad   he has killed four people   ok   sherlock   anything on the menu  whatever you want  free   on the house  for you and for your date   do you want to eat  i'm not his date   this man got me off a murder charge   this is angelo  three years ago i proved to lestrade at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder  that angelo was elsewhere  house breaking   he cleared my name  i cleared it a bit  anything happening opposite   nothing   but for this man  i'd have gone to prison  you did go to prison   i'll get a candle for the table  it's more romantic   i'm not his date   you may as well eat  we might have a long wait   thanks   people don't have arch enemies   i'm sorry  in real life   there are no arch enemies in real life  doesn't

girlfriends  boyfriends  yes  well  as i was saying   dull   you don't have a girlfriend  then   girlfriend  no  not really my area   mm   oh  right   do you have a   boyfriend  which is fine  by the way   i know it's fine   so you've got a boyfriend then  no   right  ok   you're unattached  like me   fine  good   john  erm     i think you should know that i consider myself married to my work

welcome to london   er  any problems   just let us know   basically just a cab that happened to slow down  basically   not the murderer  not the murderer  no   wrong country  good alibi   as they go  hey  where did you get this   detective inspector lestrade  yeah   i pickpocket him when he's annoying   you can keep that one  i've got plenty at the flat   what  nothing  just    welcome to london    he sniggers  got your breath back  ready when you are   john pants ok     that was ridiculous   that was the most ridiculous thing   i've ever done   and you invaded afghanistan  they laugh  that wasn't just me   why aren't we back at the restaurant   they can keep an eye out   it was a long shot anyway   so what were we doing there   oh  just passing the time   and proving a point   what point  you   mrs hudson  dr watson will take the room upstairs   says who   says the man at the door   knocking  sherlock texted me  he said you forgot this   ah     er  thank you   thank you   sherlock  what have you done   mrs hudson  upstairs   what are you doing  well  i knew you'd find the case  i'm not stupid   you can't just break into my flat  you can't withhold evidence   and i didn't break in   well  what do you call this then   it's a drugs bust  seriously  this guy   a junkie   have you met him  john     you could search this flat all day  you wouldn't find anything you could call recreational   john  you probably want to shut up now  but come on     no    what   you  shut up  i'm not your sniffer dog   no  anderson's my sniffer dog   anderson  what are you doing here on a drugs bust   oh  i volunteered  they all did  they're not strictly speaking on the drug squad  but they're very keen   are these human eyes  put those back   they were in the microwave  it's an experiment   keep looking  guys   or you could help us properly and i'll stand them down   this is childish  well  i'm dealing with a child   sherlock  this is our case  i'm letting you in  but you do not go off on your own   clear  what   so you set up a pretend drugs bust to bully me   it stops being pretend if we find anything  i am clean   is your flat     all of it   don't even smoke   neither do i   so let's work together   we've found rachel  who is she   jennifer wilson's only daughter   her daughter   why would she write her daughter's name  why   never mind that  we found the case   according to someone the murderer has the case  and we found it in the hands of our favourite psychopath   i'm a high functioning sociopath  do your research   you need to bring rachel in and i need to question her   she's dead  excellent  how  when and why  is there a connection  there has to be   well  i doubt it  since she's been dead for 14 years  technically she was never alive   rachel was jennifer wilson's stillborn daughter  14 years ago   no  that's       that's not right  how     why would she do that  why   why would she think of her daughter in her last moments  yup   sociopath  i'm seeing it now   she didn't think about her daughter   she scratched her name on the floor with her fingernails  she was dying   it took effort  it would have hurt   you said that the victims all took the poison themselves  that he makes them take it    well  maybe he   i don't know  talks to them  maybe he used the death of her daughter somehow   yeah  but that was ages ago  why would she still be upset   not good   bit not good  yeah   if you were dying    if you'd been murdered   in your very last few seconds what would you say    please  god  let me live   use your imagination   i don't have to   yeah  but if you were clever    jennifer wilson running all those lovers   she was clever   she's trying to tell us something   isn't the doorbell working  your taxi's here  sherlock   i didn't order a taxi  go away  oh  dear  they're making such a mess  what are they looking for   it's a drugs bust  mrs hudson   but they're just for my hip  they're herbal soothers     shut up  everybody  don't speak  don't breathe  i'm trying to think   anderson  face the other way  you're putting me off   what  my face is everybody quiet and still   anderson  turn your back  oh  for god's sake   your back  now  please   come on  think  quick  what about your taxi   mrs hudson   oh     ah   she was clever  clever  yes   she's cleverer than you lot and she's dead  do you see  do you get it   she didn't lose her phone  she never lost it  she planted it on him   when she got out of the car  she knew that she was going to her death   she left the phone in order to lead us to her killer  but how   what do you mean  how   rachel   don't you see  rachel   oh     look at you lot  you're all so vacant   is it nice not being me  it must be so relaxing   rachel is not a name   then what is it  john   on the luggage  there's a label   e mail address   er  jennie pink mephone org uk   she didn't have a laptop  which means she did her business on her phone  a smartphone  it's e mail enabled   so there was a website for her account   the username is her e mail address   and all together  the password is   rachel  so we can read her e mails  so what   anderson  don't talk out loud  you lower the iq of the whole street   we can do much more than that  it's a smartphone  it's got gps   which means if you lose it you can locate it online  she's leading us directly to the man who killed her   unless he got rid of it  we know he didn't   come on  come on  quickly  sherlock  dear  this taxi driver     mrs hudson  isn't it time for your evening soother   get vehicles  get a helicopter  this phone battery won't last for ever   we'll just have a map reference  not a name  it's a start   sherlock    narrows it down from just anyone in london   it's the first proper lead that we've had  sherlock     where is it  quickly  where   here  it's   in 221 baker street   how can it be here   how   maybe it was in the case when you brought it back and it   fell out somewhere   what  and i didn't notice it  me   i didn't notice   anyway  we texted him and he called back   guys  we're also looking for a mobile somewhere here   belonged to the victim    'who do we trust  even if we don't know them   'who passes unnoticed wherever they go   'who hunts in the middle of a crowd '  text message alert  sherlock  you ok  what      yeah  yeah    i'm fine   so  how can the phone be here   don't know   i'll try it again  good idea   where are you going   fresh air  just popping outside for a moment  won't be long   you sure you're all right  i'm fine   taxi for sherlock holmes   i didn't order a taxi   doesn't mean you don't need one   you're the cabbie   the one who stopped outside northumberland street   it was you  not your passenger   see  no one ever thinks about the cabbie   it's like you're invisible   just the back of an 'ead   proper advantage for a serial killer   is this a confession  oh  yeah   i'll tell you what else     if you call the coppers now  i won't run   i'll sit quiet and they can take me down  i promise   why   cos you're not going to do that  am i not   i didn't kill those four people  mr holmes   i spoke to 'em     and they killed themselves   if you get the coppers now  i'll promise you one thing   i will never tell you what i said   no one else will die  though  and i believe they call that a result   and you won't ever understand how those people died   what kind of result do you care about   if i wanted to understand       what would i do  let me take you for a ride   so you can kill me too  i don't want to kill you  mr holmes   i'm going to talk to ya       and then you're going to kill yourself   door opens and closes  engine starts  he just got in a cab    it's sherlock  he just drove off in a cab   i told you  he does that   he bloody left again   we're wasting our time   i'm   calling the phone  it's ringing out   phone rings  phone keeps ringing  phone keeps ringing  and if it's ringing  it's not here   i'll try the search again  does it matter  does any of it   he's just a lunatic  and he'll always let you down  and you're wasting your time  all our time   ok  everybody     done here   how did you find me   oh  i recognised ya   soon as i saw you chasing my cab   sherlock holmes   i was warned about you   i've been on your website  too  brilliant stuff  loved it   who warned you about me  just someone out there who's noticed   who   who would notice me   you're too modest  mr holmes  i'm really not   got yourself a fan   tell me more   that's all you're going to know   in this lifetime   why did he do that  why did he have to leave   you know him better than i do   i've known him for five years   and no  i don't   so why do you put up with him   because i'm desperate  that's why   and because sherlock holmes is a great man    and i think one day  if we're very  very lucky   he might even be a good one   where are we   you know every street in london  you know exactly where we are   roland kerr further education college   why here  it's open   cleaners are in   one thing about being a cabbie   you always know a nice quiet spot for a murder   i'm surprised more of us don't branch out   and you just walk your victims in  how   oh    dull   don't worry  it gets better   you can't make people take their own lives at gunpoint  i don't   it's much better than that   don't need this with you  cos you'll follow me   beep  continued beeping  well  what do you think   it's up to you   you're the one who's going to die here   no  i'm not  that's what they all say   shall we talk   bit risky  wasn't it   took me away under the eye of about half a dozen policemen   they're not that stupid   and mrs hudson will remember you   you call that a risk  nah     this is a risk   oh  i like this bit   cos you don't get it yet  do ya   but you're about to   i just have to do this     weren't expecting that  were ya   oh  you're going to love this   love what  sherlock holmes  look at you   here in the flesh  that website of yours  your fan told me about it   my fan   you are brilliant   you are a proper genius   the science of deduction  now  that     is proper thinking   between you and me sitting here  why can't people think   don't it make you mad   why can't people just think   oh  i see    so you're a proper genius too   don't look it  do i   funny little man driving a cab   but you'll know better in a minute   chances are it'll be the last thing you ever know   ok  two bottles  explain   there's a good bottle and a bad bottle   you take the pill from the good bottle  you live   you take the pill from the bad bottle   you die   both bottles are of course identical  in every way   and you know which is which  of course i know  but i don't   wouldn't be a game if you knew  you're the one who chooses   why should i  i've got nothing to go on  what's in it for me   i haven't told you the best bit yet   whatever bottle you choose   i take the pill from the other one   and then together     we take our medicine   i won't cheat  it's your choice   i'll take whatever pill you don't   didn't expect that  did you  mr holmes   this is what you did to the rest of them    you gave them a choice  and now i'm giving you one   you take your time   get yourself together   i want your best game  it's not a game  it's chance   i've played four times  i'm alive   it's not chance  mr holmes  it's chess   it's a game of chess   with one move   and one survivor   and this   this     is the move   did i just give you the good bottle or the bad bottle   you can choose either one   no  detective inspector lestrade   i need to speak to him   it's important  it's an emergency   er  left here  please  left here     you ready yet  mr holmes   ready to play  play what  it's a 50 50 chance   you're not playing the numbers  you're playing me   did i just give you the good pill or the bad pill   is it a bluff   or a double bluff   or a triple bluff  it's still just chance   four people  in a row  it's not chance   luck  it's genius   i know how people think   i know how people think i think   i can see it all like a map inside my head   everyone's so stupid  even you   or maybe god just loves me   either way  you're wasted as a cabbie   so     you risked your life four times just to kill strangers  why   time to play   oh  i am playing   this is my turn   there's shaving foam behind your left ear  nobody's pointed it out to you   traces of where it's happened before  so obviously you live on your own   there's no one to tell you   but there's a photograph of children  their mother's been cut out   if she'd died  she'd still be there   the photograph's old  but the frame's new   you think of your children  but you don't get to see them   estranged father   she took the kids   but you still love them and it still hurts   ah  but there's more   your clothes  recently laundered   but everything you're wearing is at least   three years old   keeping up appearances  but not planning ahead   and here you are on a kamikaze murder spree  what's that about   ah     three years ago  is that when they told you   told me what   that you're a dead man walking  so are you   you don't have long  though   am i right   aneurism  right in 'ere   any breath could be my last   and because you're dying  you've just murdered four people   i've outlived four people   that's the most fun you can have with an aneurism   no    no  there's something else   you didn't just kill four people because you're bitter  bitterness is a paralytic   love is a much more vicious motivator   somehow  this is about your children   oh     you are good  in't ya  but how   when i die they won't get much  my kids   not a lot of money in driving cabs   or serial killing  you'd be surprised   surprise me   i have a sponsor   you have a what  for every life i take  money goes to my kids   the more i kill    the better off they'll be   you see  it's nicer than you think   who'd sponsor a serial killer   who'd be a fan of sherlock holmes   you're not the only one to enjoy a good murder   there's others out there just like you  except you're just a man   and they're so much more than that   what do you mean     more than a man   an organisation     what   there's a name  that no one says   and i'm not going to say it either   now  enough chatter   time to choose   sherlock    sherlock   what if i don't choose either  i could just walk out of here   you can take a 50 50 chance   or i can shoot you in the head   funnily enough   no one's ever gone for that option   i'll have the gun  please   are you sure   definitely  the gun   you don't want to phone a friend  the gun   i know a real gun when i see one   none of the others did  clearly   well  this has been very interesting   i look forward to the court case   just before you go  did you figure it out   which one's the good bottle   course  child's play   well  which one  then   which one would you have picked   just so i know whether i could have beaten you   come on   play the game   oh   interesting   so what do you think   shall we   really    what do you think   can you beat me   are you clever enough       to bet your life   faintly  sherlock   i bet you get bored  don't you   i know you do   a man like you  so clever   but what's the point of being clever if you can't prove it   still the addict   but this   this is what you're really addicted to   you'll do anything       anything at all  to stop being bored   you're not bored now  are ya   isn't it good   gunshot  cabbie gasps  was i right   i was  wasn't i   did i get it right    ok    tell me this   your sponsor  who was it   the one who told you about me  my fan   i want a name   no     you're dying  but there's still time to hurt you   give me   a name   he gasps  a name  now   the name   he gasps moriarty   sirens wail  why have i got this blanket  they keep putting this blanket on me   yeah  it's for shock  i'm not in shock   yeah  but some of the guys want to take photographs   so  the shooter  no sign   cleared off before we got here  but a guy like that would have had enemies  i suppose   one of them could have been following him  but     we've got nothing to go on   oh  i wouldn't say that   ok  give me   the bullet they just dug out of the wall's from a handgun   a kill shot over that distance  that's a crack shot  but not just a marksman  a fighter   his hands couldn't have shaken at all so clearly he's acclimatised to violence   he didn't fire until i was in immediate danger though  so strong moral principle   you're looking for a man probably with a history of military service  and     nerves of steel     actually  do you know what  ignore me  sorry  ignore all of that   it's just the er   the shock talking   where are you going  i just need to   talk about the rent   i've still got questions  what now  i'm in shock   look  i've got a blanket   sherlock  and  i just caught you a serial killer    more or less   ok  we'll pull you in tomorrow  off you go   erm   sergeant donovan has    just been explaining everything   the two pills     dreadful business  isn't it  dreadful   good shot   yes  yes  must have been  through that window  well  you'd know   need to get the powder burns out of your fingers   i don't suppose you'd serve time for this  but let's avoid the court case   are you all right  yes  of course i'm all right   well  you have just killed a man  yes     that's true  isn't it   but he wasn't a very nice man   no  no  he wasn't  really  was he  frankly a bloody awful cabbie   sherlock chuckles that's true  he was a bad cabbie   you should have seen the route he took us to get here   stop it  we can't giggle  it's a crime scene  stop it   well  you're the one who shot him  keep your voice down   sorry  it's just erm    nerves  i think  sorry   you were going to take that damn pill  weren't you  course i wasn't   biding my time  knew you'd turn up   no  you didn't   that's how you get your kicks  isn't it   you risk your life to prove you're clever   why would i do that  because you're an idiot   dinner  starving   end of baker street there's a good chinese  stays open till two   you can tell a good chinese by the bottom third of the door handle   sherlock    that's him  that's the man i was talking to you about   i know exactly who that is   so    another case cracked   how very public spirited   though that's never really your motivation  is it   what are you doing here   as ever  i'm concerned about you   yes  i've been hearing about your  concern    always so aggressive   did it never occur to you that you and i belong on the same side   oddly enough   no   we have more in common than you'd like to believe   this petty feud between us is simply childish   people will suffer  and you know how it always upset mummy   i upset her   me   it wasn't me that upset her  mycroft   no

secret service  or the cia on a freelance basis   good evening  mycroft  try not to start a war before i get home   you know what it does for the traffic   so  when you say you're concerned about him   you actually are concerned   yes  of course   i mean  it actually is a childish feud   he's always been so resentful   you can imagine the christmas dinners  yeah     no    god  no   i'd better erm
