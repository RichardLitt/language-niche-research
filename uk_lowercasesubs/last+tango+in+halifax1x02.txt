daughter strikes me as being a bit high maintenance  though   she stood you up   apparently not  she had you on then   how do you know she's not having you on now   what happened was    and that bloody daughter   oh  don't get me    started  trailer trash   what happened was    bitch   what happened was    dad  don't want to know how she's twisted it  and tried to make you believe black's white  cos you know what happened  you told me   i'll tell you later   you needn't bother   see you  ditto   so  you were indiscreet with michael bloody dobson   what did you say to him  i was just a bit tearful   i was hiding in the book room and he came in   yes  and what did you say to him  he asked me why i was    and i said  because i'd been seeing somebody and that that somebody had dumped me   and then i accidentally said  she  instead of  he    and he said   oh  god  is it someone from here    and he wouldn't let it drop after that   did you say my name  look     did you say my name  yes   what exactly did you tell him   just     you're going to have to say it   that we kissed twice   look  he's a mate  i wouldn't have told him otherwise   he's not going to say anything  are you cross   no   hello   'good morning '  i thought i might pop over   yoo hoo  oh     is anybody in   celia  john  are you busy   i've just got to the bit where prothero  that's the main central

that i've moved back in   yeah  yeah  she did   good   the thing is  it's delicate   yeah   oh  i made a mistake  celia  i should never have left her   i've made such a bloody mess of things   she's put me in the spare room  which is fine  you know   it's    it's     the thing is  obviously  if you felt inclined   if    if you could put in a good word     for me    with her  you see  she listens to you   huh  when   no  she does   happen once a flood  if it suits her   i just want everything to get back to normal  celia   what do you think about my news  what news   me and alan   celia's rung  fan belt's gone again   she's popping over  when  now   what for  well  because there's stuff to discuss   raff came home from school yesterday     asking questions about when eddie died   what sort of questions   oh     why yesterday   because robbie turned up outside the school   saying stuff  what stuff   the usual crap   but what if he gets it into his head to start talking about     other things  like     what really happened   he wouldn't be that daft  surely   robbie   he'll have messed with raffy's head more than yours  surely   he knows that   i don't think he cogitates that far  dad   she actually coming here  specifically   as opposed to  you know  here in general   yeah  yes  here   cos you do realise  to fresh eyes  the place does look like a dump   caroline   i've got your husband on the phone  he says it's urgent   put him through   john   you didn't tell me your ma's getting married   something happened  'yeah '  your mother's getting married   sorry  is this urgent  it's delightful   it's nonsense  it won't happen  they    you know what she's like   it    she's all for something one minute   then half an hour  ten minutes later  she's gone completely off it   it's like when she wanted to    buy a fax machine  'well  i don't know '  she's driving over to halifax to see him   when  'now '  she's picked up a little hire car   my mother has hired a car   well  no  it's a little courtesy car   look    god  she'll get lost   no  it's got a little sat nav thingy on it    in it   'and the bloke showed her how it works so   '  did she take her mobile   i don't know  probably   don't you think it's     what  'i don't know '  life affirming  properly  you know  proper   uplifting  good   what it's all for  really   caroline   i don't know   i don't know  look  i've got to go  do you want to go out for dinner tonight   i    no   someone at the door  i'd better go   bye  bye  bye   judith   hello  michael  could i     see you  yes  of course   beverley's there if you want an appointment   i meant  er     now   what's it about  well     it's     sure   kate  kate   what about her   she has    been saying things   things that perhaps you ought to be aware of   ok  so     she implied     hmm  she said   and  you see  it's not just me that she may be saying these things to   and    it could be damaging     to you if any governors  or parents  et cetera   or    or     one of your two boys     even   for instance   got wind of     what do you want  michael   bigger budget for your hands across europe project   head of department when mrs aspinall moves on   look    i can be    discreet   sod off  you little prick  do you really think you can humiliate me   go for it  genius  spread a few rumours   it'll say more about you than it ever will about me  this is 2012   i'm single  she's single  we're adults   we had a fling  the ladies have landed   quite a long time ago  in fact  get over it   she spoke to you because she was upset  and this is how you respond   bad move  and shame on you  as well   leave the door open on your way out   psss choo   did i really hurt you  yeah   god  that's appalling   yeah   did it hurt   i suppose  sorry  doesn't even start to     well  you know  it's complex  i understand that   judith  i'm not entirely comfortable about you being here in caroline's kitchen   why  is she here  no  of course not  she's at work   no one's here  it is your kitchen  though  isn't it   as much as it is hers  you take the point   i want you to come back  no   i don't want to be like this any more   well  yes  of course you don't  and you shouldn't  but     judith  i'd have left anyway   why  because it had run its course   you think you can just pick people up like that  and then just drop them   well  certainly when people start hitting people  yes   it makes it more of an option   why have you come back here  we went through this   did we  it's where i belong   you always said it stifled you   i think i've come full circle with caroline   i don't get it  because we were so good and happy and exciting together   and you like a drink just as much as i do   not    quite as much as you do   i just     i just don't know what i've got to look forward to  john   i'm serious   i'm 43 years old   and    i'm between jobs   and my life just lurches from one embarrassing mishap to

right  enjoy  ta ra   ha   oh     hello   i lay awake half the night  wondering if i'd dreamt it   so did i  did you   well  no  it were more laying awake wondering if i'd got the wrong end of the stick   i tidied up   you've got a lovely view   oh  it's bitter in winter   have you given any thought as to where we might live   we've a few options  there's my little house up barkisland   there's my flat at caroline's   then there's here  there's room  oh   would your gillian like that  oh  aye   i have money in the farm  so she couldn't really object   not that she would  well  i'm the same   they'd never have been able to buy that big house in harrogate without my input   if we did want to live in my little house   i'd have to give darren and kimberley a month's notice     the tenants   which i'd do  but they've just had a baby   oh   what were you saying about car insurance on the phone   oh  well   what steve said  steve at the garage     what's he got to do with insurance  oh  nothing   he was just saying that because i drove into the back of your vehicle   at my age  not only might they bump up my premiums   they might refuse to insure me altogether another time   it's my only little bit of independence  this driving   so  i was wondering     i won't claim   i mean  i will pay for the damage  no  you won't   oh  i will  do you fancy arguing about it   over lunch  out   gillian says we can take the land rover  she doesn't need it this aft'   or there's my little courtesy car   we have too many decisions  we're spoilt for choice   well  i've never been in a land rover   oh  it's right uncomfortable     no  sir  i could tear apart mcs    but i'd rather read a book on childcare by kerry katona    no niceness  cos i ran out of it dumb it down a bit    ain't something i'm prepared to do    cos i ain't ever gonna run out of lip    here's something       ooh   i tell you what  gillian   there's something about you bending over in a field  that makes me almost unable to contain myself   piss off  paul   you give the nod  and i'll be over this wall and up behind you before you can say    you ought to be posing in magazines with one that size  paul    move along now   i keep hoping you'll text me   how weird  you know you like it   there anybody in at your house   why  got a half hour   ain't that your land rover   half an hour   of course  there is another option   is there  yeah   when we're married  we won't need both cars  will we   so  why don't we trade them both in and buy something we've always fancied   well  did you have summat in mind  yeah   i daren't tell you what  you'll think i'm crackers   hello  are you the taxi   dad  dad   what  yes   shit  william   er    this is    what are you    what are you doing here at this time   revision

because  honestly  i was     i was just trying to get rid of her  william   was caroline all right when you drove home last night   caroline  yeah   yes  i think so   she seemed preoccupied  she always is   i suppose it was a bit of a shock for 'em both   i don't think caroline's happy   what  about us  about anything   she's married to this    john   oh  he can be quite entertaining but he's a complete waste of space   he works at the university in york   when it suits him   and he writes novels   published  but     they're nowt   he went off with another woman   judith   so  caroline was working full time and bringing up two boys on her own   and then he just waltzes back in  and she lets him   you can't say anything   no  the fella our gillian was married to  eddie  he was a wrong 'un   was he   dead ten years  but he still manages to do her head in   how  ooh   you know i said he died in an accident on the farm   yeah   well  it wasn't an accident   he killed himself   oh  no  volatile   drank too much  always short of money  she thought the world of him   i could see why people were drawn to him  but i never was   he was a bully  yeah  and a coward   still  he's not there now   so     but the lad doesn't know   we always let him believe that it was an accident   you being seen to  er    i  um     yeah  we'd like to test drive this car  please   what  now  er    ideally  yes   right  ok  yeah  and    and are you looking to buy   yeah  th that    that's the idea   and is it part exchange  yes  yes  that    that's the plan   ok  mr and mrs     what makes you think we're married   er     ow   right   come on   bugger off   yeah   till next time   you twat   it was unfortunate yesterday  i think   our gillian and your caroline seemed to get off on the wrong foot   he thinks we're time wasters   who does  yond   happen if we had a little do  like a little engagement     well  they'd be forced to speak to each other   they'd rise to the occasion   well  why not   it's always nice to have an excuse for a party   why would we waste his time   he thinks we're silly old buggers who've nothing better to do of an afternoon   well  happen we should invite him   that'd guarantee it'd go with a right swing   him and his face  ey up   so  mrs dawson     i spoke to steve in harrogate   and based on what he's telling me  minus the cost of the damage   we can offer you 5 500 part ex on your a class  so you'd be looking to pay       you still want a test drive   it's 10 750 each   it depends   on what   on if you can give it to me for 21   and if you can have it ready for saturday afternoon   only it's our engagement party   mum  where are you   'are you all right ' yeah  i'm with alan in halifax  'what '  what are you doing in halifax  nothing   are you all right  yeah  never better   right  well  er    drive carefully   yeah  i will  bye bye  bye   bye bye   i've put the kettle on  i saw you pulling in   hello  what you been up to   um    nothing   hey  who was that you were chatting to this morning   oh  paul jatri  i made a cake   oh  susan jatri's lad  it's coffee and walnut   yeah  yeah   isn't he getting married to neil cresswell's girl   i believe so  oh  it looks lovely   we got off on the wrong foot yesterday  celia   i'm sorry  oh  no  love  it wasn't your fault   no  i meant more me and caroline got off on the wrong foot   and i'm sorry   i shouldn't have pulled into that parking space  because she was indicating   only i    i was panicking  wondering if he  my dad  was all right and     perhaps you could tell her that i'm sorry and that i apologise  and obviously it'd be nice if we could put it behind us   given the    of course i will    situation  yeah   good  hey  we were thinking about having  um  a little engagement do   great  where  here   on saturday  this saturday   fantastic   and  look     congratulations  i should have said it yesterday   but  you know  it was just     so unexpected   i'll get the     drive safely   so  what have you been up to  nothing   i've been thinking   happen i ought to tell raff     about eddie   happen it's time  and then he knows   and i won't be terrified  about him hearing it  like a sledgehammer  from anyone else   what   no   i think you're wise   i'm cooking  no shit  sherlock   how    how    how were the inspectors   good  very good   good  so they should be   how was your history paper   you all right   yup   now  mum has got some news for everyone  what   have i  you're not pregnant  oh  don't be stupid  i'm 45   what  then  what news   celia  oh  granny's getting married   how  to alan  who   apparently  it won't happen   not an accident   that's what t'coroner said   why did he     obviously that's something i've thought about     a lot   but you know what  at the end of the day   you can never know why somebody gets that far down the line   not if they won't talk about it   even someone you're that close to   we all have demons   and most people     cope with them  put up with them   demons   things about ourselves that we don't like   can't cope with   things we've done   how we've behaved   well  you know he had a temper and     he had a lot of wonderful things about him  your dad  he really did   but he had this darker side as well and     but you mustn't worry about it   you're not like him  not in that respect   you're much more like my dad   you're kind   thoughtful   balanced   you all right   i didn't want you hearing it from robbie  that's all   and  you see     that's another reason robbie doesn't like accepting what really happened   he thought the world of eddie   his big brother   and eddie left him behind   we're having a little do next saturday   you know  like an engagement party   at gillian and alan's house    farm  and everyone's invited   come in and sit down   why are you rushing into this   i suppose that's what it must seem like to you   well  how else could it seem to anyone   i've been in love with him for 60 years   that's not rushing   he was 16 the last time you saw him   people    alter   how do you know  just on a practical level     mm    how much money he's got  for instance   oh  he's not badly off   he has a pension from the company that he worked for   he was a floor manager at jessops chemicals in huddersfield   ok  good   he owns his own house  which he rents out and has an income from   and he put quite a bit of money in the farm   he's not short  i'm not daft  oh  mum  i know that   you've never been daft  well  then   well  it's what i want   what i've always wanted   i know him better than i know myself  can you understand that   well  sort of   almost   that's very     what   touching   articulate   just think  if i'd married him and not your dad  i'd have     not have had me   oh  i think i would  i think i'd always have had you   i was just thinking how much happier life would have been   gillian says she's sorry that you and her got off on the wrong foot   and she hopes you can both put it behind you   she's all right  you know  heart's in the right place   she's had things to deal with as well   as well as who    you  you twit     are you ready    hmm   i was    sorry   just wondering  as regards me being in the spare room     and so forth  not that     look  i know    i know it's early days  but   and i'm not suggesting  obviously  that we should have     have    have    sex   yet  well  good   no  but     i did this stupid thing   sorry   i said this stupid thing   when i met gillian  i     i didn't know it was gillian   i had a sort of spat with her before alan introduced us  and i    what  what did you     i called her an idiot and then i     i called her brain dead lowlife trailer trash   she stole my parking space  it wasn't funny   that's what i love about you  you're so     what  snotty and arrogant and glorious   the point is  i'm not looking forward to this party   did you apologise  no  i     ran off when she went to the loo   these things are never as bad as you think they are   no  this    was   damn  i wish i'd been there  i am going to apologise to her   that would be the grown up thing to do   maybe     you could start    sleeping in here     again   tonight  or     so  we're turning left just here  just coming up   well  the sat nav's saying it's in another six miles   yeah  well  take no notice of that  you want to go this way  here   what  this  yes  are you sure   this is the way alan always comes   i think i'd rather do what the sat nav's telling me   well  bugger what the sat nav's telling you  this is it  i'm telling you   ok   i do know what i'm talking about  good   as long as we're going the right way  i feel sick  feel sick or going to be sick   i need a wee  john  there's plastic bag in the pocket at the back of the seat   you'll have to hang on for a wee   oh  shit  oh  mum  can you drive properly   i beg your pardon  i'm not kidding  i'm throwing up   do not throw up  nobody needs to throw up   there is a plastic bag in the pocket  if somebody chooses to look for it properly   why doesn't dad drive  oh  yes  that'll help matters   i have looked for it properly  are you sure this is the right road  celia   um    it had better be  that's all i can say   oh  i think    oh    have you found that bag   there is no bag  there is a bag

you for    everyone   for coming to  er    celebrate with us this    this very happy and unusual event   er    we    we've not fixed a date yet   and  er    we haven't a clue where we might live   but we'll keep you posted  aw   yeah  so    um    i'd just like to     clarify  er     i   i know you think we're daft   we do not  nobody thinks you're daft   no  well  rushing in  then  but  er    celia and i     what happened was  i was stood on a bridge waiting for her  cos we had a date   this is  er   60 years ago  er    in elland   and  you know  this is before we had telephones   and her mother had mixed her dates up and they were already flitted to sheffield  and celia couldn't contact me so she  er    sent a message   a letter via     a friend   um    to say sorry   with a new address that i could write to her   but i    i never got the message   so  um     why   well  cos she didn't give it to me   the friend     yeah    why   just cos     nasty trick   mm  well    who was she   we    we'll find a picture of her and chuck darts at it   it were eileen   my mother   yeah   so  anyway   not that    not that anybody wants to change what's gone   but it's just to illustrate the fact that we're not rushing in   we've always had very     very fond feelings for one another     since all that time ago and     well  nothing's changed   so     that's    god  that's     wow   that's so     god   anyroad  to us   to us   mum   there's a massive red sports car just pulled up outside   looks like it cost about two million quid   oh  that's us   we decided against an engagement ring   so instead we bought a car between us   the sort we've always fancied     yes    whoa ho   look at that   oh   oh  oh  look  oh   grandma   did you know about this   oh  no   oh  beautiful   oh   mr buttershaw  mrs dawson   oh  can we sit in it  granddad   well    yes  of course you can   as long as they're careful  congratulations   stunning  wow   so  you    this is instead of an engagement ring   mm   but you didn't let alan pay for the whole thing   no  i said we bought it between us  hope they're not trailing mud in   so    blimey   how much did it cost  then  dad  yeah  enough   so  just to clarify  you don't know when   or  let's be honest  if you're going to get married  but you've just spent     there is no if    silly money buying a car  that you're going to need a hip replacement to get in and out of   oh  stop being so negative   do you like it  yeah  yeah   i think my mother probably would have liked one and all  dad   now what   afternoon  how do   are they the

he   what stuff   i'm arresting you on suspicion of assault   you're not  you don't have to say anything   but it may harm your defence if you don't mention when questioned  something you later rely on in court   you're not arresting him   he's assaulted someone  he's your nephew   it'll just be a bit of a caution  that's all   inspector hatfield'll just need to have a bit of a word with you   a bit of a caution  yeah   if he was provoked  which it sounds like he was   look  perhaps    should we     should we be getting off  no   no  no  no  look  look  this is celia and alan's little party
