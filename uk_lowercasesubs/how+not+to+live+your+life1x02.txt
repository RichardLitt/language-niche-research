so  to recap     i'm in love with my flatmate  but i never get a second alone with her   oh  that's not her  actually  who is that   morning   oh  yeah  i was feeling down about abby  the girl of my dreams   having a boyfriend   so i went out  got drunk and had sex with a stranger   i dunno why  but i don't feel better   listen  i've got to dash  but i had a really good time last night   we should do it again sometime   what is your number     er      hm   listen  um   i don't think i should give you my number     why    well     i don't think i should give you my number   because you were shit in bed   i work for the government  so i can't have relationships   get out quick   my number's cursed  if you call it  you'll die   because i'm gay  i mean  i wasn't before  but after last night     definitely a gay man now   because i'm in love with someone else   you're in love with someone else   sometimes the truth is the best option   do you always cheat on your girlfriend   oh  she's not my girlfriend   but you're in love   yeah  i've been trying to get her to fall for me for weeks   god  i know about that one   my room mate confessed to being madly in love with me the other week     did he    she   she    yeah  i probably shouldn't have kissed her that night   i just go a bit mental when i'm drunk   hey  maybe you should take my number   i could pop round next week with a bottle of absinthe or samuel buca     yeah    yeah     that'd be fun    yes  it would   when you leave  would you mind popping a sheet over your head    every morning since i moved into my dead nan's house   i wake up to find eddie in the kitchen   that's him there  look  he was my nan's carer   but he still turns up to do errands  even though she's dead   donald danbury  fancy a little drinklette     coffee  tea  tizer    he's weird   what sort of human likes doing things for others   so  drinklette   why do you keep adding ''lette'' on the ends of words   it's just a thing i do   well  stop it  it's annoying me   don't you like to have fun with words sometimes     no    oh   what do you call an omelette  an ''omelettelette''   is this your way of asking me if i'll make you breakfast     yeah    one omelettelette on its way   oh  it's nice and quiet today  isn't it  i'm glad cock face ain't here     who    cock face   you know  abby's boyfriend  karl   don     wotcher  karl    feeling a bit stupid   why  oh  the cock face thing   no  it's just a friendly nickname  you know   like gibbon tits or vagina eyes or  um  twat   it's just  you know  something i do   so  karl     you're here     again   abby never wants to come over to mine   so whenever i wanna see her  i have e here     oh  well  i have the perfect solution    what   dump her   that way you don't

weekend  so you'll have the place to yourselves     ourselves    yeah  you and your boyfriend   he is not my boyfriend   there you go  sexy pants   he's never said that before   there you go  sexy

abide him   well  let's not talk about this right now  thank you     sure you're ok with coming    of course  literally  i can't wait   what are you two planning   we're taking my kids away for the weekend     you've got kids  you never said    the kids i teach at school   god  you're useless  donald   just promise me that you're not going to be on your mobile phone     the whole time we're there    i promise   look  they don't need me at the conference today   and i ran it past suzy last night     what  you're going as well    he's a life saver   there's a dicky tummy bug going around   the teachers are dropping like flies   i nearly had to cancel the trip   abby happens to think men who are good with kids are sexy  don't you  baby     really     well  a bit  yeah   er  i'm just gonna   go   have you got everything that you need   yeah  i've got three pairs of pants and i've brought my trunks   once we hit the road  i'll turn it off  i promise    karl menford speaking     karl  it's suzy    oh  hi  suzy     hello    god  you sound awful     i've got a dicky tummy bug    a dicky tummy bug     you've got to come in to work    what     i'm sorry  yes    but i thought you said it would be ok     it'll be fine    sorry to break it to you   i'm afraid that means you're going to have to come to the conference   there's no way out of it  hang on   get lost   also  your dad said that if you don't come  to the conference  he'll bite your balls off     he said that    i'm sorry  yes   right  ok  yep  yep  yep  bye   what's going down   what's going down   darling     we're meant to be leaving in an hour  how can i find somebody else to come     hmm    they do need me there today  i have to   my dad said he'd bite my balls off if i didn't show       i'll come    i don't think so   they need a responsible adult   oh  you     but it's looking after kids    hey  i love kids     really    yeah  kids   mmm  i just love their innocence   their thick little minds  so easily influenced   sometimes  if i'm walking past a school playground   i'll just stop and watch them play   careful  you can be put on a list for that   bite me  so  what do you reckon   great  it's agreed  i'm coming with   i'll just get dressed   i'll be honest  i hate kids   but this was the only way i could be with abby without cock face there   why don't you introduce yourself   how hard can it be  you've just got to speak to children on their level  without patronizing them   right  shut up  shut up  shut up   right  a    less of the mr danbury bull crap   you can all call me don  or the double d   and two    keep the noise down   see  i went out last night and i got absolutely shit faced   it was a really good night  actually   i got out of it  but now i've got a headache   i feel like puking up my innards   i really wanna just quite frankly kill myself  and your noise isn't helping   so be good little midgets and shush your mouths  good   wow   you got them to be quiet  you're a natural born teacher   well  you know   when you're ready  driver   so after two hours of throwing up my innards  we got to the campsite   and it dawned on me me what we were doing   i've never been one for the outdoors and nature   oh  bollocks  cocking bollocks   um  don     what    remember  there are children here  yeah   oh  yeah  oi  you  you little shit  help me erect my tent     don    what   there are certain words you cannot use in front of the kids   ''erect''  yeah  that's probably a bit iffy nowadays   no  i mean the swearing   i haven't been swearing   that is  this is so knackering   shall we just off to a hotel   argh   hmm  sorry  i didn't realise i was doing it   never mind  but no more from now on  yeah   ok   we're gonna go on a walk soon  do you think you'll be ready   yeah  course  shouldn't take long to put up  should it   and so i spent the afternoon with the kids   i won them over by pretending to fall over   honestly  i was pretending   i was like the teacher they never had   they respected me as an authority figure   and i made them laugh   help me  help   well  kind of   then that night  i finally got abby on her own   this was my chance to charm her  tell her romantic tales   when the lights came back on   i realised it was my nan's batty i'd been groping   it was so embarrassing     don    mmm     oh  i dunno  nothing  don't worry    no  what     you'll get offended    no  i won't     promise    i promise   why do you act like a prick     what     see  you're offended   what do you expect   you called me a prick   no  i said you act like a prick  there is a difference   you know  i think i'm the only person that gets to see the real you   all right  why are you with karl     what has that got to do with it    it's got nothing to do with anything   but i just wanna know  you know  you two are so different  it's weird   mr danbury  i can't sleep   oi  midget  get lost    we're talking here   don  what's up  sammy     i need to

there   just as i was finally making progress with abby   just as i was finally making progress with abby   all right  she called me a prick  but i knew what she was really getting at   and i had to sleep on my own in a tent with strange noises outside   i'm from the city   i'm used to the comforting sounds of car alarms and people screaming  ''help ''  abby   abby   yeah     it's don  don
