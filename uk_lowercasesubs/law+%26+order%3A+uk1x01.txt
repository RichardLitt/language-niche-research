in the criminal justice system  the people are represented  by two separate  yet equally important groups   the police  who investigate crime   and the crown prosecutors  who prosecute the offenders

moi   merci   he's gonna let us in  you speak french   you think i'm some sort of neanderthal   you might have said something before i made a tit of myself   where's the fun in that   hello   someone left in a hurry   i don't blame 'em   ronnie   lovely   fingerprints match one of the sets from the holdall   and here's the murder weapon  the heating system   pumping out carbon monoxide  a death trap  literally   signs of tampering  quite recent   plus  a carbon monoxide alarm set up  ready to go  no batteries   easily removed  if you don't want your neighbours to know what you're up to   thanks  pete  sure   so  what  you reckon a parent gassing their own child   i've seen worse   well  yeah  but   a baby crying   a single mum  two hours' kip a night for six months  easily done  mate   i dunno   whatever happened to motherly love   i'd have thrown myself in front of a speeding lorry for my kids   other days  i'd have happily shook 'em until they rattled   thank you   eight flats in total  four currently unoccupied   right  qui habite a numero trois   monsieur turner   turner  il arrive la   mr turner  all right  lads  what's occurring   ds brooks  this is ds devlin   we're looking for a neighbour of yours  a dionne farrah   why  what's she done   when was the last time you saw her   ah  well  i live on the floor above  so our paths don't really cross   i hear the baby screaming through the floorboards all night  though   he's got a right pair of lungs on him   did she have a husband   i don't think so  not that i saw   no  i think it's just her and the baby   i think she might be a lezzer   a lot of them about  these days  isn't there   not that i mind  as long as they let us have a little watch  eh   how long have you lived here  mr turner   erm    a couple of months   and is the building always this empty   yeah  it is  yeah  a lot of them took the buy out from the landlady   five grand to get out  it's pretty persuasive   don't you qualify   no  no  i'm on the sick  you see  from the post office  er    rsi   but the woman at the letting agency  mrs walters  she took pity on me   she let me have a room  short term only  a generous landlady   three years ago  i couldn't give a flat away   these days  i could have 'em wrestling naked in t'mud to decide who gets them   can't be that many people fighting over that block  surely   regent's quarter  the new st pancras  a proper up and comer   so you got yourself a bargain  oh  yeah   i wish   i only heard about it at the last minute  i got the bid accepted   not realising the buyer had to honour existing contracts and rents   some of those tenants are on fixed contracts for five years   always read the tiny print  gentlemen   but the building's half empty   yeah  well  if we want to renovate  and we do   we have to buy them out of their contracts   which is where we are now   ok  here we are  dionne farrah   resident since 2006  references taken from the previous owner   one from an employer  another from a teacher based in archway   there you go   so what happens to the people who take all the buy outs and can't afford to live in the area any more   they move to areas where they can afford it   oh  right  and when that gets gentrified  where do they go  then   so we don't improve these areas   kings cross has always been a dump  finally  it's improving   that is communities all over the city being displaced   areas change  cities shift  nothing new  been happening for decades   in 20 years' time  when the only gaff you can afford to live in is a caravan  think of me   really  well  that is great  ok  i'll ring you back   please  if you could  bye bye   ok  listen up  dionne farrah made one call from a mobile phone yesterday morning   five hours after the baby's body was found  to a leona collins   leona collins  yeah  wait   wait  wait  wait  leona collins   yes   leona collins was dionne's referee for the flat  admit it  i am good   well  i am better  because leona collins' maiden name was     not farrah  farrah   dionne has a sister  let's go  i'll call you back   i spoke to her a couple of days ago   what about   the usual stuff  sister stuff   and since then  look  i ain't seen her   leona  does dionne have children   a little boy   sean   sean   and how old is sean  nine months   lovely   do you enjoy being an auntie  leona   yeah  i bet   what are you gonna get him for his birthday   you seem the sort of person family means a lot to   the kind of girl that'd like to protect her own   is this your nephew   where's your sister   it's all right  lee  i don't want to hide any more   it's my fault   it's all my fault   so why did you take the batteries from the co alarm  dionne   i didn't   i didn't even know i had one   ok   just talk us through what happened   i had to get to work   i clean offices on pentonville road   i was already late three times in the last month  because of sean   on my last warning   i can't afford to lose the job   what about sean's father   he was killed in a car accident four months before he was born   he never saw sean   do you normally leave sean on his own while you go to work   no   i phoned serena  she's the baby sitter   she said she was like three minutes away  i thought he'd be ok   she said she was on her way   so you left sean in the flat   i got home about midnight   the flat was all dark and no serena   i went over to sean's cot  i leaned in  trying to hear him breathe  but i couldn't   so i reached out  all gently  to touch him  but he wouldn't move   so i picked him up  and he was all     i tried to give him mouth to mouth  but i don't know how to give mouth to mouth properly   i never learnt  i should have learnt  but he wouldn't move  and he's such a light sleeper and i knew then  i knew he was     i took him to the hospital   and you left him at the entrance  i didn't know what i was doing   i just thought it was the best place for him   i couldn't face anyone   all the questions   i knew they'd be thinking the same thing   it's all my fault   she had no intent to kill or cause harm   oh  come on  if you prosecute her  who does it serve   we'll have to see what the cps say  if we play it by the book   she's looking at manslaughter by gross negligence   she was worried about her job  she's got no partner  no support   what would you have done  waited for the baby sitter   dionne said that when she spoke to you  you told her you were three minutes away   i was on the bus   there was this van in the middle of the road   everyone was yelling at the driver   it should have only taken three or four minutes  but     it turned out being about 20   so  why weren't you looking after sean  when dionne got back from work   i never got in  i've only got the key to dionne's flat   they changed the locks on the main door a few weeks back  i never got a copy   the caretaker wouldn't let me in   caretaker  have you seen the state of that place   i told him i'd come to baby sit sean   he said he couldn't let me in  he said he'd never seen me before   i was outside the flat for like half an hour  buzzing other people   waiting for someone to come out   and then the caretaker came out again and said if i didn't go  then he'd call the police   erm  une jeune fille  seize ans   says you wouldn't let her into the building   non  je ne l'ai jamais vue   he says he never saw her  never answered the door to her   well  someone's lying   did you     did you take the batteries out of that   je ne l'ai jamais touche   reckons he never touched it   a lot of  jamais  round here  mate   so who's guilty here   a young mum for leaving her baby  a baby sitter for not doing her job  or that caretaker for not letting her in   if dionne didn't remove those co alarm batteries  it puts her in a different light   yeah  i mean  the building's half empty   look at it   the place is an absolute dump   the gas systems aren't being checked  at all   and the landlady's got her heart set on redevelopment   so what does my devious mind conclude from that little lot   the landlady wants that building cleared of tenants   yeah   the heating engineers who've got the contract for the building   they haven't had a maintenance request in 15 months   they tried to do an annual check  but they couldn't get access   take a trip down to the tenants' ombudsman on the strand   find out if maureen walters has got a record of driving out tenants   hang on  what about dionne  she's the one who left the kid alone   i want to make sure we've explored every avenue before i see a mother accused of the death of her child   maureen walters   the wicked witch of the west  when she had properties in notting hill   we need a new filing cabinet just for her  no water  broken doors   floods  textbook methods of how to empty a place   can you not get mozzarella on the files   so what are you doing to stop her   unless a private landlord is a member of the guild  we don't have jurisdiction   so  you just sit here and watch the complaints pile up   what else can we do  we're an ombudsman  not like you boys   this gaff on hallem street  do you think she's trying to empty it   you're asking me to forego my impartiality   oh  perish the thought   put it this way  i couldn't exclude the possibility that's what's happening   i don't suppose you've got any records of former tenants who tried to lodge complaints   oh  yes   did my head right in  that place   i come home and the lock on my door's been broken   the caretaker is neither use nor ornament   i shove a chair against the door  can't get a locksmith till morning   the middle of the bloody night  smash  the door is off its hinges   that mad git turner is in my lounge   the rsi postie with a lesbian fetish   he's throwing my cds on the floor  switching t'telly on full volume   acting like he's drunk   when you say acting    oh  i know what a pissed bloke smells like   he didn't smell of booze  at all  more like   lynx and mouthwash   turner's a thug   he got what he wanted  i moved out   well done him   i want this thing wrapped up  oh  guv   yes  what have you got  i did a full fiu on the landlady's company   guess what  mike turner is on the payroll  so we checked him out   he's got two previous convictions  one for abh  one for gbh   both on tenants who claim he was harassing them to get them out of their homes   from property records  ex tenants   we reckon this must be the sixth building he's cleared for the company   fine  this makes him a thug  but not a killer   dionne farrah also mentioned that she hadn't messed around with the heating system in her flat   yet the scene of crime officer said it had definitely been tampered with   the maintenance company say a bloke matching turner's description  barred them access to the flats   saying that he was looking after the heating systems   so he sabotages the heating to get the mum out  ends up killing the baby   guv  if mike turner is responsible for the death of this child   we really should be out there  bringing him in   let me talk to james steel from the cps  see if we've got enough for him   it's clear mike turner was harassing tenants   but you've got to show me proof he's responsible for sean's death   at the moment  we can only prove     i don't know  harassment of occupier   or maybe agent of the landlord withholding services from occupier   and what is that  that's like  two years  max  just a fine   i mean  a baby has been gassed to death   i appreciate that and we all want to convict whoever is responsible   but  trust me  at the moment   i just don't have enough to convince a jury of turner's guilt   and if we prosecute him without enough evidence  we won't get justice for sean or his mother   so what do you need   evidence directly linking mike turner's actions to sean's death   you get me that  i'll put him in the dock   this caretaker  daniel matoukou   it must have been his job to service the gas system that killed sean   what's he got to say for himself   well  not a lot  because he barely speaks any english   what is it  matt   i can hear your brain whirring from here   well  the  erm  caretaker   serena said that he threatened to call the police  told her he'd never seen her before   so   well  do you think serena speaks that much french   thank you  serena  that's very helpful   result  she says the man who wouldn't let her in was white  northern and big boned   so  not the caretaker  at all  it was mike turner   he barred her access  just like he barred the maintenance people from checking the heaters   enough of a link   now we can build a case   i said  stop it  leave me alone  you bloody great ape   this wood is rotten  mrs murphy  it needs to be replaced   only after you started hacking away at it   got the cuffs   i've just had that painted   matt  cuffs  get off me   michael turner  i'm arresting you on the manslaughter of sean farrah   you do not have to say anything  but it may harm your defence   if you do not mention  when questioned  something which you later rely on in court   dionne  we've arrested mike turner   we believe the owners of the building are trying to harass the tenants by damaging the heating systems   you mean  they did it on purpose   they killed my boy   i'm so sorry  dionne   throwing old ladies and young mothers onto the street to make a few quid   this mike turner is below amoeba   unlawful act manslaughter  that's what i'm going for   i don't see it  where's the unlawful act   the law requires that landlords service gas systems and have them safety checked annually   the tests on the system found the co levels were more than  the health and safety executive's safety level is 50   statistics  blind me with science  i couldn't give a rat's backside   you have to convince me of intent   that turner essentially knew that what he was doing was unlawful   a big loophole for him to dance through   turner intended to make the conditions unliveable  so that the tenants would leave   he's done this half a dozen times before   if i get his previous convictions admitted  the context is clear   you'll need a judge and jury in generous moods   we've got good evidence  enough of it   we need direct evidence that turner tampered with the gas system   without it  i'm not convinced   what if we turn the caretaker  daniel matoukou  to give evidence against turner   mr matoukou knew the gas system was unreliable  he knew the co alarms weren't functioning properly   but he didn't try to get them repaired or serviced   oh  come on  he's just the caretaker   someone will take responsibility for this baby's death   either he tells us about mike turner or we charge him with manslaughter   scale his charge down to withholding services from a tenant  a summary offence only   then he'll talk   who tampered with the gas system   mike turner   unlawful act manslaughter   what's the matter with you  huge credibility problems here   any jury with half a brain cell between them  will see that matoukou is simply trying to shift blame onto mr turner   he is the caretaker  the building and services are his responsibility   nothing to do with us whatsoever   mr turner is an habitual offender   one previous conviction for gbh  one for abh  both against tenants   i reckon a jury will be fascinated by his previous convictions   you've been sniffing the tipp ex  no judge will allow that   take up golf  james  a better use of your energies   come along  mr turner   see you in court   you can't allow this  my lady  it's totally prejudicial   the cases are identical   mr turner assaulted tenants who were trying to repair essential services   assaults on people  not tampering with gas systems   entirely different  my lady   yes  thank you  mr ridley   let me get this clear   making the buildings unliveable is intent to cause injury   that's what's common to all these incidents   yes  thank you  my lady   you're not going to allow this   do you know  i think i am   it's a novel theory and i rather like it   mr turner's previous convictions may be admitted as evidence   i tried to push past   but he wasn't having any of it   he just slammed the door in my face   i tried to get in   i really did  i adored sean   if i'd known what was gonna happen  i     the man who blocked your access to the building   is he in this court   that's him   he said he'd never seen me before  but i've been there loads of times   for the record  the witness was pointing at the defendant   no further questions   miss jackson    may i call you serena   serena  you told the police that mr turner was the caretaker   that's right   but he's not   if you'd been there so often  why didn't you know that   he was around a lot   i just assumed   so you didn't really know who he was   is it possible  therefore  that he didn't know who you were   j'ai dit a monsieur turner que je voulais reparer le reseau de gas de mademoiselle farrah   i told mr turner i was trying to fix miss farrah's gas system   and what did mr turner do  qu'a fait monsieur turner   il m'a dit de laisser tomber  he told me to leave it   il m'a ordonne de m'ecarter du systeme de gas   he pulled me away  et puis il a donne un coup de marteau dessus   and then he gave it a thump with a hammer   as the level of carbon monoxide in the room increased   the child would have suffered from cerebral oedema   can you explain what that is  please  mr stanton   cerebral oedema causes brain cells to crush into each other   through swelling   essentially killing the cells as they're compacted   could the carbon monoxide leak have been caused by a source  other than the gas heating system   i don't believe so   and  in your expert opinion  would mr turner's attack on the gas system  have increased the chances of such a fatal leak   in my opinion  yes   thank you  no further questions   i don't know if i can do this   all those people looking at me   this is your chance to tell everyone the truth  dionne   i dreamt of sean last night   he was asleep in the cot next to me   like none of this had happened   when i woke up       it was like i was losing him all over again   i thought sean would only be on his own for five minutes at most   i thought     i thought he'd be fine   how long was sean alone   seven hours   when you left   did you notice anything unusual about the air in the room   no   and when you returned   it was like     thick   i opened the window  before i       saw sean   thank you   no further questions   this must be very distressing  miss farrah  i'll be brief   can you just explain to the court  why you didn't phone home  to check with miss jackson that everything was all right   we're not allowed phones at work   two months back  one of the cleaners got sacked for making calls during work time   you don't have breaks  i went to my locker to get my phone   it had run out of battery  i must have left it on   so i went outside to use the phone box across the street  but it wasn't working   by the time i'd done that  my ten minutes was up   none of your co workers had phones  the break was over    you clean an office block  how many telephones    i'd be fired if i used any of them   so your job is more important to you than the welfare of your child   my lady  mr ridley   a little compassion goes a long way   miss farrah  isn't it true you could have made a phone call  if you'd really wanted to   i don't know   maybe   yes   so  who is actually responsible for the death of little sean   this is why the rest of ridley's chambers call him  limbo    there's nothing he won't stoop to   he may be making your case for you  the jury will have sympathy for the mother after that   are you ready for this  there's been a note from the jury   one of the jurors speaks fluent french   he's questioning daniel matoukou's testimony   a mistranslation  i don't know how serious   tell me ridley's not applying to discharge the jury   looks like he'll succeed  mike turner would go free on a technicality   i just told them what i heard   i lived in france for 20 years   he said   ordered   not  pulled    and i have a note from other jurors  stating that you corrected three other words  that you considered mistranslations   i just told them what mr matoukou really said   i wasn't trying to be difficult  so more than one word   my lady  how can we now be certain  that the rest of the translated evidence  has been correctly understood by the jury   yes  thank you  mr ridley   i agree   it's a mess   it's more than a mess  the trial is aborted   i don't care how many trials it takes   dionne farrah and her baby will get justice   your client can't wriggle out of this indefinitely   you don't need golf  you need therapy   brutal  unforgiving therapy   how do you sleep at night  robert   in a gorgeous hand made bed  imported from osaka   but then  of course  i don't have to make do on a cps salary   we've got to retry mike turner   you're letting your heart rule your head  a retrial means going back to square one   you'd have to get turner's criminal record admitted again   i managed it last time  yeah  you got lucky   no guarantee that a new judge will be quite so obliging   and without turner's previous  your case looks perilously thin   so he walks free   i don't like it any more than you do   we have to make do with what we have at our disposal   i might be able to help you there   looking through turner's file   on his last assault charge  he was offered to deal down to a year in prison   if he gave up maureen walters   he didn't bite   he went to prison rather than give evidence against his boss   that's some loyalty  because she's not his boss   mike turner is a silent partner in the whole company   all of those buildings  they own them together   their property portfolio must be worth nearly   5 million   while a child dies in squalor in one of their flats   so maureen walters must have known exactly what mike turner was doing   they must have hatched the plan together to get the tenants out   she's culpable  mm   we go after maureen walters   as head of the company  the buck stops with her  we put her in the dock   hold on  if they're partners  then they will deny everything in unison   we have to be more pragmatic  but surely    no trial  but we get turner and walters to plead guilty to a lesser charge   george  a baby was killed   dionne farrah's life has been destroyed   this way  we convict those responsible   the most they'd get would be a couple of months   they could even walk out of court with fines   for a child's death  that's a disgrace   george is right   a trial is no guarantee of success   i'd rather see them convicted of something  than walk free   let's bring turner and walters in  see if they'll take it   'you're asking me to plead guilty '   withdrawing services with intent to cause occupier to leave    scraping the barrel a bit  james   if you don't accept my proposal  i will take mr turner back to trial  and i'll dig up every charge possible to level at mrs walters   that baby's death had nothing to do with me   i'm just trying to earn a living  keep my head above water   but that's not possible  these days  is it   nobody takes responsibility for their own lives   sorry  would it kill that girl to check the co alarm herself  eh   batteries  that's all it would have taken   but  no  she'd rather complain than do something   the law states it's your responsibility to ensure your    don't get me started about the law   do you know the amount of red tape i have to deal with every day   it's a wonder there's any small businesses left   every day  there's some new legislation making it impossible to earn an honest living   wow  a fascinating interpretation of  honest    i did nothing to hurt that baby   we're leaving   you don't even care  do you   what  i beg your pardon  i'll have you for slander   come on  mike  is there something funny   i've done prison  a few months inside  it's easy   it won't get that far  matoukou's memory won't be so clear next time   daniel matoukou's evidence is on the record   are you admitting threatening a witness  no  she didn't say a word   none of this ever happened  we were never here   she's threatening to sue you   for slander   after she blamed dionne farrah for the death of her baby   she's a one off  that woman   she knows you haven't got enough on her   that digging you wanted  tell me you found treasure   mike turner previously served for the assault charges   during that time  environmental health officers received and upheld  against maureen walters   so   the moment mike turner is released  the complaints drop   turner gets out and starts bullying tenants again   there's something else   nine months ago  the environmental health inspector changed   the new inspector is pretty generous   of the 27 complaints that were made against maureen walters since then   every single one has been resolved in her favour   that's an impressive success rate   i love the smell of bribery in the evening   see what you can prove   oh  and alesha     brilliant work  thank you   i've got five minutes   nine months ago  you were covering maureen walters' buildings   what changed  a new manager came in   reorganised the way we divided up casework   so who took over complaints against maureen walters   charlie dias  does he take bribes   i didn't hear that   did maureen walters ever offer you a bribe   she hinted at it  i'm not saying that i wasn't tempted   you know how much they pay us   the wife was going on about a new fridge   one nod to maureen walters and everyone would have been happy   has charlie dias bought a new fridge recently   your five minutes are up   charlie dias  works at environmental health   withdraws 200 quid a week from his current account  going back years   the past nine months  nothing  not a penny   doesn't prove he took bribes   his wife paid for her weekly shop by debit card for the last three years   the past nine months  cash only   so they've got extra cash  still no link to maureen walters   doesn't prove anything   what if someone offers dias a bribe   he takes the bribe   we get enough evidence like that   a jury will see that maureen walters was responsible for sean's death   set it up   look  i'm just asking  why me   we  er  took a vote   we decided you were the one who looked most like a dodgy landlord   you're supposed to be my mate   maybe take your tie off   perfect   antony simpson  yeah   charles dias  environmental health   right  we've got  er   three complaints  two about the central heating  one about the damp   yeah  i think those are    a misunderstanding   i'm having the place totally renovated   well  i'm gonna have to take a look  but i must warn you    do we have to do this now   what else would we do   careful  wait till he asks   he knows what he's doing   we're not just pretty faces  you know   i don't want to add to your paperwork  how can we make this go away   you tell me  mr simpson   well  if i knew what you were looking for    what are you looking for   i don't want to insult you  mr dias     500   here we go  'what about     250 '  is this the way in  what about   300    300  then   cash  now   cash  absolutely  yeah  good   that's one hundred  very much obliged   two hundred     charles dias  you are under arrest for corruption   oh  no  no  no  you can't do this   can i have my tie back now   entrapment  you stitched him up   he solicited the bribe   mr dias is going to resign  without a pension   then he's going to give us the names of every landlord who ever bribed him   or he'll find himself in the dock   who do you want first   in my experience  mr turner  people change their plea for two reasons   conscience or self preservation   now  as conscience seems beyond you   i'm giving you one last chance to save yourself   we've charged maureen walters with 16 counts of bribing a public official   mrs walters claims it was your idea   what     has she been saying  the lying cow   mr turner  silence is your friend   we're going to charge you both with manslaughter by gross negligence  over sean farrah's death   prison may be easy for you  mr turner  but 15 years   that's a whole slab of your life   i've been through one trial  why keep coming back at me   for all the years dionne farrah will never spend with her son   what did you have in mind  james   maureen walters has already begun to turn on you   here's where your self preservation can kick in   give evidence against her  in exchange for a lesser charge  or be back in the dock alongside her   the old divide and conquer  eh   a baby died   a baby named sean farrah  he was nine months old   maureen walters didn't strangle sean   she didn't stab him or run him over   maureen walters never even met sean farrah   she did  however  fail to maintain gas central heating systems   in a deliberate attempt to force her tenants to leave   she bribed environmental health officers to look the other way  and  in doing so  she breached her duty of care to sean   a breach amounting to gross negligence   why did she commit this breach   because she wanted more money   she wilfully and repeatedly  placed the value of her property above the value of a human life   no parent should outlive their child  and convicting maureen walters won't bring sean farrah back to his mother   but it will send a forceful warning to others   we all have a duty of care towards one another   and no breach shall go unpunished   in relation to the count of manslaughter by gross negligence   do you find the defendant  maureen walters  guilty or not guilty   guilty   well done  james  a good result   go home   have a drink  it's over   for us  maybe   transcript chocolate sync innuit
