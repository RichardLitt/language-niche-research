see  not tightened the same way as all the others   she is ours  yep  looks like it   i'm going to take this one  charlie  whether you like it or not   that's bullshit  jimmy  the boss has already allocated the next murder to my team   hey  want a bacon sandwich  no  thank you   no way can you link this to your investigation  dc travis  sir   have you got your own transport  yes  sir   i'll see you back at the incident room  mike   hudson's not going to let this one go without a fight   so as soon as they get her in the mortuary  we get over there   charles assigned it to us  are you driving  or am i   no  it's your turn   yes  i understand your problem   we have extra officers patrolling the area  excuse me  sergeant   er  could you tell me where dci langton's incident room is  please   excuse me one moment  sir  yes  through the door  second floor   thank you  we just don't have enough officers to do that   i will pass your concerns on   but the victim  we think  is melissa stephens  aged 18   reported missing a few weeks ago   last known sighting of her was by her boyfriend  as they said their goodbyes outside a restaurant in spitalfields   the parents called it in when she failed to turn up at home   clean living student at london university   no criminal record  no trouble at home   certainly not a prostitute   park yourself over on that empty desk  thanks   she may not be connected  but we desperately need a fresh case   well  hudson's already screaming about you being there  guv   he's taken the girl to the mortuary  yeah  well  he's not having her   mike   hey   can i take your name and address  and your phone number   ever been to a postmortem  travis  er    yes  sir  i have  sorry about this morning  sir   you'll be even sorrier if you throw up at the mortuary   i've been going through all the cold cases   first one was a tart called mary murphy   when that flatlined  we just kept sifting through the case files  and found one bloody victim after another  all with the same mo   but no leads  we've been on this for eight months now   isn't that right  mike  that's right   and the uh   the top brass are just about to pull the finances from us   you want a mint  no  thank you   the knot is very secure  as is the one on the tights round her neck   hold on  veronica  hold on   i need the knot intact   can you just slice away from    jimmy  i have done this before   can i get a close up picture of this   we're gonna get a lot of gases released from this one   i'd say   dead at least a month  there's a lot of infestation   there you are  right  get this over to forensics   i want it compared to the other girls   to confirm the knots are tied in the same way  can you turn the body over  yes   i'm going to cut the tights loose next   on first impression  it looks like she was garrotted   tied from the front  so he was looking at her  while he was doing this   there's some trauma to the left side of the face   he may have knocked her out   there's some facial animal predation       and her tongue appears to be partially eaten   let's get the clothes off her   jimmy  we need to talk   like  now   this is bang out of order  wanna bet  she's mine   these'll prove it  you    dci hudson   you get out of my mortuary and put a bloody gown on   are you all right at the back there  travis  it was the smell  sir   well  next time  take the mint when it's offered to you   either that  or use a nose plug   bras removed and used to tie the hands   as you can see  most of the victims had previous convictions for prostitution   all been dumped in different areas of london dating back to 1996   all murdered in exactly the same way  that's why they're on the board   can i take the files home with me   i've got a lot of catching up to do  as long as you don't tell me about it   travis  get me melissa's misper file from borough   i need everything they've got   especially any cctv footage   we don't even know if it is melissa's   parents just confirmed her clothing   we've got id from her dental records   like a little angel  wasn't she   get me a coffee  travis   woman  he needs the comparison results as soon as possible  ok   great  thanks for your help  bye   could you just take that from me  sir   had to go all the way to colombia for it  did we   thank you   shut the door   i worked with your father a few years back  he was a bloody good cop   that's why you're here  travis  thank you  sir   i'm sorry to hear he passed on   i hope you don't mind me asking  erm     do you think there should be a press release to warn all the other girls   warn them all you like  it won't stop them if they need a fix   right  were they all from london  none of them were from london   they were what we call  weekenders   they come up to london to do the business  and then go back to manchester or sheffield or leeds   wherever   and there's no evidence that they knew each other   you need to read up on the inquiry details and the thousands of statements   well  go on  get cracking   we're doing a lot of work on a case we don't officially have yet   that prick hudson gets his way   we're going to have to hand it all over to him   this cctv is not in any kind of order  this one comes after no 2   that's so typical of bloody borough  yes  can't detectives count   not in borough  they can't   look  mike     i know i only saw the body briefly at the scene     put that out   as far as i'm concerned  we should have the first call on this   this murder is linked to my investigation  i'm sure of it   well  i've got a scientist looking at the knots as we speak   i'm expecting a call from her any minute to confirm it   paul  have you viewed all the melissa stephens cctv   i looked at everything they sent  but there may be more we haven't got yet   i don't think i've missed anything  but i've had to do it all on my own  how many cameras picked her up   five  the restaurant  artillery row  the tube  hoxton square     and coronet street   i'll double check i haven't missed anything if we get the job  we'll get it  is that melissa   that's our girl  stop it there   take it back to the footage outside the restaurant   they're on different dvds  they're split between different locations   so usually i have to find     commander leigh  dci hudson   barbara  yes  sir   do us a favour   get me a chicken and cheese sandwich from the canteen  ok   no tomatoes   my team was in the frame for the next assignment     should i put all these on one dvd  maybe wait   never mind edging me out of the fucking mortuary   melissa stephens is my case   plus someone told the borough that they had authority  to seize all the cctv and missing persons files  all right  all right   i admit that i'm not going to give her to you  so that you and your flat footed team   sit down  sit down   now  i'm not the least bit interested    dci langton  if you bring me unequivocal evidence     it's like i'm his personal shopper   and i'm fed up with collecting his dry cleaning every week   and the commander  god bless her  is going to give us some extra man power and resources   your sandwich  sir  thanks  no tomatoes   no  sir  but if there's a trace of one  i'll pick it out personally   how did hudson take it   he's ecstatic   right  let's get started   you get in touch with our office   i need these as quickly as possible tomorrow  now  let's go through    boss   what is it  paul  got them all on one disk   i'm no spielberg  but i put it together   i'll let the commander know that you're stalling

your teeth capped   sure  no  erm  recently   i'm due to start shooting a film in the states  and  well  you know what the americans think        about british teeth   and you'd be able to give us the name and address of your dentist   sure  absolutely  and permission to look over your dental records   this is getting rather silly now   my client has agreed to come and answer your questions   you have not arrested him  no   i suggest we call it a day unless there's something else   no  no  no  ed  really  it's fine   if dci langton feels he had good reason for bringing me in   then i'm happy

with you       i'd really appreciate it if all this could be kept out of the press   there is no reason why it shouldn't be  any bad publicity  especially like this   could ruin my career   just at a time when it's taking off in the states   i'm sure you both understand  i'm sorry  i really do have to go   dci langton   thank you for coming in  mr daniels  no  absolute pleasure   very nice to meet

he's taken it all away   x rays  tooth moulds   the lot  it's his right to do so  apparently   and they don't keep copies  nope   we can't make a match to melissa if we don't have his dental records   yeah  but we know some of the victims lived at his mother's address   circumstantial evidence  it's a hell of a coincidence  sir   tomorrow we go back to his flat  we turn it over  excuse me   what i suggest we do is have lunch     all the victims' close relatives have been re interviewed   we've got nada  none of them knew duffy  right  right   avoid the cromwell road  for christ's sake   and we're not gonna get anything from the house in shalcott street  it was demolished four years ago   joan  get the film unit to double check daniels was in cornwall for our time frame   and tell barbara to contact the fbi  he did some work over there   there's a copy of his cv in my desk   get it to check work permits  visa details   see if there are any victims with that mo during the time he was there   fbi  pushing the bloody envelope on this one   oh  yes   search warrant  mr daniels   now  what exactly is it that you're looking for  maybe i could help you save some time   we need to see your dental records  your dentist said you took them with you   i   don't have them  i'm sorry  i threw them away   i'm afraid we can't take your word for that  mr daniels  fair enough   check out the cupboards in the hallway   evans  cover the bedroom  hollen  downstairs   stately fucking home  isn't it   makes a change from the usual shithole  eh   detective constable travis  anna  was it  lovely name   you have absolutely beautiful legs  dancer's legs  actually   thanks for the compliment   but i was the sort of child with two left feet  actually   loved the ballet  though   my dad used to listen to this  really  what does he do   he was in the met   was   yeah  he's dead   oh  i'm so sorry   i never knew my father   have you ever tried to trace him   no  he'd only be after me for my money   sorry  what on earth do you hope to find in architectural review   are you married   have you ever been married  oh  i've been close   i'm not the easiest person to live with  i'm obsessively neat   but then  i suppose  you've noticed that   it's probably to do with the fact that  when i was a child   i never had anything that belonged to me  my clothes were always second hand   whenever i got fostered  i'd always get the other kids' hand me downs  with vomit and piss and    ugh  it was horrible   anything  nothing on the dental records   take a look at this  what about it  that's not julia roberts  is it   well  it could be  take a look at the car   could be theirs  when we checked with the dvla   he didn't have a pale blue merc registered  right   this is his file on car insurance   not listed under his name  but a company he owns   mercedes  pale blue  circa 1983   it's the same type of car melissa stephens was seen getting into   i've been racking my brains  thinking if there was anything or anyone from my past  that might help your investigation   but it was so long ago  i     the only thing i can vaguely remember  is some guy who drove a large car   what was his name  erm    peter   no  er  john    john  i think   such a long time ago  i can't remember  i was just a kid   anna  there's something i wanna show you   i've never shown this to anyone before   it's the only picture i've got of me as a child   frightened little boy  successful actor   face to face   mr daniels  do you own a 1980s pale blue mercedes   no  no  not any more  i did   it was one of my favourite cars   you sold it  ah  worse   i was    i was going to  and then i had a prang in it  so that was that   i sent it to the crushers  did you get a receipt   yeah  yeah  yeah  i did  it's here somewhere   er  it would take me a little while to find it   um    better still   why don't you just check with the company   ashton's in hackney  we will  thank you   anna  it's been a real pleasure meeting you     the boss is not a happy man   fbi have got back to us  a woman's body was found in chicago  coinciding with the period that daniels was filming there   when was that  february 2000   strangled with her own tights  hands tied with her bra   identified as thelma delray  prostitute  aged 22   bye bye  was he in cornwall when melissa was killed   alan daniels was booked for filming that entire week  but they were behind schedule  so    he could have sneaked back up to london  it's possible   well  get back to them and confirm  when daniels was in chicago   he did some chat show  we're getting a copy sent over   good  get onto michael parkes  the profiler  i want him to see it   unless maybe travis you'd like to take the disk home with you   yeah  yeah  ok   what  ah  it's just that when we were leaving   you and mr daniels seemed to be on very intimate terms   barbara    yeah   this photograph  yeah  i got the picture from teresa booth's mother   that's teresa  have a look at beryl villiers   who's that   guv  we've maybe got another link to the women knowing each other   villiers and booth  travis  on your bike   i want you to interview beryl villiers' mother   i don't know  you get all the perks  first spain  now nottingham     all i get is his bloody laundry       dc travis  thanks for seeing me at such short notice   that's all right  i'll just close up   when she was 17  she was gorgeous   i've looked out some more for you  actually   they only found out who she was  by tracing the number on her breast implants   and the worst part of it was       what they wrote about her in the papers    prostitute   well  she was never arrested or charged with being one   she and i had some difficulties   beryl was always very headstrong   she left school and went to work in a local health club   did she ever mention somebody called anthony duffy    i hardly saw her after   not for want of trying  but    she got caught up with a bad crowd   especially this man at her gym   horrible man  john mcdowell   there he is   he was to blame  she took off with him  and broke my heart  there was nothing i could do   out  out  out   but it was him that got her on the drugs   driving around in his big  flash car  like the sun shone out of him   the last time i saw beryl was seven years ago   i hardly recognised her     i had to bathe her like a child       and she had these marks   was she still with this mcdowell   he used her and dumped her   she said she was going to london   i never told anyone this   i was too ashamed   after she'd gone   taking jewellery  any money around    under the bed   i found a syringe   how could she do that to me   but i still tried to find her  i     there was an address left on a pad by my phone   a london address  no  manchester   shalcott street   i went all the way there and this awful woman answered   i said i wanted to speak to beryl   but she said she'd left and shut the door on my face   mrs kenworth  i'd like to show you some photographs   tell me if you recognise any of them   she was a nasty piece of work   women chat and laugh  he's lying there in the middle  with all this bloody hair   paramedic come rushing in   she was just lying there   fuck off   so mrs kenworth confirmed that barbara whittle lived at shalcott street   so did her daughter  beryl villiers   beryl's boyfriend also spent time there  his name's john mcdowell   hang on  paul  run me a check on john mcdowell in manchester   this john mcdowell  has he been questioned  not according to her   but i think it could be the same guy daniels couldn't remember the name of  daniels couldn't remember what   the name of this guy   said he drove some flash car   i think it could be the same guy  sir  john mcdowell   for christ's sake  travis  why didn't you bloody tell me that before  i forgot  sir   i'm sorry  it's just  with all the travelling and everything     hello   horrible man   john mcdowell   he was to blame   johnny    ta raa     it was him that got her on the drugs   you and me   out  i'm not going anywhere   come out   get in  get in  fuck off   get in  no   guv  this is john mcdowell  real charmer   quite a bit of previous   'two counts of gbh  both on women  drug dealing   well known both amongst the vice squad and drug unit '  no known current address  get manchester to get him in   we're letting daniels off the hook   you think it could be the two of them   could be   phone rings  travis   hello  anna   who's this   don't you recognise my voice   er  no  i don't    it's alan   mr daniels    alan    please    you don't mind me calling   no  no  i've actually just walked in the door   can you just hang on a second   sorry about that   there's a charity performance of carmen at sadler's wells tomorrow night   would you like to come  the ballet  well  i don't know what my work schedule is tomorrow    well  when you know what it is  give us a call   these tickets are like gold dust  good night  anna    mr parkes  dci langton is ready for you   follow me  sure  thank you   profiler michael parkes is here  we've also got the interview with daniels on american tv set up   give us a minute  paul   how did he get your number  well  i didn't give it to him   i'm in the phone book  when's it for   tonight  some charity do  apparently  i thought  if i went   maybe i could get something out of him   if i was wired  or maybe a hidden camera    don't talk crap  travis    wired  hidden cameras     you watch too much tv   well  i've got to let him know  i'll think about it    rosa  it's great to see you     you look fantastic    oh  thank you     it's great to be here  but i'm pretty sure half your audience haven't got a clue who i am     well  i'm sure all of chicago is going to know who you are  after blue diamond      well  i've got to say      joan  i've got mrs thornton on the phone for you  thank you   hello  mrs thornton  thank you for getting back to me   yes  i'm trying to get hold of your husband  roger thornton   oh  oh  i'm sorry   no  i didn't realise you'd recently separated    i always remember wanting to travel    this is a murder inquiry  mrs thornton    great travellers and     no  he's not a suspect    as an actor  the fact that i can go all over the world  and get paid to do what i love is pretty fantastic     you are certainly a lucky man    i certainly am     let me ask you something  how do you feel about watching yourself on film     you know  i've got a lot of actor friends who claim  they don't like watching themselves   but honestly  i haven't got a problem with it     if i looked like you  i wouldn't have a problem with it  either     no  seriously  i watch to learn  i really do    if you could get back to me within the next hour  that would be great   thank you  mrs thornton  thank you for your time  goodbye    let's just sit back and enjoy   oh    we seem to have some technical problem   oh    you must have some enemies out there   oh  we don't need film  we've got the real thing right here   tell me  you play a master     jewel thief  yes   yes  that's right  but not a very good one   on my first day of filming  i picked up the blue diamond    which had taken months to make  i may add    and i properly dropped it     and it smashed on the floor into thousands of pieces  and believe you me  i was not very popular     oh  i am not surprised   but you're lucky you weren't proposing to anyone with that ring   but let me ask you  have you ever proposed to anyone     well  i've   been close   but at the moment  actually   i'm still searching for that perfect woman   when i find her  i promise you'll be the first to know   but seriously  who'd want to marry an english actor     well  let's put that to our studio audience   who'd want to marry an english actor  alan daniels   anybody want him    well  i think they love you out there and i wholeheartedly agree   i think that you're fabulous  i think this film is very exciting   it's wonderful    i'm just very grateful somebody wants to employ me     i'm grateful that you found time to visit with us on afternoon chicago   ladies and gentlemen  i give you alan daniels     thank you very much     oh   play it again  carl   could he be our man  i couldn't honestly tell you   i need to know how much risk i'll be exposing travis to  if i let her do this   well  if alan daniels is your man   in his arrogance  he may have earmarked anna as his next victim   well  keep that particular theory to yourself   do you think she can get anything from him   she might  his ego is such  that he'll believe he's above suspicion  and he might just let something slip   so  anna  apparently he showed you a photograph in his wallet   yes   he drew you in close to him  by saying he'd never shown it to anyone before   yes  so he was able to create an instant bond with you  tried to   what you have to do is to use that   try to draw him out  you just might get him to miscalculate   are you still up for it   call him  what  now   no  tomorrow  travis  when the ballet's over   there's his number   you might need to get your hair done   got a frock  frock   yes  you know   something dressy   yeah  don't worry  i'll make an effort    yes  who is this   it's anna   anna travis   hello  anna    duffy  daniels    she locked me in a cupboard under the stairs   that doesn't make me a killer   well  do you think he is innocent  i think he might be  sir   this guy  john mcdowell  they found     one of the victims' handbags in his flat   are you trying to tell me that kathleen keegan's dead  as well   i haven't seen this slag for ten years   mr daniels is helping the police  in connection with the murder of melissa stephens   it's time you either charged my client or released him   this is all nonsense  all nonsense   transcript  english yyets net speed resync  bean
