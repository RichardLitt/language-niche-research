   1   must be good to be home again  sir   yeah   well  we'll see about that        good afternoon   i'm here to see assistant director harold cooper   do you have an appointment   i do not   tell him it's raymond reddington       ressler  washington field office   i'm the case agent on reddington     when did this happen    under an hour ago   we confirm it's actually him   it's him all right  prints match  tattoos   he even volunteered classified details about a brussels mission in '08     what happened in brussels    sir   we tried to kill him  sir   it really is him   came in with a briefcase containing every alias he's ever used   most of 'em we've never even heard of   what does he want   don't know  won't talk   he's a stone   call lab services   have them fit him with an alphachip rfid tag   assemble a full intel review  nsa  cia   what exactly do you want to know   everything   ressler  raymond  red  reddington attended the naval academy   top of his class  graduated by the time he was 24   he was bring groomed for admiral   then in 1990  reddington's coming home  to see his wife and his daughter for christmas   he never arrives   this highly respected officer  up and disappears from the face of the earth     until four years later  when classified noforn documents start showing up in maghreb   islamabad  beijing   these leaks were traced to reddington   this guy's an equal opportunity offender   a facilitator of sorts   who's built an enterprise brokering deals for fellow criminals     ouch    he has no country   he has no political agenda   reddington's only allegiance is to the highest bidder   they call him something in the papers      the concierge of crime     he's online   evidently someone with the authority to make decisions has arrived   i think i smell the stench of your cologne  agent cooper  smells like hubris   get these feeds fixed  i want him up here  come on   you must have many questions   so let's begin with the most important one    why i'm here   remember the 1986 attack on the u s  embassy in damascus   the abduction of the six foreign nationals  from the french consulate in algiers in '97   or the 2002 breach of the krungthai bank in bangkok   you see these events as unrelated   i can tell you one man is responsible for all three   his name is ranko zamani   you want him  i want him   so let's say for the moment our interests are aligned   ranko sinisa zamani   serbian national educated in the u s   cooper  ranko zamani's been dead for six years     he's a non existent threat    then a dead man  just stepped off united 283 from munich to dulles   he entered the country under the name sacha m  chacko     cleared customs at 10 56 a m    listen up  people   the lab just pulled a latent print from the airline arm rest   nine points of comparison   zamani's alive   you have my attention   were you wrong   i was wrong   yes  you were wrong   at least it's not the first time  familiar territory   now  i'll give you zamani  but first     no  but firsts   you don't decide anything   agent cooper  you've overestimated your authority   i said i'll help you find zamani  and i will   but from this point forward  there's one very important rule     i speak only with elizabeth keen   who the hell's elizabeth keen   oh  buddy   seriously  dude   babe  what time is it   i don't know  what time you gotta be there     oh  crap    what's up     crap    what   no  my first day   babe  are you good  you need help   i missed the bus  babe   i'm gonna need to take the car   you can't take the car  i need the car   i've got field trip planning committee   you took the dog out  right   i did  for the field trip    air and space or the d c  zoo     the zoo's gender neutral    all right     good thinkin'    we're out of milk     oop  sorry    is this pee   i'm standing in pee  babe     he's your dog  too    yeah  thanks a lot   i'm gonna smell like a urinary tract infection on my first day   hey  don't forget we got the last adoption meeting today  one thirty   you heard me  right  one thirty   yep  one thirty  last meeting   i'm in the car  you got the keys   yeah  in my pocket  i got your coffee   no more peeing  dude   what   we both woke up seven minutes ago   i'm pretty sure my pants are on backwards  and i can barely see straight   but you are somehow dressed   composed  and as beautiful as the day i met you     i think i'm forgetting something    yeah   you know i'm not gonna let this job come between us and our family  right   i know   we want a family  we're going to have a family   were you serious about that kid thing  because i got stuff goin     ow   mama   today's the day   yeah  i know   man  i am so proud of you     thanks    you worked so hard for this   are you nervous   no  but i am very late     agent keen   donald ressler  washington field office   i need you to come with me right away   babe  i don't think i'm gonna need to take the car     agent keen  am i getting that right     yes  sir    harold cooper   assistant director of counterterrorism   yes  sir  i know who you are  sir   so  uh   can you tell us what's going on   i wish i could   i can tell you that     i've been vetted by the agency like everyone else   you know  same background checks  psych profiles   i'm sure opr's trolling my digital footprint right now   and i can tell you what they'll find   what will they find   nothing  i have no history with reddington   they tell me today's your first day as a profiler   yes  sir   i was reassigned from new york  i graduated quantico last month     congratulations    thank you   do me a favor  profile yourself   i'm sorry  sir   who are you  what is he looking for   profile elizabeth keen   oh  okay   uh     um  well  i've been with the bureau for four years   i was the head of the mobile emergency psych unit in new york   we worked murders     extortion      read your r  sum     of course   my colleagues call me  sir    they think i'm     a bitch   like most kids who raised themselves   i can display narcissistic behavior   i can be withdrawn  disconnected  uh     i have a deep yearning to understand and relate to the criminal mind   i'm board certified in forensic psychology   and yet i operate under the delusion  that i can rewrite my past by having kids of my own   do you find it odd reddington surrendered himself  the day you started working as a profiler   i think that it suggests he was waiting for me   why you  specifically   because i'm new and he thinks i can be easily manipulated   the man obviously doesn't know me very well   liz  what is this place   d c  metro sorting facility  u s  postal service   it was abandoned and slated for demo twelve years ago   the bureau acquired the building post 9 11   been operating a variety of covert operations here ever since   so this is a black site   we're sentimental  we prefer to call it the post office     if you need anything  remember     we're right here             agent keen  what a pleasure   well     i'm here   you got rid of your highlights     you look much less baltimore   do you get back home much   tell me about zamani   i haven't been home in years   why involve me  i'm nobody  it's my first day   nothin' special about me   oh  i think you're very special   within the hour  ranko zamani will abduct  the daughter of u s  general daniel ryker   there'll be some kind of diversion   communications will be scrambled   then he'll grab the girl   he wants to be out of the country within 36 hours   if you don't move quickly  she will die   that's what i know   and how do you know this   because i'm the one who got him into the country   and i'm supposed to believe you    no  of course not   i'm a criminal  criminals are notorious liars   everything about me is a lie   but if anyone can give me a second chance  it's you   the two of us have    overcome so much   i mean  look at you   abandoned by a father who was a career criminal   a mother who died of    weakness and shame   and yet here you are  about to make a name for yourself   about to    capture ranko zamani   i'm gonna make you famous  lizzy   what did you tell him   what are you talking about   how did he know those things  private things about my family   why didn't your father's criminal record show up on your background

people  i told you zamani would take the girl   i told you that's all i knew   this is in your hands now   i need your help with zamani   how about a trade   you tell me and i'll tell you   tell me about the scar on your palm   i've noticed how you stroke it   there was a fire  i was fourteen   someone tried to hurt you   not exactly  no     may i see it   is a child really what you want   how on earth     but a baby won't fix what happened in the past   you lost the right to speak about parenthood  when you abandoned your wife and daughter on christmas eve     the girl    you won't find the girl  until you learn to look at this differently   and how should i look at this   like a criminal   may come easier than you think   shall i show you   well  at least you know what zamani looks like    oh  my goodness   i haven't seen him in years   very interesting fellow   completely unrelated to this   you're pointing at the wrong guy here   miroslav   they call him the chemist   a highly regarded munitions expert   he left mit to work for the russian  vor usoyan   last two years    very expensive freelancer   i don't know what the hell any of this is   ooh  the german   a banker  name's reinhardt   he's most likely moving the money   what about the girl   what do you have on the girl and her father   your 36 hour timeline would suggest a singular event   something in d c   i'm not sure how the girl fits   what about the chemist   important   well paid     whatever zamani's planning is expensive   some sort of attack   you're thinking like a cop   cops are so objective   they're obligated to protocols  make it personal   ressler  okay  this is nonsense   zamani's sick  cia says he carries nipah virus   dying makes him dangerous   so what does he desperately want before he dies   and how does that relate to the little girl   her father  the general  spent time in bosnia     supporting nato troops in the bihac pocket region   zamani's home   he bombed a chemical weapons facility     poisoning the village   it's about his family   they died  zamani survived   he wants revenge   he hired the chemist to build a bomb  detonate it in washington   he's gonna use beth to settle the score     deliver the bomb   cooper  okay  let's move  we're on a clock   i have an acquaintance   they call him the innkeeper  runs a series of safe houses   lean on him  he'll know where to find the chemist   you find the chemist  you'll find zamani   where is this innkeeper   if i tell you  you have to give me something in return   no more restraints  no more cages   if you want to capture zamani   he has to believe i'm moving freely     in touch with old friends   staying in one of my favorite hotels     if you think we're gonna put you up at the sheraton      save your starwood points  harold   the sheraton's not my scene   hey  live it up  pal   soon as this is over  you're headed back to a black site   mr  homan  it's awfully nice to have you back   there's complimentary champagne   as usual  the bed's made up with blankets instead of a comforter     will there be anything else    no  thank you  eric   tip the gentleman  will you   where is the chemist   fbi  hands   tranquilo  papi         how lucky can one guy be           i kissed her and she kissed me          like the fella once said          ain't that a kick in the head       they found the lab   they're interrogating the chemist as we speak     what about the bomb    we think that we got there  before he built it   i gotta get out of here and clear my head   take a shower  see my husband   don't go too far   oh  my       did they say yes   oh  baby  how did you do this   oh  my god  i cannot believe     we're gonna have a baby  and this is exac     tom     sit down   sit down     do what i say or i'll shoot your husband   see  tom and i  we have been talking   trying to figure out how you knew i was in town   i tell him you figure out my plan     to take the general's daughter   tom  look at me   make for nice surprise   but my people handle quite well  i think   it's gonna be okay   but then  your people come for my chemist friend   i was finished with the chemist   so you saved me payment for services   and for that  i thank you   but   it did make me wonder what else you know   what else do you know   i don't     tom   no  no  no  no  no  over here   i ask question   what else do you know about my plan   a bomb  maybe  we don't know   we only knew about the girl  the rest is just speculation   tom  baby  it's gonna be okay     uhh    you son of a bitch   what else do you know about my plan    nothing  i swear   oh    my god   you're not as smart as reddington says   my friend  he is always so obsessed with you   i'm not sure why   it's gonna be okay   now  what i have planned will make for many casualties   so now you have choice   stop me now and save many americans   or save only     one    what do you choose     tom  baby   oh  my god  baby  keep your eyes open   i'm gonna get help   i'm gonna get help    don't fall aslee     you're gonna be okay     you're gonna be okay    911  what is your emergency     did you send him   are you the one who did this   did what   he was in my house   my husband is on a ventilator because zamani came     calm down and tell me what happened   don't play stupid  you're the only thing connecting us   he told me that you're obsessed with me   did he mention the girl or the bomb   we're not a team     zamani    i'm not your partner   what did he say   i don't know  he said     he said something about casualties     and chemical agents  and     he talked about you   he even thanked me for getting rid of the chemist   so the bomb's still in play   why the hell was he in my house    tell me  you know him   why is my husband dying in a hospital right now    the truth is  despite your feelings  your husband doesn't matter   zamani did you a favor  lizzy   now  you know i just punched a hole in your carotid   best chance  one minute before you pass out   so here's how it's gonna work   you tell me how i find zamani and make this right   or i let you die right here   understand   yeah   but if i die     you'll never know the truth about your husband   you know nothing about my husband       agent ressler   i gotta talk to him   you shouldn't even be here   you're under official review  you know that   i know  the chemist isn't talking  is he   no   red knows zamani  just give me five minutes     thank you   he's gone     it's good to see you  old friend   initiating track   okay  got him   his chip indicates he's at the lincoln memorial     we're on him  forty seconds out  en route   how did things go with agent keen   paid her a visit  like you asked   and the husband   like you asked   it's a shame you're gonna miss the cherry blossoms   zamani  i think a great many people will miss the cherry blossoms   tell me  the general's daughter is such a risk   zamani  this is about much more than one girl   he's on the move  heading westbound   zamani  this is about     the children     raymond  today     on this day     i am giving their plague back to them   in sixty years they will be talking about this day     about my legacy       still heading west        hello    reddington  there's a wrinkle   zamani wants more than the general's daughter     he's after children    where are you   tech  approaching 14th   you gotta move  you gotta move   i need you to tell me what zamani said   in the house     what did he say   what did you see   he  uh  he asked about the chemist and about the girl   no  what did you see   uh  there was blood   there was blood everywhere   take a breath  lizzy   over here   there was a tattoo   he's serbian orthodox   tech  you're closing on him     he wouldn't have a tattoo    liz  i know what i saw   this mark  i've seen it before   tom  field trip  d c  air and space or the d c  zoo   it wasn't a tattoo   it was a stamp   zamani's gonna bomb the d c  zoo   ressler  i got nothin'  come on  where is he    he's turning onto maryland ave   tech  dead ahead  he's dead ahead   he's stopped   the signal has stopped  he's right there   ressler  where is he    he should be right behind you   vertically   are there stairs near you   beth   hi  honey  are you hurt   no   are you alone   he said to wait here for my daddy   he said not to take it off       reddington  whatever you do  don't touch it   there's less than three minutes   i've got to evacuate  call the bomb squad     your people will never be there in time   my friend  he's on his way   your friend  what friend     reddington   reddington   hands in the air   zamani   step down from the ledge   hands where i can see 'em or i'll shoot you down   tell the general his daughter was     an unfortunate civilian casualty   he pulled a tracking chip   son of a bitch     did reddington send you     i can't understand what you're saying  can you stop the bomb     can you stop it        are we gonna be okay    yeah  baby  we're gonna be okay   hey  i was scared when i was your age  too   but i had a secret weapon to keep me safe   my daddy gave it to me   it's very special  i've never shown it to anybody   it's like magic   what does it do   whenever i'm feeling sad or afraid   i just touch it like this  and it makes me brave   do you want to see if it can make you brave   yeah     you're a brave girl           uzasny   wait   wait   what are you doing    just consider the device his payment for services   pesibo  nos dash daisa   that is a chemical weapon   he's fascinated by the things   he certainly has more use for it than we do     daddy   red vest  gray sweatshirt  he's got the bomb   we're gonna make a great team     cooper  who is the ukrainian     i'm not gonna tell you    you gave him a chemical weapon   he took it   that's the price of doing business  harold   with certain people who can get certain things done  you know that   you never look at the larger picture   the bomb didn't detonate  the girl is safe  zamani's dead   frankly  i think this all went down rather swimmingly   this was never about zamani   you surrendered and infiltrated the fbi to get at our intelligence     your intelligence    to get that weapon   i certainly don't want your intelligence  agent ressler   i'm quite happy with my own   i think it's more likely that i tried to help you in good faith  and had to finish the job myself because     you couldn't   i think we're finished   well  this was fun  let's do it again   really  let's do it again   understand  zamani was only the first   the first what   name  on the list   what list   it's called the blacklist  that sounds exciting   that's why we're all here  of course  my wish list   a list i've been cultivating for over twenty years   politicians  mobsters  hackers     spies   we have our own list   agent ressler  please   we all know your top ten is little more than a publicity campaign   it's a popularity contest at best   i'm talking about the criminals who matter   the ones you can't find because you don't even know they exist   zamani was a small fish   i'm ahab   and if you want the whales on my list  you have to play by my rules   i never sleep in the same location for more than two nights in a row   i want a fully encrypted 8 millimeter tag embedded in my neck     not that garbage from alphachip you stuck in my shoulder   i want my own security  i've compiled a list of five acceptable applicants   pick two   whatever i tell you falls under an immunity package  that i negotiate myself   and finally  most importantly   i speak only with elizabeth keen       daylight comes          daylight goes          how far will reach          ain't
