we lived in an electric world   we relied on it for everything   and then the power went out   everything stopped working   we weren't prepared   fear and confusion led to panic   the lucky ones made it out of the cities   the government collapsed   militias took over  controlling the food supply  and stockpiling weapons   we still don't know why the power went out   but we're hopeful that someone will come  and light the way   previously on revolution     i'm gonna have to ask you to come with us   under the authority of the monroe republic     why    you can't take him     put it down    stop

you   those are the orders    bring him back alive   so you're militia   you used me to flush him out   you're a son of a bitch   so you're just gonna leave me like this   yeah   you're such a crack soldier  you can figure a way out   is your name even nate   no   i've got orders   but then why'd you save me     maggie  slow down    we can still catch up   we don't know where she went  and we can't hunt       not like she can    aaron  please   she will find miles  but we will never find her   not without a gps   so you're saying we just let her go off  to some militia prison camp   i'm not happy about this either     but we'll see her again    how do you know that  aaron   how do you know that   just    you know  we will   do you want to know the reason why i keep this   because somewhere inside are the only pictures of my kids   birthdays  first steps  their whole lives     and i don't have a single photo to hold in my hands   i spend hours staring at this stupid thing   because it's getting harder and harder  to remember their faces   so i'm sorry     but there's no way of knowing who we'll see  and who we won't see again     not anymore     hey  cap     i'm pretty messed up  huh   i'm afraid so  son   it's die quick or die painful   that's all you got left   you drink every drop   then you sort of drift off  you won't feel a thing     i'm scared   don't be   down the hatch  son   where you're going  you'll be warm and rested and fed   you'll be with your family   and the best part     you'll bask in the brightest  most beautiful light       mommy  why are we here   daddy had to get some things from our work   he'll be right back   my ball     you like basketball    yes   me  i  uh    i love the bulls   but they probably played their last game  huh   charlie  charlie  come over here     she's beautiful    charlie  come here   yeah   such a pretty face   i'd hate to have to smash it in   i'd like your food  please     all of it   damn it  charlie  you're killing me     what are you doing here    i'm coming with you   i told you i would come and find you   not good enough   you need to let me come with you   look  i get it  you want your brother   you've been abundantly clear on the subject   no  you don't get it  you need to let me help  okay     why    because it's my fault  miles   what are you talking about   i took care of danny   after my mom died  it was me   he gets these asthma attacks   so i had to watch him   i wouldn't sleep for more than an hour at a stretch   checking on him     ten times every night just to make sure  he was still breathing   i didn't let him out of my sight     until the day that they took him   because i was off pouting like some brat   and if i was there  maybe i could have stopped them   maybe my dad would still be alive   maybe danny wouldn't be off scared and alone   and if he gets sick  they're not     miles  i can't sleep   you got to let me help  i can't just sit there and wait   okay   so  uh  i have a confession to make   um     um     ben gave me this   he said to keep it safe and to bring it to a woman  named grace beaumont in grant park  illinois     who is she    i don't know   why   why her   maggie  what if we could get the power back on   what if you could go home again   what if you could see your kids again     so  we take this to this grace woman   and she does what with it   i don't know   ben just said she knew something about the power   this doesn't make any sense   but that    that's the thing  i think it actually might     how    the blackout   that doesn't make any sense     totally corn holed the laws of nature   and it shouldn't be permanent  we should be able to fix this   but for some reason  we just can't     but if it were man made      man made   why would someone do something like that   listen  if i'm right  then this is good news     this is the best news    how   because if it's man made   then maybe we can fix it   and surely goodness and mercy shall follow me  all the days of my life   and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever     amen    all  amen     go ahead   spit it out     i'm sorry  what    have some conviction   if you think something  then say it   you don't like that i killed that traitor back there   even though he owned guns and a rebel flag   even though he shot one of my boys   but i'll tell you what i think   i think the monroe militia is the one thing  between us and total anarchy   maybe it's just a finger in the dam   but it's the only order we got left   do you want to know what i think   i think that you tell yourself that   i think the truth is you like to kill     because you're a murderer and a psychopath     i appreciate the honesty     move it    lift     lift   lift   let's go  move   crazy son of a bitch must actually think  he can get the power going     who    general monroe   and if he does     imagine what he can do with one of those   got to get it over this hill before sundown   what'd those prisoners do   most of them probably just didn't pay their taxes   that's nora   hey   get up     get up right now      they're gonna kill you  get up   up  you lazy piece of crap    i'll tell you something    i might be good with a sword   but i got jack squat against a rifle like that     buddy  i'd keep your hands off if i      hi   miles   no  get out of here     these aren't even locked    'cause i picked it     now go    hey  man   she doesn't want to go  take me   shut up   come on  go  go  go  go  go   hey  wake up  wake up   thank you so much   i didn't want to be rescued  miles   and i sure as hell didn't need to be   wow  you could have fooled me     you were on a chain gang    on purpose   yeah  but    wait  what   i got arrested on purpose   give me some credit     i'm working a job    what job   the sniper rifle   i'm stealing the sniper rifle   you went through all that trouble for a rifle     who the hell is this    i'm his niece     you have family    most people do   and  yes  the rifle is more than worth it   the militia controls all the guns   so a beauty like that on the black market     priceless   i was gonna sneak up  slit the warden's throat   take the gun  but now sneaking's kind of out   well  how was i supposed to know that   you weren't  you were supposed to keep the hell away from me     remember    things are different now   like how        like how  miles   like me     he's here because of me    meaning   the militia took my brother  and he's gonna get him back   seriously  what's your angle   no angle  this is for real  nora   and i want you to come with us     you owe me    oh  for that amazing rescue   you know what for   okay   but i'm getting that gun first   you're never gonna get close to that rifle  not now   not without him shooting you with it   you want my help   we're getting that gun   not exactly a colt  45  but it'll do the trick   you're gonna shoot the warden   with that   yeah  miles  that's the idea   that thing only works from a foot away   how are we gonna get close enough     we'll sneak up    in broad daylight   they know what you look like  and they'll kill me on sight   so i'll do it   some innocent girl lost in the woods     i can get close    i like her   i like her a lot   forget it   it's a good idea  miles  she just takes out the warden   and you and i sweep up the rest   you can't do it   i appreciate the concern  but i     no  no  i mean you actually cannot do it     you will choke    i won't   you  who bitched about me killing somebody in cold blood   you're just gonna walk up  shoot somebody in the face    for a sniper rifle    it's not about the rifle     and it's not about you or her    really  what's it about   the 30 innocent people down there who are working as slaves   and it's insane to me that neither of you  have even mentioned it   what the hell's wrong with you   so what do i have to do   here we go   lift  lift  lift   you     put it down right now   i'm sorry  i was just hunting     what the hell are you doing    i was hunting   i got lost   hey  take it easy   bring her over here   i'll snap her neck  stay back   it's okay  baby  it's okay   let her go   okay  you sure you want to do that   what if you hit your little girl   come here  baby   i'm just hungry   hey  stop  we need that food   i can't let you take it  i'll shoot   i don't think you will     i said stop   so you're lost  huh   i know the area pretty good  where you from       gun     hey     hey     okay  i got to hand it to you   you did good    did good    yeah   all these people are free   i killed two men today   maybe that's not a big deal for you   maybe it's another monday or whatever  but it is to me   we shouldn't have to do this   things should be     i don't know     you are     very unusual   what's that supposed to mean   it's not an insult  charlie       oh  son of a bitch   what   when did you get that   just relax   you're not selling that sniper rifle  are you   you're gonna give it away to the resistance   everyone changes  miles   you joined the rebels  you   what do you mean   rebels    a bunch of deluded  bleeding heart     patriots    trying to bring back the united states   the will lynch you on the spot for this   maybe   or maybe i'll take out general monroe first       hello  grace     come on             rachel   they treating
