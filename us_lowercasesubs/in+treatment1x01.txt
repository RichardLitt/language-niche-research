   i told you    told me what   that you'd be sorry you ever encouraged me to cry here   i'm not sorry at all     didn't expect it to be like this  i bet    like what   you know what  it's disappointing   i thought i'd feel better  relieved     thought it'd be a lot more fun    and it isn't   no  it's horrible   i don't know if i'm gonna be able to talk today  paul   i shouldn't have come  i should have just     i should have just called it off  i'm sorry   are you all right     yeah    sit down  sit   i've been sitting out in the park for about four hours     here    yeah   i wanted to call it off  the session  but     i wasn't sure i'd be able to make it home alone   i took a cab here  my car's at home   god  at least i think it is   yeah  yeah  my car's at home   god  it's freezing  i came this close to knocking on your door and asking for a sweater     when was that    i don't know  maybe five or six   i can't remember  it was still dark   waited for the sun to come up   i never waited this long for a sunrise   except maybe on a camping trip in fifth grade   thank you       you know what i did    what   i held my cellphone and i watched the minutes go by   it felt like forever for one minute to turn into the next   i thought to myself   how stupid is this    dying on a street like roadkill outside your therapist's office    i'm sorry  paul  i     i should have called it off  i shouldn't have come   you should have come here   what happened last night   well  what didn't happen   want the long version or the bottom line   because the bottom line's very simple   my life is over   then you'd better tell me the long version   i left andrew  we had a big blowout    screaming  crying  the works   then at some point  i called ilona   and we went out for a drink  and     we had a few drinks   listen  i'm not here  i'm so totally not here   you are very much here  laura   no  it's not me that's here   believe me  you'd be shocked to know the person that's sitting here   did some     i did some terrible things last night     i feel sick   i don't wanna throw up     doesn't matter  it's no big deal    what do you mean   it's vomit  i'm not gonna vomit all over your rug   it's a cheap rug  laura   let's talk about what's really going on here   hm       it's andrew  he knows i'm here at this time  why is he calling me here   maybe he's worried  you were out all night   yeah  right  if he really cared  he wouldn't have started with this shit   start what   at the club with this guy     oh  my god   he had corduroy pants on   preppy sweater   republican probably       can i just step out for a second and let him know i'm here   i can't concentrate with this shit     just a sec    laura  the call can wait     andrew gave me an ultimatum   either we get married or we split   said he wants an answer in a day or two at the most  or else he's out   said he can't take it any more   that he loves me  that he doesn't believe i love him  not for real   that it's been two years already  on and off  blah  blah  blah   i don't know why  all of a sudden  he just started ranting and raving   we've talked about this stuff before   but it was all in theory   if we stayed together  if   and suddenly out of the blue   i can't even remember what we were doing     we were watching tv   all of a sudden he just gets off the couch  grabs the remote and turns off the tv   and he turns to me and he has tears in his eyes and he says    that's it  i can't take it any more    so out of line  he promised he'd lay off the subject for a while   and all of a sudden he's on this crying bullshit   he actually burst out crying  i've never seen him like that before   and to tell you the truth it really scared me     no  it made me angry    why   he's trying to manipulate me with these cheap chick tricks   maybe he thought he would break my heart or something   or appeal to my     shit  you know  forget it  i don't know   i threw a tantrum like a three year old   i screamed  cried     told him to fuck off     told him he was a little piece of shit for doing this to me  when he knows i'm working double shifts at the hospital this week   i slammed the door  smashed his laptop on the floor  i killed it   i ran out and i called ilona   she dressed me in this outfit   it's  it's not mine   we went out for a drink at a club that she likes on chester street   she tried to calm me down  put things into perspective   and she said     she said that i was lucky     that she wished somebody had loved her enough to give her an ultimatum   and then we drank  well  i drank   and there's this guy at the bar   and at some point ilona said that she was tired and that she needed to go home   and then that guy     moved next to me  and  erm     you know what he said   he said   you look so sad    and i said   really    and he said   yeah  you do  it looks good on you     looks good on you    whatever happened to   do you have the time   or   haven't we met before    i must be totally out of touch  paul   what do you think  i mean  do i look good when i'm sad   i don't think anybody looks good when they're sad   and then  er   i don't know how much i had to drink cos he was ordering for me  of course   and then he paid the bill and he asked me   would you like to go somewhere else    and i said   yes  i'd like to go to the bathroom    so i stood up and i went to the bathroom   he follows me   and you wouldn't believe it but these were unisex bathrooms   am i unlucky or what   how do you mean  unlucky   well  i'm running away from a guy and i'm     you were trying to get away from the guy   i mean  i needed to pee  by myself   i've been doing that since i was three   so i realise i needed to make a decision   by following me to the bathroom  this guy was also giving me an ultimatum   i thought   fuck  out of the pan and into the fire   i ran away from one ultimatum   and there was this guy with a hard on giving me another   suddenly i felt like doing it   i never had sex in a bathroom before   i mean  what  i should go and marry andrew  without ever knowing what a good bathroom fuck's all about   it's part of a young lady's education  isn't it   so you wanted to do it  but not to get back at andrew  just for yourself   that's right   a girl being forced into marriage     what's she supposed to do  die ignorant   so this guy follows me into the stall and     suddenly     i was horny     is hearing about this disgusting to you    no  it's not disgusting   go on   he unzipped  pulled down his pants   and he stood there with this     huge     oh  god  i felt like i was 16     touching it for the very first time   i was really surprised at how     warm it felt   i mean  don't i know that already   and then he turned me round to face the door     and he pulled down my stockings   he lifted up my skirt   put his hand into his back pocket and pulled out a condom   i realise this guy's very good at this  he does this a lot  he's a real pro   and then this guy entered the stall next to us  and started peeing   and gushes full volume like a racehorse   and i thought of andrew     how    how he pees in the morning   making the same sound   my heart ached  i just     it was so stupid  you know  i just felt so sad all of a sudden   and then he's behind me and he's rubbing up against me  and he's feeling me up   and i thought to myself   it's gonna happen any moment now   and i just     i just couldn't do it   i simply closed my legs shut  i couldn't do it  i couldn't do it to andrew   i just couldn't do it   well  seems like quite a night out   well  yeah  that's not the end of it  because this idiot  i told him    i'm really sorry but i have a boyfriend  i can't do this    and he says   boo hoo   and he grabs my hands and he says    listen  cupcake  you think you can leave me high and dry like this   pointing at his dick    the least you can do is make it up to me    i said to him   what do you want  you want some money    he said   give me a hand job   and there'll be no hard feelings    and i said to him   what's the matter with you  are you crazy    and it was just getting really strange  it was tense  his tone changed    and then     and then i thought of you   what you'd say about it   i thought about us going through this in therapy   and what did you imagine us saying   i imagined you not being able to understand it   that you'd be disgusted   is that why you ran over here   to find out if i would be disgusted   i didn't run   i gave him the hand job   god  excuse me        you ok    yeah  yeah  i'm fine     yeah   thank you   we  erm     we talked about what happened at the  er  the club last night  but we never got back to actually talking about andrew  and that argument yesterday   i don't wanna be put in this position   i don't wanna have this power to decide our future for both of us  i just don't   do you have any idea why andrew chose this particular time     what do you mean    do you think that andrew   just out of the blue   as you said yourself  came up with this idea of an ultimatum   did you notice anything over the last couple of days or weeks  that you think might have brought this on   nothing  i don't know  he just lost it   shit  don't you know that men are the new women   obsessed with weddings and children  and lately he's lost touch with reality   he thinks i'm seeing someone  that's how this whole thing started  it's unbelievable   i thought you said it came out of nowhere     you were watching tv and then suddenly      we were watching tv  but  before that  we were having dinner and he had this look on his face  this sad look   and i could tell something was up  you can just tell  right   and i said to him   what's going on   and he said   i don't know what i want    i just know i don't want this on and off thing    so i said to him   sure   and then   let's just decide  either we get married or we split      so you were the one who came up with it    with what     the ultimatum    no  he's the one   he had the problem with the on and off thing   yeah  but on and off can mean several things   you were the one who made it specific    get married or to split up  that was your ultimatum   no  no  no  he had this thing with this on and o     the ultim     yeah  ok  i was the first one to say it  you're right   but he jumped all over it  i said i didn't know what i want  and he said   you have a day or two max to decide what you want    and i said   fine   and then he started crying and blah  blah  blah     the whole thing was scary to him  i think    what about you  weren't you scared     of what    of splitting up   i wasn't suggesting that we split up  that's not the point   so what do you think was the point of this argument that you may have initiated   i didn't initiate anything   no  you may not have meant to  but you did   it sounds like you wanted to bring this relationship into crisis   i know you say that andrew hates uncertainties  but perhaps you're the one who can't live with them   why did you choose this particular time to bring things to a head   i did no such thing   why now   cos he's right   andrew's right   i am being unfaithful to him   you mean what happened last night at the club   not just last night   i've been unfaithful to him for a long time   so  why haven't we talked about this before   i think we have   it's been here all along   you mean to say you've never noticed it   you're surprised   no  i'm not surprised  i just    i don't follow what you mean   this isn't     the reaction i was hoping for   not at all   what was the reaction that you were hoping for   i     i had two scenarios in my head   in the first one  you stand up and you hug me     and you say   i love you    love you too  laura    i've been feeling this way for a long time    i just wanted you to be the first one to say it    and then we make love   and the  erm     the second scenario   it's like the first one but     but without the sex   we just sit here together   you know  i'm embarrassed to even talk about it   you're sitting there like a fucking buddha   acting like you have no idea what i'm talking about  it's humiliating   how long have you felt like this   a year   from the first session   i thought it'd go away  i thought   it's just an infatuation  that's all    but it's getting worse   you've become the centre of my life   laura     i'm your therapist   the parameters and the limitations     are established and ethically defined   i'm not an option   you may be using me as a     as an excuse to bail from your relationship with  with andrew   you know why i didn't fuck that guy   not because of andrew   not because i didn't wanna cheat on him  i do wanna cheat on him   but with you   when i was sitting there at the bar by myself   i was thinking   what would happen if you were to walk in    you'd walk in  you'd sit next to me at the bar  you'd order a drink   i even tried to imagine what you would order   a shot of bourbon  maybe  something expensive  something fancy   then we'd start talking    what a coincidence it is to meet like this    how awkward it is to meet outside the office    and then  without words   because we talk enough when we're here     you motion for me to follow you to the bathroom   and i do   when i went into the stall with that guy     i imagined it was you behind me   that's what made it so exciting   then that guy started peeing  and it woke me up and i realised that it's impossible   i know it  i understand it  i tell myself that every time i walk out of here   i know it  i understand it but i'm not sure that my body understands it   i know it can never happen  i know   so don't worry  i'm not gonna start showing up here   i'm not gonna start stalking you like     glenn close in that movie   i'm not gonna boil your kid's rabbit   i'm not dangerous   at least not to you   god  how can i go back to my life   to the hospital  to andrew   not to andrew when the only thing that matters to me is you     our time's up   yes  it is   i feel like i came here in the dark and i'm leaving into a bigger darkness   what am i gonna do now   we'll talk about it next week   ok   i'll call you a taxi   no  i'm fine   are you sure   how are you going to get home   english sdh
