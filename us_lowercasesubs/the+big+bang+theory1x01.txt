so       with two slits in it and either slit is observed   it will not go through both slits   if it's unobserved  it will   however if it's observed after it's left the plane but before it hits its target   it will not have gone though both slits   agreed  what's your point   there's no point  i just think it's a good idea for a t shirt   excuse me   hang on   uh one across is  aegean     eight down is  nabokov       phylum  which makes 14 across  port au prince   see  papa doc's capitol idea   that's  port au prince     haiti     can i help you    yes   um    is this the high iq sperm bank   if you have to ask  maybe you shouldn't be here   i think this is the place     fill these out    thank you   we'll be right back   oh take your time  i'll just finish my crossword puzzle   oh wait    leonard i don't think i can do this   what are you kidding  you're a semi pro   no  we are committing genetic fraud   there's no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high iq offspring  think about that   i have a sister with the same basic dna mix who hostesses at fuddruckers   sheldon this was your idea   a little extra money to get fractional t 1 bandwith in the apartment   i know  and i do yearn for faster downloads   but there's some poor woman who's gonna pin her hopes on my sperm   what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn't know if he should use an integral or a differential  to solve the area under a curve   i'm sure she'll still love him   i wouldn't   well what do you want to do     i want to leave    okay   what's the protocol for leaving   i don't know  i've never reneged on a proffer of sperm before   let's try just walking out   okay     bye    bye  nice meeting you   are you still made about the sperm bank   no   you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs   not really   if the height of a single step  i don't care   two milli    that doesn't seem right   no it's true  i did a series of experiments when i was 12   my father broke his clavicle   is that why they sent you to boarding school   no  that was a result of my work with lasers     new neighbor    evidently   significant improvement over the old neighbor   a skin condition  yes she is     oh hi    hi     hi    hi     hi    hi   we don't mean to interrupt  we live across the hall   oh that's nice   oh no uh we don't live together   i mean we live together  but in separate   heterosexual bedrooms   oh  okay well guess i'm your new neighbor  penny   oh  leonard  sheldon     hi    hi   hi  hi  hi   well uh    oh uh welcome to the building   oh thank you  maybe we can have coffee sometime     oh great    great     great    great     well uh bye    bye     bye    bye   should we have invited her for lunch   no  we're gonna start season two of battlestar galactica   we already watched the season two dvds   not with commentary   i think we should be good neighbors and invite her over  make her feel welcome   we never invited louie slash louise over   well    and that was wrong of us   we need to widen our circle   i have a very wide circle   i have 212 friends on myspace   yes and you've never met one of them   that's the beauty of it   i'm gonna invite her over   we'll have a nice meal and    chat   chat  we don't chat  at least not offline   well it's not difficult  you just listen to what she says  and then you say something appropriate in response   to what end   hi  again     hi    hi   anyway um    we brought home indian food   and um     i know that moving can be stressful   and and i find that when i'm undergoing stress   that good food and company can have a comforting effect   also  curry is a natural laxative  and i don't have to tell you   that you know a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about   leonard i'm no expert here  but i believe in the context of a luncheon invitation   you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements   oh you're inviting me over to eat   uh    yes   oh that's so nice  i'd love to   great   so what do you guys do for fun around here   well today we tried masturbating for money   our whole universe was in a hot dense state  then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started    wait   the earth began to cool the autotrophs began to drool   neanderthals developed tools we built the wall  we built the pyramids math science history   unraveling the mystery that all started  with a big bang bang    bbs   proudly presents     sync  cflily  bbs    the big bang theoty season 01 episode 01  yourself at home   okay  thank you   you're very welcome   this looks like some serious stuff  leonard did you do this   actually that's my work   wow   yeah  well it's just some quantum mechanics with a little string theory doodling around the edges   that part there  that's just a joke   it's a spoof of the born oppenheimer approximation   so you're like one of those beautiful mind genius guys   yeah   this is really impressive   i have a board  if you like boards  this is my board   holy smokes   if by  holy smokes  you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff  you can find scribbled on the wall of any men's room at mit sure     what    come on   who hasn't seen this differential below  here i sit  broken hearted    at least i didn't have to invent 26 dimensions just to make the mathouome ct   i didn't invent them  they're there   in what universe   in all of them  that is the point   uh    do you guys mind if i start   um    penny     that's where i sit   so sit next to me   no    i sit there     what's the difference    what's the difference   here we go   in the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm   and yet not so close as to cause perspiration in the summer   it's directly in the path of a cross breeze created by opening windows there and there  it faces the television at an angle that is neither direct   thus discouraging conversation   nor so far wide as to create a parallax distortion   i could go on but i think i've made my point   do you want me to move     well      just sit somewhere else   fine   sheldon sit   ah   well this is nice   we don't have a lot of company over   that's not true  koothrappali and wolowitz come over all the time   yes i know but     tuesday night we played klingon boggle till 1 00 in the morning   yeah i remember   i resent you saying we don't have company     i'm sorry    that has negative social implications   i said i'm sorry   so    klingon boggle   yeah  it's like regular boggle but    in klingon   that's probably enough about us  so tell us about you   um    me  okay   i'm a sagittarius  which probably tells you way more than you need to know   yes  it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion  that the sun's apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations at the time of your birth  somehow affects your personality   participate in the what   i think what sheldon's trying to say is that sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess   oh yeah  a lot of people think i'm a water sign  penny   okay let's see  what else   oh i'm a vegetarian  except for fish   and the occasional steak  i love steak   well that's interesting  leonard can't process corn   well uh do you have some sort of a job   oh yeah  i'm a waitress at the cheesecake factory   oh    i love cheesecake   you're lactose intolerant   i don't eat it  i just think it's a good idea   oh  anyways i'm also writing a screenplay   it's about this sensitive girl who comes to l a  from lincoln nebraska   to be an actress and winds up a waitress at the cheesecake factory   so it's based on your life   no i'm from omaha   well if that was movie  i would go see it   i know right   okay let's see what else    um     guess that's about it   that's the story of penny   well it sounds wonderful   it was   until i fell in love with a jerk   what's happening   god you know  four years i lived with him   four years  that's like as long as high school   it took you four years to get through high school   it just    i can't believe i trusted him   should i say something  i feel like i should say something   you  no you'll only make it worse   you want to know the most pathetic part   even though i hate his lying  cheating guts     i still love him   is that crazy   yes   no it's not crazy   it's uh    uh    it's a paradox   paradoxes are part of nature   think about light  if you look at huygens  light is a wave   as confirmed by the double   slit experiments   but then along comes albert einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too   well i didn't make it worse   i'm so sorry  i'm such a mess   on top of everything else  i'm all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn't even work   our shower works   really  would it be totally weird if i used it   yes     no    no     no    no   it's right down the hall   thanks  you guys are really sweet   well this is an interesting development   how so   it has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment   that's not true  remember at thanksgiving my grandmother with alzheimer's had that episode   point taken  it has been some time since we've had a woman take her clothes off   after which we didn't want to rip our eyes out   the worst part was watching her carve that turkey   so what exactly are you trying to accomplish here   excuse me   that woman in there is not going to have sex with you   well i'm not trying to have sex with her   oh good  then you won't be disappointed   what makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me   i'm a male and she's a female   yes but not of the same species   i'm not going to engage in hypotheticals here   i'm just trying to be a good neighbor   oh of course   that's not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that i wouldn't participate   however briefly   do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered  when she discovers your luke skywalker no more tears shampoo   it's darth vader shampoo   luke skywalker's the conditioner   wait till you see this   it's fantastic  unbelievable   see what   it's a stephen hawking lecture from mit in 1974   this isn't a good time   it's before he became a creepy computer voice  leonard   that's great  you guys have to go   why   it's just not a good time   leonard has a lady over   yeah right  your grandmother back in town   no  and she's not a lady   she's just a new neighbor   hang on there really is a lady here   uh huh   and you want us out because you're anticipating coitus   i'm not anticipating coitus   so she's available for coitus   can we please just stop saying  coitus    technically that would be  coitus interruptus     hey is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower      oh hi  sorry  hello   enchant  mademoiselle   howard wolowitz caltech department of applied physics   you may be familiar with some of my work   it's currently orbiting jupiter's largest moon taking high resolution digital photographs   penny  i work at the cheesecake factory   come on i'll show you the trick with the shower   bonne douche   i'm    i'm sorry   it's french for  good shower     it's a sentiment i can express in six languages   save it for your blog howard               all right  there it goes  it sticks  i'm sorry   okay thanks   reyou' welcome  oh you're just going to step right    okay i'll       hey leonard      the hair products are sheldon's   okay   um can i ask you a favor   a favor   sure you can ask me a favor  i would do you a favor for you   it's okay if you say no   oh i'll probably say yes   it's just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you just met   wow   i really think we should examine the chain of causality here   must we   event a  a beautiful woman stands naked in our shower   event b  we drive halfway across town to retrieve a television set  from the aforementioned woman's ex boyfriend   query  on what plane of existence is there even a semi rational link between these events   she asked me to do her a favor sheldon   ah yes  well that may be the proximal cause of our journey   but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause   which is   you think with your penis   that's a biological impossibility   and you didn't have to come   oh right yes i could have stayed behind and watch wolowitz try to hit on penny in russian  arabic and farsi   why can't she get her own tv   come on you know how it is with breakups   no i don't    and neither do you   i broke up with joyce kim   you did not break up with joyce kim  she defected to north korea   to mend her broken heart   this situation is much less complicated   there's some kind of dispute between penny and her ex boyfriend as to who gets custody of the tv   she just wanted to avoid having a scene with him   so we get to have a scene with him   no sheldon there's not going to be a scene   there's two of us and one of him   leonard the two of us can't even carry a tv   so you guys work with leonard and sheldon at the university   um i'm sorry  do you speak english   oh he speaks english  hecaust jn't speak to women   really  why   he's kind of a nerd   juice box   i'll do the talking  man   yeah   uh hi i'm leonard  this is sheldon     hello    let's     uh we're here to pick up penny's tv   get lost   okay thanks for you time   we're not going to give up just like that   leonard the tv's in the building   we have been denied access to the building  ergo we are done   excuse me   if i were to give up on the first little hitch i never would have been able to identify the fingerprints  of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang   my apologies  what's your plan   it's just a privilege to watch your mind at work   come on we have a combined iq of 360   we should be able  what do you think their combined iq is   just grab the door   this is it   i'll do the talking   good thinking  i'll just be the muscle   yeah   i'm leonard  this is sheldon   from the intercom   how the hell did you get in the building   uh    we're scientists   tell him about our iq     leonard      what   my mom bought me those pants   i'm sorry   you're going to have to call her   sheldon i am so sorry i dragged you through this   it's okay  it wasn't my first pantsing and it won't be my last   and you were right about my motives   i was hoping to establish a relationship with penny that might have someday led to sex   well you got me out of my pants   anyway i've learned my lesson   she's out of my league  i'm done with her   got my work one day i'll win the nobel prize and then i'll die alone   don't think like that  you're not going to die alone   thank you sheldon  you're a good friend   and you're certainly not going to win a nobel prize   this is one of my favorite places to kick back after a quest   they have a great house ale   wow a cool tiger   yeah i've had him since level ten   his name is buttons   anyway if you had your own game character we could hang out  maybe go on a quest   sounds interesting   so you'll think about it   oh i don't think i'll be able to stop thinking about it   smooth   we're home   oh my god what happened   well your ex boyfriend sends his regards and i think the rest is fairly self explanatory   i'm so sorry   i really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass   no it was a valid hypothesis   that was a valid     what is happening to you   really    thank you so much for going and trying   you're so terrific   really   why don't you get some clothes on  i'll get my purse  and dinner is on me okay     really  great    thank you   you're not done with her are you   are babies will be smart and beautiful   not to mention imaginary      with you penny    sure   we can't have thai food  we had indian for lunch   so   they're both curry based cuisines   so   it would be gastronomically redundant   i can see we're going to have to spell out everything for this girl   any ideas raj   uh turn left on lake street and head up to colorado   i know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke   that sounds like fun   baby baby don't get hooked on me  oh baby baby don't get hooked on me     i don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole   but as far as the population of this car goes   you're a veritable
