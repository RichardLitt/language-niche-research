 oh  boy am i glad to see you guys   we are sorely ill prepared for this kind of deal   quail hunter's dog found her this morning at 5 30   wasn't meant to be hunting quail but he was     do we know who she is     nope  looks familiar though so i'm guessing local   people sure look different when they're dead   though don't they   that wound doesn't look fatal   there's no ligature marks on the neck   so she wasn't strangled or hung  gums are livid   eyes are hemorrhaged     suffocation     my bet is it's a meth head from the city    coming in off the interstate     no he's a local   and it was an accident     her killer didn't intend her to die this way     how so   she still has her clothes on  her abductor was taking her  to a location that was quiet and private  so he could undress her for a sexual assault   she made too much noise at the wrong moment   he tried to keep her quiet and smothered her by mistake   no good to him now so then he dumps her in a spot  only a local would know   she's all yours  thanks for waiting   why sexual motive  could be gangs or drugs   a drug trade smothering  by who     sesame street  crips   there's nothing to say it isn't just boyfriend trouble   could be boyfriend trouble  doesn't feel like it though     who is this guy     he's a consultant   you want cbi assistance  he comes as part of the package   consultant huh   what are you clairvoyant or some gizmo   you got psychic powers   no no powers  had them once   i mean i pretended i had them obviously   no such thing as psychic powers   so what is it you do exactly   you know

the night before last   she waitresses at the shand creek winery restaurant   she was on until 11 00   her car is still parked there in the parking lot   we're always asleep when she comes home   we didn't even know she was missing until the morning   we called all her friends and nobody knew where she was   nobody'd seen her after she left work that night   she was all set to go to college in the fall   she won a softball scholarship  at um u c l a   we were worried about her going down to los angeles   because you read about all the crime   did they do anything to her   doesn't appear so  she was fully clothed   why would anybody do something like that   oftentimes the first name that pops into the mother's head  is the guilty party   jealous boyfriends anything like that   no  no nothing like that   nothing   she was always shy of boys   she was a good girl   she took the purity pledge in ninth grade   and she still wears that ring today   when did she take the posters down     after christmas     who was on the posters   boys with long hair from the tv   she didn't like them anymore   said they were for little girls   do you know who killed her   no   are you gonna find out who killed her   me and my colleagues are gonna try   how   looking listening asking questions   when you find him will you tell me   sure  why   no reason     rigsby     van pelt     hey did you

like you said   why don't i drive down there give you guys a hand   no you stay there  look i'll call you if i need you   she has a lover    someone she met around christmas at a fair   he's either too old too closely related or too villainous  to tell her folks about  i'd bet on villainy   and his first name starts with an  h    explains why she wasn't wearing a purity ring   you know it is the damndest thing   i was at the shand creek that night on a call  round about the same time that girl was taken     a drunk wouldn't pay his check     that is the damndest thing   you notice anything that might be useful   oh for crying out loud   yeah when i got there i saw a black truck   full size taking off out of the other end of that lot  going way too fast     nearly went after him too you know   what time was that   uh a quarter to 12 00   have these woods been checked   not to speak of   you might want to put a few man hours into that   uh huh   that uh that's her car right there   you want to take it   she worked for us for    three summers in a row   lovely girl   this is good     yes it is     it's unbelievable   and from the parking lot  i was practically right there   i can't even think about it  mm hmm   try this     no i won't     this one's really good   to your knowledge did melanie ever have any incidents  with disgruntled coworkers maybe    mmm     boyfriend problems     no   mmm this one is really good  cardamom     yes and caraway     mmm and a lot of butter   shh   no there's no shame in it  a lot of butter   that's the great thing about food   it's indulgence and necessity all in one   what time did melanie leave work that night   to build a time line we need to know exactly   well i know she took off first   but i'd have to check her time card to be exact   hey it wasn't me by the way   i have a staff of 20 that'll tell you  the only time i ever leave the kitchen is to take a leak    or yell at a customer     sad but true   so this is the uh the kitchen   this is the main prep area     and this is where the magic happens     ow   hey  attention randall  pay it   my office is this way     this is a go  this is a go     all right   she was by no means a gifted server    betty butterfingers  that's what we called her   but she had a good spirit   she left at 11 25   good night   she went out that door  and that's the last we saw of her   it's all reservations i assume   credit cards     yes  i can get you a full list     great   oh raquel come in  these people are here  to help find out what happened to poor melanie   okay  good   you and she were good friends weren't you   not really  she was okay   oh   cause on her wall at home   she has a picture of you and her together   that's weird huh   i don't know why she has a picture of me and her ma'am   maybe she has a secret crush on me     i don't know     what's her boyfriend's name   she doesn't have a boyfriend  that's her thing right     purity  no boys     so who was it that she cut out of the picture     i don't know sir     you were there   it was christmas  i was high   raquel this is a murder investigation   if you protect someone who did this you'll do time   i'm sorry ma'am  i can't help you   i would if i could  swear to god   thank you   car's clean   have a chat with raquel why don't you   i'm gonna go check the credit card receipts     okay     give me a minute with her     she's got a super low threshold     no  nope   just stand in the doorway pretend you're making    a phone call for a moment     no  it's illegal and it's unprofessional   that's why i need you to stand in the doorway   one minute   raquel look at me   before you fall asleep tonight while you're lying in your bed  relaxing and slowly drifting off into sleep   i want you to think of me   think of me and imagine that you can fly   imagine that you're weightless   you can float gently into the air if you want to   safe and calm and serene   you can fly away and leave all your burdens  and worries and fears behind you   imagine that    what a nice feeling it is   next time you see me when i say hello   you'll remember that good feeling   and you'll want to tell me the truth   because when you do tell the truth you'll feel  that a heavy weight has been lifted from your shoulders   i'll say hello and you will feel as light as a feather   as if you were floating on air   why don't you sit here a moment think about that  before you go back to work   whatever   your friend's crazy  can i go now   yes   worked on the chicken   right   maybe that's a clue    sorry    hmm   take it to the lab   whoa whoa wait  i    i got a better idea   um settle down now everyone  settle down   these are agents  of the california bureau of investigation     they want to talk to you a moment     there's nothing to worry about  oh   we need your help   will you help us   yes   we know the identity of melanie's killer   the murderer of that poor girl is in this room   this note     was found in melanie's locker   we have strong reason to believe that whoever wrote this note  is the killer   yes unluckily for that person my colleague   agent cho here is the bureau's chief graphologist   each one of you will be giving us a sample of your handwriting   left and right handed   cho will examine these samples  and determine which of you left this note   which of you is the killer     oh     oh   randall     back it up     don't crowd him   randall   voil   randall why did you want to say  sorry  to melanie     i didn't kill her     i didn't say that you did   i asked why you wanted  to say  sorry  to her   your time card and your boss  say you left work ten minutes before melanie   you waited for her in the parking lot right  right   there's no law against waiting for someone  you waited for her     i just wanted to speak to her     nothing wrong with that   you wanted to speak to her  then what happened   i was like  hey melanie what's up    and we talked  she didn't leave   she    she was smiling and laughing   so i figured i was doing pretty good   so i made my move   and um she wasn't so into it which was cool   only i know she has this whole virgin thing happening   so i figured that i just have to be more     goal oriented   she was pretty upset   so i apologized for any misunderstanding and i left  bitch   i got in my car and i drove off and that was it   only i felt like maybe she would still be mad at me  and like complain   so when i got in to work this morning   before i knew that she was missing i wrote   sorry   and i put it in her locker   how long were you in the parking lot with her     try and be precise     five minutes  six   randall tried to kiss melanie because he thought  it was on his account that she didn't leave     but in fact she didn't leave because of randall     she was meeting somebody else   are we gonna see raquel again   she's on her way in now   hey   hey  i did the database search  i'm e mailing the results   i'm gonna put you on speaker   it's not much  one pop for the brand of silver tape  used two months ago in fairfield    an abduction case   what happened  delores sanchez a female 22   migrant farm laborer abducted at a bus stop   she doesn't know how   she wakes up on a bed  in a motel room all tied up in duct tape unharmed   the cleaners found her  never saw her abductors  no suspects   fairfield p d  concluded it was a drunken prank   the complainant sanchez left town     so the case kind of drifted away     this is very interesting     let's knock off on tangents already     any other correlations     uh yes actually  sanchez is a redhead like o'keefe     uh huh   cool down  it's a common brand of tape   and there's a quarter million redheaded women in california   yeah yeah you're right  yeah   just supposing for fun   that it was the same guy did both crimes   he kidnaps a redheaded girl ties her up takes her  to a motel room has her at his mercy but does nothing   months later kidnaps another redheaded girl   but his planning is not good enough   and he kills her in a panic to keep her quiet     what does that say     he's an idiot   he's new to this and he's conflicted   he's hungry to do terrible things   but his conscience and his fear tell him not to   so he's not yet going into this with the proper focus  and planning and stuff goes wrong   or you're making that up   and melanie was murdered by her secret lover   we can be fairly certain she was meeting  at the exact time of her abduction   excuse me  i'm still here     what would you like me to do     call all the motels within 10 miles of shand creek   find one that had a cash booking who didn't show    on the night of the murder     no let's work the solid leads first   cross check all the full size black trucks    with known criminals in the napa area     yes ma'am   look if the boyfriend angle doesn't work   we'll look at your trainee psychopath okay     okay     i don't know anything so i can't tell anything   i told them that  i told you i don't know anything   has a seat miss garcia   thanks   hello raquel   melanie had a thing with hector romerez   he's my second cousin   i was with him at the fair one time   and we ran into melanie and then they were like bam     romeo and juliet   she was meeting him that night     the night she died     yes   and i didn't tell you because i'm afraid of him   the eight ball locos   he runs all the drugs in vacaville   and he's had people killed for way less  than just snitching on him like this for real   that was funny   the way she gave him up so easily like that   yeah it was   but you were right huh  secret lover   guess i was wrong about the whole red hair and duct tape thing   you hypnotized her didn't you   i certainly did not   okay  no   yes i did hypnotize her but     but nothing  it's unprofessional     and it's illegal  it's totally out of bounds     that's what i told him   i was gonna say you had nothing to do with it   you allow him to pull that stuff again   and you'll be showing visitors around the statehouse in a stupid hat   yes ma'am  understood   rigsby i got a hot warrant in vacaville     you can get there in an hour can't ya     yes boss  i'll get rolling   bring van pelt  yes bo    for a hot warrant   why are you  still on the line   hey come on  let's go   there's strawberry   you like that one   sheriff's department  we have a warrant  open up   don't move   he's out  he's out   put your right hand  behind your back   boom  out of nowhere  guy didn't know what hit him   so what were you planning to do if lisbon hadn't stopped him   oh i    i didn't bother to formulate a plan     i    i knew she'd stop him     cho jane let's move   you two fill out the paperwork with the staties     then go back to sacramento hold the fort     yes boss   hector we're investigating the murder of melanie o'keefe   do you know who she was   she was suffocated and then stabbed to death  and dumped on the side of the road three nights ago   we know you and melanie were lovers   we know you were planning to meet her that night   and we can put your truck in the shand creek parking lot   i've got enough to charge you with hector   w   we just want to know  your side of the story   how'd you two meet   oprah and dr  phil here   i told her this is how it was going to end   only it was going to be me that died  and her sitting here with dumb cops  asking dumb questions    why was a respectable girl like you  with a thug like hector romerez    why was she   you wouldn't understand   sure she would   all women understand the charm of a violent man   what we had was special   you made her feel like a captured princess  instead of a small town choir nerd   and she made you feel like a dashing pirate  instead of what you are     sort of a bad tempered pharmacist   funny man   those pirates back then   they were just banging like anybody else today   a pirate is exactly what i am   and she was a princess   she was   what happened that night   we were supposed to meet at 11 30 at the restaurant   i got there ten minutes late   and she hadn't come out yet   i waited for a few minutes and i left   i'm impatient   i was angry   i will always hate myself for that   i left her to be killed because i don't wait for nobody   that's a noble admission hector   how did you feel about the fact she was going to college in the fall   i was proud  and happy for her   she was leaving you behind   i wanted her to leave me behind   i wanted her far away  i told her  go to l a   and don't come back for nothing      he's telling the truth     and now you're just trying to be contrary     have you read his sheet     did you hear what he said   he's a good actor  it was you who thought it was him in the first place   i said melanie had a secret lover     i didn't say he killed her     if it wasn't him then who was it   and if you say a man who likes red hair and silver duct tape     i'll scream     i don't want you to scream   look you have your reasons  i understand   but you're seeing more than what's actually there   you have a tendency to do that   not every murder is a secret inside of a secret  inside of a secret  there's not always a hidden pattern   not always but sometimes there is   sometimes the obvious guy did it   most of the time the obvious guy did it   look at the time line   hector's admitted he was in the parking lot for ten minutes give or take   there wasn't enough time for anybody else  to have entered the parking lot   abducted melanie and driven away  it was hector   you're right  there's no time   hey frankie   so uh show me   show you what   your gun     i don't have a gun     no     hey van pelt     hey   lisbon changed her mind     she wants you to check out those motels like i said     the motels   looking for one with a no show cash booking that night   cover all the bases she says   she's right here if you want a word with her     uh that's okay but listen i       call me first if you get anything   no gun huh   what were you gonna kill hector with a knife   that should work   put it away   what if it turns out  that hector isn't the man who killed your sister   isn't he   we don't know that yet  but you don't have to worry about that   that's for us to work out   you need to be here for your family  and leave the vengeance part to us   when you find who did it for sure will you kill him   no   i won't kill him but i'll make him very sorry   i have a daughter who'd be about your age  if i hadn't caused her death     her and her mother   how   out of arrogance     stupidity   i made an evil man very angry   and he killed them to teach me a lesson   to make me sorry for what i'd done   and i am sorry   being sorry is a far worse punishment than being dead   everybody dies   very few people ever feel truly sorry  for the bad things they've done   it hurts   van pelt what do you got   microwave spa tub and premium cable in every unit   special rates for state and federal employees   what did he look like    this man   big with a hat and sunglasses     and a thick beard like a sikh   an absurd disguise in other words   ridiculous   i run a motel  i don't care who you are   he bought a good beard for nothing   then that night he doesn't show   so i remembered him when your nice young lady called   uh no disrespect but uh your maid isn't very thorough   no she is most thorough  she cleans here tomorrow     for monthly rentals she       monthly   yes  she comes every third day   so he's been here recently in the last two days   the chips would imply this yes   yes they    they would   this   oh th    those are not ours   he's coming back   okay  thank you   nice work   hey   listen i don't want to make you mad   but i found something really interesting   and i want you to take a look at it   you can't make me mad  go ahead  what'd you find   you first  who made you so happy   forensics   traces of melanie's blood  on the seat of hector's truck   oh  so    happy day   yeah  now i'm gonna go and see what hector has to say about it   what'd you find   oh  uh it    it can wait   blood  yes   last time i saw her two weeks ago   she was disrespectful so i had to tune her up     she got a bloody nose     was physical abuse  a normal occurrence in your relationship   or is this more of a recent thing   she chose me   she wanted to know where the edges are   i showed her   go ahead  say it     i think he's telling the truth     and i disagree  i'm charging him   no  yes  good  that's good  go ahead   you got more than enough evidence   oops nearly forgot   okay tell me  what'd you find   telling you won't do  i have to show you   hi   uh i made a booking for two for this afternoon   could you put us on the terrace   it's more romantic   thanks   yeah  patrick   lovely  see you then   don't fret  i wouldn't seduce you over a meal   that would be very sophomoric   i didn't think you were trying to seduce me   come on   how could that thought not have entered your head   your denial that it did intrigues me   bite me   what is this   uh     that's van pelt  what is she doing   this is a live feed from the shand creek restaurant   and this is how we're gonna catch melanie's killer   mm   say again   nothing   oh i see you     how do i look     good  you look good     i meant can you see the wire     oh  um     uh     nope  nope   the killer plans to bring his victim back to this room   and when he does we're gonna be here to greet him  how sweet is that   this is all a big elaborate joke you're gonna apologize for now     yes     whoever killed melanie had to be there that night at shand csreek   your time line proves it   there's no way anyone else could've done it   one of the 20 people there that night killed melanie   all 20 of those people are there now today     including the killer     and he's gonna try it again today     come on     no no  yes yes that's just the point   yes he is gonna try again  he's planning on it   and he's gonna try again today  because we are gonna make him try again  because he's not in control of his desires   he's been thinking of nothing else  but this perverse craving of his   he's gotten so close  he's desperate to go all the way   all we need to do is present him with something he can't resist   something that he will jump at and damn the consequences   give it a try  if i'm wrong there's no harm down   this is a kooky menu   it's fusion   confusion   up to me make it a cheeseburger every time   oh me too  with onion rings   let's do it     not yet     why not   this is actually quite good   aah   oh   ow   you're meant to shout at me  and leave   now you've gone too

yeah   it's fascinating the way your mind works   one thing though   malcolm was in the kitchen with 20 people  when melanie was taken  he couldn't have done it   hang on  there   there's a way he could     forgive me if i can't stay for more of your theorizing   but i've gotta go and see if i can save your colleagues  from getting formal complaints in their files   hey  yeah i'll be right
