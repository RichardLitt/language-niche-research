started  right after her foster parents brought her back  to quarantine last week   well  what kind of complaints   well  for instance   yesterday  maia was talking to an employee in the cafeteria   she told her her daughter would be  in the hospital soon  but that she'd be okay   the next day  the little girl was in a car accident   so you're saying what   she she's got some kind of second sight   i'm saying i have five stories just like that one   tom  why disappear  a little girl from the 1940s   hold her for 60 years  and then send her back  with the ability to predict the future   i mean  what were they thinking    they   we don't even know if there is a  they    he  she  it   take your pick   somebody's behind this   you know  let's leave that  for the team in the theory room  huh   yeah   when they're not playing video games   oh  that's why they're intimidated by you  tom   they feel your hostility   good   i wouldn't worry too much about the big brains   just talk to that girl   thanks   i never meant to scare anymore   we know that  sweeti  but why did you say those things  to mrs  krause about her daughter   because they're true   but how did you know   i just do   if i asked you  whether it was going to rain next sunday   would you know the answer   maybe   i don't know   what's going to happen to me now   the doctors here are going to take another look at you   oh  don't worry  it won't hurt   i don't believe you   it's going to hurt  isn't it   you might be uncomfortable some of the time   but mostly  oh  it's just going to be boring   will  you look in on me every now and then   me   to see that i'm all right   sure   li  it's expensive  though   the rental vouchers will cover it   man  so    do you  have any questions   lily  um   the small bedroom    do you think it'll get too much light  for a nursery  i mean   it's a northern exposure   so you should be all right   so  what do you think   i like it   me  too   is this your first baby   oh  we're not actually a couple   oh  uh  so  it's just you and the baby   no  it'll be the three of us   why not   you can't stay in that hotel forever   we can share this place   unless you don't want to   no   no  i'd like that   m an  great   i'll go do the paperwork   i hope i didn't barrass you   no  it's    it's not that   it's  uh     it's just  i figure he wouldn't rentou the place  if i was part  the deal   i know  i know   it's not 1951 anymore   times have changed  but     sometimes i'm just surprised at how much   good   it's settled then   oh  god   lily  lily  what is it   no   oh   lily   no  i    i don't feel so good   you need to sit down   should i call a doctor   no  no   no  i    i just have to leave   and go where   anywhere but here   carl  where have you been   i got mugged   oh  god  are you all right   did they hurt you   no  i didn't get hurt  they got hurt   who did   grace  i learned something tonight   something important   i'm a different man   those aliens   or whoever took me    they did something   they took me  they changed me   they made me better   i think first thing in the morning  you should call the counselor and make an appointment   what  no  i don't have time for that   i got things to do   what kind of things   the park  gracie   i want to make it like it was before   people will bring their kids there again   you and me    we can have our picnics at the old spot   carl  you're scaring me   there's nothing to be scared of  not anymore   linda  any idea  why dr  mayhew wants to see us   he didn't say     so how have you been   good   my lawyer was asking if you'd signed those divorce papers yet   i thought maybe if we had dinner some night   you know  we could    sign them together   oh  you mean make plans that you'd cancel  at the last minute   i'll bring the papers   we'll have a good meal   a couple glasses of wine     and a good cry   that  too   stefano's     where else   dr  mayhew  tom  linda   thanks for coming in   i was reviewing carl's eeg readout   and i noticed something peculiar   what now   well  it seems last thursday night  he had a momentary burst of increased brain activity   it was brief   no more than a few seconds   that's good  isn't it   technically  yes   let's not get ahead of ourselves   i'm going to run some tests   see if i can find out what happened   tests   we've had  three years of tests   i understand your frustration  linda   but we really need to look into this   it's a roller coaster  isn't it   it never ends   linda     so  stefano's  right   how does thursday night sound  70   i'll be there   dorothy    yeah   did anyone visit my son last thursday night  besides his mother and me   let me check   yes  he had one other visitor   your nephew shawn   shawn   yeah  i went and s kyle on thursday night   he's my cousin   i wanted to see him   what about it   and nothing happened while you were there   well  i was ly there for a couple minutes   so  you saw nothing  did nothing   what could i have done   the day of your welcome home party  a bird  smacked into the window  remember   yeah  it was stunned   at about it   no  it wasore than that   and then    you picked it up  and suddenly  it was alive and well   what the hell did you do to kyle     i didn't do anything to him   look  look  i really like  these little chats we have  uncle tommy   but i got to go to class   shawn   we'll  talk again   oh  i can't wait   a bunch of us are going to see  fountains of wayne this weekend   have fun   you know  um  this whole loner thing is so tired   well  it works for me   fountains of wayne   friday night   what is with you   why do you keep pushing him like that   someone has to   i don't see you doing anything   well  i'm giving him his space   let him figure things out for himself   you should try it sometime   oh      marco   skouris   good   i checked out your idea   what idea   so  am i a genius  or am i crazy   we don't make that distinction in here   of disappearance sites on the west coast  like you suggested   turns out you were right   the avity at those sites is weaker   but according to the interferometer   only by five parts per billion   that's barely measurable   not to mention barely understandable   english  please   the gravity is changed  at some of the places where people disappeared   the question is did it change naturally   or was it articially manipulated   now  if the gravity was manipulated   the question then becomes by who   skouris  so we're back to  the possibility of alien abductions   i wouldn't rule out little green men   but obviously i'm going to need to take more measurements   so  in other words  you've made no progress   uh  you explain it to him   oh  hold on   you remember adam kensington   the  uh  insurance guy orson bailey killed   yeah  what about him   not one of the good guys  as it turns out   he was point man in a huge insurance scheme  to defraud tens of thousands of policyholders   orson bailey saved the state of washington  like  a billion dollar buyout   could've been enron all over again   god  that's interesting   'cause that brings up all kinds of possibilities   well  uh  don't be a stranger   oh     so  this thing about bailey   are you trying to say whoever sent him back  meant him to go after kensington   it's a theory   that's why they call it  the theory room        that's tight   oh  no  i suck   hey  if this is about the  uh  concert thing     no  no  no  it's got nothing to do about that   i just want to know  what's going on with you and nikki     me and nikki what   i just want to know what's going on between you two   well  what do you think's going on   something   she's always talking about you   can't go anywhere or do anything  without her wanting to bring you along   how is that my problem  danny   just do me a favor   leave her alone  okay     oh     i thought that's what i've been doing   look  danny  you got a problem with your girlfriend   go talk to her about it  okay   hey  uh     we're the same age   i'm not your little brother anymore   then stop ting like a two year old   you're my brother   she's your girlfriend   it's all good     right   yeah  right     lily  oh  richard  i am so glad we found this place   and now that we got an apartment   we can get you a computer   richard  forget abouthe computer   i still think we need to get you to a doctor   i'm fine   i know this is going to sound strange   but that other place we looked at    the baby didn't like it     marnal instinct's kicking in already  huh   no  it's not that   it's that somehow    i know what the baby's thinking   lily  the baby's barely two months along   it's not thinking anything   look  i can't explain it any more than you can explain     where you've been for the past 50 years  or  or what's happened to any of us  during the time we've been gone   i don't sound too strange  do i   of course not   lily   i used to rock heidi like that when she was a baby   it feels like yesterday  but it wasn't  was it   no   it was    what  11 years ago   i want to see heidi   i miss her   lily  give it some time   once brian is used to you being back   he'll drop the restraining order         man  shut up  just shut up   stop it  cut it out   it isn't funny   shut up  just shut up   grab her legs  man   hey  guys   why don't you leave her alone   get lost   no   you get lost   go get him  man  come on       hey  maia   how long have they left you like this   a while   i think they all wt on their coffee break     well  you know     that's pretty dumb of them  isn't it   will you stay until they come back   of course   and when they show up  your doctors and i   we're going to have a little talk   and then can i go home   home   with you   i don't like being here alone   you want to come and stay with me   you don't like being alone  either   i can always come back  for my checkups   please   look  maia     i'm not even sure  i'm the kind of person i want to live with   no  i i eat cold pizza for breakfast and     that sounds all right to me   yeah  you know  maia     just let me think about it  okay     where have you been   i was loing in on maia   really   well  i promised her  didn't i   so  what do you got   sid e mailed the latest rearch clippings to us   i think i found something worth checking out   one guy taking on three attackers  doesn't sound that farfetched   i know  but if you saw him  you'd think it was impossible   he was  uh  35  40   maybe 5'6    wehed 150 pounds   so not exactly the rock  huh   but it was the way that he moved   could he have been on  some kind of drug  maybe pcp   he didn't act like he was on drugs   you know   most guys would have walked away   or  uh  maybe called the cops   later  after it was  too late  but  uh     this guy   he saved me     tom  i'm sorry   baldwin   linda   dinner  yeah  no   linda  i'm so     don't hang up  linda   just  just     is there anything else you can remember   there is one thing   this guy   i don't mean to be rude or anything   but  uh  he smelled funny   like day old fish   so that was your wife on the phone   excuse me    i don't want to talk about it   fair enough   so what  are we  in orson bailey territory here   well  i wouldn't rule it out   which would give us what   a telekinetic insurance salesman   a clairvoyant eight year old  and now some kind of sad sack super vigilante   hell of a trio   and those are only the ones we know about   unss you can think of anyone else   just take it one case at a time   heidi  do you remember the formula  for an isosceles triangle   hey  buddy   i saw that         richard     lily   thank god  are you all right   i been worried sick  where are you   i've been arrested   carl     i have my grandchildren coming for dinner   uh  how 'bout some nice swordfish   you can't go wrong with swordfish   carl   uh  give me a second  burt   you got  like     what did i tell you about  chatting with customers when there's work to be done   stop with the finger  stop     i asked you  not to do that     let go   i mean it   i show up on time  i do my work   now just leave me alone  okay   okay  okay   so  how much swordsh are we talking here   i'm telling you  tom   there's a lot of chatter in dc  about putting the 4400 back in quarantine   not that i agree   i mean  if they're so dangerous   how is cramming th all into one space  going to make us any safer   so i took my pistol and i shot her in the forehead   shot who     do us a favor  tom   sign the divorce papers   do me a far  dennis   stay out of it   i spoke to her   what are you doing talking to linda   i've known her for 20 years   i danced with her at your wedding   now i'm not supposed to talk to her   i was in the middle of an investigation   tom  you asked her for dinner  and you stood her up   it slipped my mind   maybe   maybe you just don't want to admit the truth to yourself   brian moore   yeah   i'm richard tyler  a friend of lily's   are you another one of those 4400   is that a problem   look   i warned her  i told her to stay away   but she wouldn't listen   i understandou're set   but lily's in jail   you don't want that   what i want is a normal life  r my daughter  for my family   e made a mistake  it won't happen again   i'm just supposed to take your word for it   i promise  you drop the charges     she'll never bother you or heidi ever again   you used to love her once  remember   yeah  i remember   i want you to stop   i can't   what do you mean   can't    what you're doing  is dangerous  not to mention illegal   you can't just  go around beating people up   i've been given an oppornity here  gracie   and i'm going to take it   i'm going to clean up that park  and when i'm finished   i'm going to clean up the whole neighborhood   oh  god   you sound like a crazy man   you promised me you'd call your counselor   i never said that  you said that   come tomorrow  i'm going to call him   you'd call homeland security on me   if that's what it takes   the way you're acting  can you blame me   what i'm doing here i'm doing for us  grace   this is where we live   i just want us to be happy and to not be afraid anymore   and it starts with bradley park   and i don't want it to end there   it won't  i won't let it   they can't hurt me  no one can   oh     you're just one man   i lost you once   and i don't want to lose you again   i can do it   i can make this neighborhood safe again   for you  for mrs  martino     even burt   so please  stop worrying   this is what i was meant to do   this is my destiny        or is this your way      to hide a broken heart       many dreams      have been brought to your doorstep      they just lie there      and they die there      are you warm  are you real      mona lisa       this was brand new when i disappeared   and it's a     what'd you call it  a      golden oldie     oh   i guess i'm a golden oldie  too   no  not to me   lily  we have to talk about what happened last night   no  there's nothing to talk about   do you know what i saw  when i looked through brian's window   a happy family   i realized heidi doesn't need me   well  maybe one day she     yeah  i'll be there r her  if she does   but until then  i     i'll stay away   this is where i want to be now   here with you   where i'm happy   and the baby's happy   well  that makes three happy people then   all you've done for me     it's not because i remind you  of the other lily  is it   maybe at first   but now all i see is you     mona lisa      mona lisa         danny's inside   i'm not here to see danny     cute  could you turn it back on  please   did danny say something to you   is that why you're acting like this   because our friendship  has nothing to do with him     nikki     we don't have a friendship  okay   shawn  listen to me         hey  hey  hey  come here   let me see  let me see  let me see what's going on   it's okay  it's okay  let me see   it's gone   it doesn't hurt anymore   must not have been that bad of a burn   yes  it was   you did something to it idn't you        and be the one who catches all your tears      that's why i need you to hear      i've found out a reason for me      to change who i used to be      a reason to start over new        and the reason is you       tom   see  the thing about vigilantes  is that they're not very common   except in charles bronson movies   so i had to create my own profile   now  we know he's a white male  slender   somewhere between  he probably works a blue collar job   suffers from low self esteem  lives in a high crime area   i'm with you so far   right  so i cross  checked my profile  with the members of the 4400  in and around the seattle area   and i came up with 37 names   you're not going to take me through all 37  are you   of those 37  i was able to eliminate 24    i'm sure you don't care how    and that left me with 13   i'm on the edge of my seat   here are my o favorites   robert laurenzano and carl morrissey   they both fit the profile   but carl   he's our guy   check out his occupation   supermarket employee   yeah  i called the store   carl works in the seafood section   and our guy smelled like day old fish   oh  yeah  i'm good   hey   what the hell you doing   i just cleaned that       carl  what   do you know  where your husband is   we'd like to talk to him   why   any idea where he was tuesday night   he was here   you sure about that   i just told you   have you heard of the bradley park vigilante   wh what does that have to do with carl   you tell us  mrs  morrissey     you're not going to throw him back into quarantine  are you   we want to help him   that's funny  that's all carl wants to do is help   people grumble  they complain  nobody does anything   nobody tries to make anything better except carl   where is he  mrs  morrissey   carl   grace  i got rid of all the graffiti   oh  my    oh  my god  carl   carl  oh  you should've seen it   they  uh     they were falling like bowling pins   i didn't see the knife   i don't know why i didn't see the knife   grace  get an ambulance   it's a nice night  no  no  no  stay here   just sit with me  no     i thought i could clean it up   i thought i could clean the whole neighborhood up myself   i thought that's why they sent me back here   but i guess i was wrong  huh   no  no  no  no  no  yeah   no  don't leave me  carl  please   no  no     no  i just want you   i just    i just want you   no  no     no   no     why take this guy  give him enough extra juice  to think he can make a difference  send him back     only to get himself killed   what's the point   i wish to hell i knew   reporter  grace morrissey   wife of slain bradley pa vigilante carl morrissey   revealed today that her late husband was one of  the controversial 4400   mrs  morrissey went on to state  that her husband was a true neighborhood hero   a sentiment echoed by many area residents   local law enforcement officials   as well as a spokesperson for  the national threat assessment command   refused to confirm or deny mrs  morrissey's statement   okay  i got the paperwork   okay  i need you to sign there     and there     and initial here    mm hmm   and sign there   so that's it   you got mr  ryland's signed approval   that simplifies things   i thought you were one of the doctors   yeah  i thought you were asleep     so you sure fooled me   how would you like to get out of here   now   right now   look out  look out  look out  thanks   where'kyle   surgery   dr  mayhew said he's got  some kind of fluid building up in his skull   and they're going to try and relieve somef the pressure   what do they mean  try  they said  the draining fluid might not be enough   that    that that more might build up   and if it does  then kyle  could suffer permanent brain damage within a week     danny  uncle tommy
