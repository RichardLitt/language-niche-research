well one of the funner things  that we do that we do here in pawnee  is the annl easter egg hunt   tom hides the eggs  and i have to say   he did an exceptional job this year   i've been searching for 25 minutes   and i haven't found a single egg   and i'm an adult   o yeah i forgot to do that   maybe tom's trying to make this year a challenge   and if so he's   he's succeeding   i don't think a single egg has been found yet   let's keep looking  we're gonna find one    bbs  proudly presents   bbs  sync  ytet          parks and recreation  s01 e02  i'm going to see my mom   she's a big mucky

if they vote you down then you're done   i don't care if there's gonna be a vote   i have a secret weapon   canvassing   nothing better than good old fashioned door to door campaigning   i'm not above using my expertise  to change hearts and minds if the cause is just   when i was in sixth grade   i was voted best dressed by 87 votes   and there were only  andy fell into that pit   i fell into that pit   how many more pawnee citizens are going to have to fall  into that pit before we turn it to park   zero  say it     zero     a hundred   i've got some sunscreen  for your beaks   tom you probably won't need any   uh and this is our canvassing guide   this is gonna be the script  that we use when we speak with people    if a person is a man turn to page two     if the person looks like a celebrity    jack nicholson   use this to help your pitch   you can't handle the pit   that's why we need to turn it into a park    o this is really thorough   ann and i are a team  you guys are a

of the whole thing   look i think this is a great idea   but i can't make any forum   i would have to get a babysitter   how old are your kids   four and two     could the four year old watch the two

to this   but ann please open the sealed envelope that's in your binder   this is a little something i learned from karl rove   if you want to guarantee the results of a survey   you design the question  to give you the answer that you want    wouldn't you rather have a park  than a storage facility for nuclear waste    that seems iffy   yeah don't worry about it  i made it all up   yeah that's   that's what i mean   wouldn't you agree   like most decent aricans   that it would be a good idea to turn  the abandoned lot on sullivan street  into a beautiful community park   oh actually no   i'm not really a fan of parks   very noisy  barbecue smell all the time   would you change your mind if i told you  that nine out of ten meth users said the same exacthing   what   how would you even know that   survey   we surveyed crystal meth users   we're actually having  a little town meeting tomorrow night if you wanted to     okay look i know it snds weird   but i just don't like living near parks   so do you have a flier or something   i'd be happy to take it     thank you    okay   you don't care about your kids if you don't support this park   excuse me   it's   what i mean

down there    hey vlad look at these rocks    let's pretend they're potatoes    nikolai   do you want to swim in the dirt    but not here okay   'cause we're a nation of dreamers   and it is my dream

here   oh no i can't do that   that's illegal   thank you so much for coming out tonight   this is our first ti  about the proposal to turn lot 48  on sullivan street in a community park   yeah   this is gonna be a train wreck   i want my daughter to be successful   which is why i always tell her    there's nothing wrong with being a wife and mother    now there are many people that i spoke to  who are passionately in support of this idea   none of them were able to make it tonight   unfortunately   but they totally exist   i did not make them up   oh i see a question  okay   no no   no  no questions right now     my name is kate speevack      i remember you   and i live in the neighborhood   and i am 100  against this park   i cannot believe the department is moving forward  with a project without a single environmental impact study   and if you guys agree with me   let's ke a stand   okay   um we are a little ahead of schedule  because we're holding this town hall meeting so soon   which i was warned about by mark brendanawicz   our city planner assigned to this project   uh so what would he say   here we are   leslie should i give them  some background info on the site   absolutely okay   mark brendanawicz knows the answer to every question   he's amazing and congratulations for hearing him speak   hi there  leslie might have oversold me a little bit   certainly did not  he's the man   he's capable of anything  okay   lot 48 is uh it's a rectangular lot   it's got excellent drainage   and it's on the corner of sullivan and collins   any questions   i have more of a comment than a question     go for it     it's for the guy in the cast   here we go  lawrence   yes yes yes   that is andy dwyer   he is a local resident and he tragicay ll in the pit   uh yeah i don't care about any of that   he's the guy that plays music all night in his garage   it's driving me nuts   lawrence lives with his grandma   which is pretty awesome   he takes care ofer i guess   but whatever  he's a douche bag   it's loud  it's abusive   and it's waking up my birds   you have birds now   yeah i have birds   i have nice pretty expensive birds   and you play that music and it wakes them up   look i don't work for the government okay   uh i do py rock   roll   guilty as charged   i'm in a band   it's called just the tip   and actually if anyone here plays bass we need a bassist   yes okay let's take a five minute break shall we   uh it is not going well at all   it's going very poorly   okay like you're crashing and burning   democracy's happening  people are talking   i mean at least they aren't apathetic right   you're right about that   they're deeply negative   you need to put a happy face on this   give me a few positive talking points   and whatever you do avd a vote   i'm oddly attracted to kate speevack   before we continue i'd love to just give you  a little history of wnee   the city of pawnee was incorporated in 1817  when a young man by the name of reverend luther howell  came from terre haute on an ox   he planted his flag in the ground and was met  soon aft by an angry tribe of wamapoke indians   who when seeing the whiteness of his skin   twisted him to death   flash forward to 1969   man walks on the moon   pawnee is lousy with hippies     my god she's filibustering her own meeting   mod squad   filibuster  boom   they can't touch you if you talk forever   i can't speak of the future   but i will   the future of pawnee will involve us flying around  in space taxis where we will communicate  on watches and blink our feelings to each other  rather than use words   and now i'd like to take  a magical journey through a little something  i like to call the phantom tollbooth  by norton juster   excuse me can't you read  that children's book on your own time   i have the floor    there once was a boy named milo   who didn't know what to do with himself   not just sometimes but always     okay all right you know what  this is a public forum   which means that we all get to tell you what we think   well you did already talk ma'am   and i would love to listen to someone else   someone i don't know   uh that girl over there  with the long brown hair and the yellow top   could you tell us how you feel about this park     go ahead     hi   uh i'm a youth in the community   and i think a new park is a great ia   and i fully support it   as would the rest of the youth in the community   hey i recognize her   that kid came to my door yesterday   oh my god okay they have planted people in this audience   unbelievable   u know what we all agree that this park is a baidea   we should just take a vote     right     okay we will take a vote before we do that   i want everyone up lined up behind that microphone   i want to hear from all of you one by one   that was brutal   a couple weeks ago i was yelling  at leslie at a public forum   god i hope i wasn't as obnoxious as those people   i wasn't right   at 5 00 in the morning every morning    beep beep beep   i don't want to hear that   now how long is this project gonna take   that's what i wanna know  that's what's important to me   because i need my sleep   thank you ma'am  thank you ma'am  that concludes our meeting   what abouthvote   we're out of time  it's 9 00   but we will have many public forums in the future   and we hope to see you all there   thank you so much for coming   it was tough   but you know that's pawnee  that's democracy   there are a lot of people here that want this park   you just gotta get past the negative people   but guess what   my subcommittee held its first town hall meeting tonight   god i loved it   i loved every minute of it   hey park lady     yeah     you suck   hear that   he called me park lady   you know normally   i don't agree with leslie about anything       missing
