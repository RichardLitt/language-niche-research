pregnant   hold her down   we're gonna have to strap her in   we gotta cut this baby out now  doctor   all right  all right   v p  60  pulse is thready   what the hell was that   we lost her heartbeat   go for the baby now  give me a scalpel   thank you all for convening at this late hour    at the wallace bromley medical center   while the details are still coming in   it appears to be another anomaly  whose mysteries and origins  remains the sole purpose of this committee   i called you together tonight to introduce you to my new team   who will now be responsible  for investigating all these events   hopefully  they will have more success than our last   walter bishop   dubbed by his contemporaries  as a successor to albert einstein   worked for the defense advanced research projects agency  from the late '70s     until he was committed  to the st  clair's mental institution  for manslaughter   he was never convicted of that crime   but in one of your own reports   you theorize that bishop's previous work  may itself be the root  of all these unexplained phenomon   given that he's been hugging a padded cell for 17 years   i think we can probably exclude him as a suspect   however  his knowledge makes him uniquely qualified  to assist our efforts  while he remains in the legal custody of his son peter   yes  peter bishop   whose history of questionable business practices  verge on fraud   yet you propose  giving him access to information that   if made public  would cause mass panic   there's nothing we could tell him  that he can't learn from his father  or deduce himself  with a 190 iq   what were you thinking when you recruited olivia dunham   an f b i  agent who had an illicit affair with her partner   a man who turned out to be a traitor   i was thinking that a woman who didn't hesitate  to follow the evidence and expose the man she loved  at the cost of great personal pain and embarrassment  must surely be worthy of our trust   i love you   who  who are you working for   hello   wake up  there's something you need to see   well  waking up's not gonna be a problem   but thank you for the gentle nudge   pick up the others and meet me in 30 minutes  at the bromley medical center   ah  good morning to you too   you're kiddin' me  right   your phone was off the hook   that's 'cause i didn't want to get woken up   you need to get your father   apparently there's something we need to see   and this something    it can't wait   okay   walter   hey  walter  come on  we're    walter   come on   tell me you're not in the close  what the hell are you doing here again   where i've been for the past 17 years  is a mental hospital   st  clair's   i'm the one that got you out of that place  remember   there was a patient there   carlos   he would sing  row  row  row your boat  every night   funny how difficult it is to sleep  without that song   that's nice   we gotta go  walter   hey  i got here  as fast as we could    peter bishop   i'm philip broyles  department of homeland security   thank for agreeing to work with us   just to be clear  i haven't agreed to anything   i'm just here as the babysitter   my father is the one you want   nice to meet you anyway   is he coming out   well  that's unclear   he's currently in the car  fiddling around with hiseat warmer   dr  bishop  hello   i appreciate you coming out tonight   i've never seen a feature like this before   it warms your ass  it's wonderful   have you tried it    a woman  pregnant to term   was found alone outside the hospital   she collapsed  suffering severe abdominal pain   she's a jane doe   prints and dna are being run now   should have her id'd by sundown   at 2 24  in less then two minutes after she was pronounced dead   ms  doe became a mother   did the baby survive   the newborn was convulsing   screaming in obvious pain   they placed it in a bassinet   were in the process of transferring it  to an intensive care when they realized  what was happening   it was growing    before their eyes   growing  you mean they could     see it getting larger   that's right   so where's the baby now   walter   it remained alive for nearly half an hour   this way   finally dying from natural causes   natural causes   i don't understand   what they realized is that the child wasn't just growing   it was aging   o okay  hold on a sec   it's 4 00 a m   so i'm a little foggy   but we're supposed to believe that grandpa here  was born four hours ago   were there any calls or tips   did the security cameras  see how the pregnant woman got here   did she drive herself or was she dropped off   we're checking those now   dr  bishop   any idea how something like this might happen  i think you're probably expecting a bit much   mr  broyles   celermitosis   disabling   reversing cell cycle inhibitors   activating them and turning cip kip  and inka 4a arfs into catalysts   ah  92  of caucasian newborns have blue eyes   yours were green   to understand what happened here   i'll need to run extensive tests   get these bodies to a lab   therefore  of course  i'll need a lab immediately   doctor  you have one   your old lab at harvard   we reopened it for you   do you not remember that   no   no  but that's fantastic news   all right  let's assume  for a second that bundle of joy here is for real   what are we doing here   a series of events has occurred   continues to occur   that has us and other agencies on alert   these events appear to be scientific in nature  and suggest a larger strategy  a coordinated effort   it's been referred to as  the pattern    mr  boyles  i consider myself a fairly intelligent guy   but i'm not following you here   inexplicable and frightening things are happening  and there's a connection somehow   thanks  that much  i understand   i got henning on the phone   the hospital got a call from a guest  at the scarlet red motel   checking to see if the pregnant woman was doing okay   was she staying there   yes  with a caucasian male     but there's no description of him  or the car he was driving   call the motel  make sure they don't touch anything   they shouldn't even go in   i already called  and you're good to go   the motel room's empty and locked   dr  bishop   i may need you to take samples from the motel room   i need you to come with me   walter   do you see what i'm doing here    hey   relax   i can't figure this out with a girl buzzing in my ear   i am trying to put these pieces together like a puzzle   how this happened  how he happened to her   i'm e on  olivia   i can do this   my limited stint at m i t  did teach me something   loraine daisy alcott   loraine daisy   that's just sad   one  r    i think i actually got something to sample in here   it's some kind of orange gel   i'm sorry about my father   he's always been a little     myopic   her things were left behind  but not his   checking the thread coun  yes   open the cabinet   why   there are gonna be sheets in there   okay  how'd you do that   hey  car's right here   olivia  what's going on   that's what he would do   he's go to motels ahead of time   replace the sheets with leak proof medical grade linen   so he wouldn't leave any blood evidence   who   i know who was in that room   the killer  i know who's profile   it was a case that john and i worked   serial murders in new jersey and new york   and we never caught him   look  you can't beat yourself up  'cause you didn't catch the bastard on your first try   i feel like i've been asleep for the last year   every case that john and i worked together   i have to go back and try and find whatever i missed   okay  then  tell me     how'd the killer do it   when i joined the fbi this is  one of the first cases  john and i investigated together   each time  he'd kill five young women  within a few days   he's pick them up  take them to motels     and then he'd give them a muscle paralyzer   they'd be wide awake  but unable to move   he's make an incision here  along their gums   and then he'd pull their mouths open up to their eyes   okay  that's enough  you can stop right there   he'd go through their nasal cavity  and remove a piece of their brain   and all of this connects to magic old man baby  and pregnant woman how   i don't know   but there's a connection somewhere   the muscle paralyzer he used was bright orange   so if that's our sample  then i'm telling you   this is our guy   which   means he's gonna kill again   i'm stacy   boston federal building  memorial services for agent scott  are being planned for late in the week   i know everybody's heard a lot of things  surrounding the circumstances of his death   but i just want to be clear   john scott was one of us   and we pay him the respect of considering him innocent  until the inquiry can establish the full facts of the matter   now  as far as any contacts   our official word right now is no comment   dismissed   what are you doing here   i left you a message   i know  i got it   you want to open up a 12 year old serial case   the brain surgeon   i don't think he retired   how long is broyles gonna have you on special assignment   what the hell are you working on  anyway   you knew  didn't you   about me and john   i like to think that i have some powers of deduction   i took advantage of our friendship   you kept quiet  even though you didn't approve   i hadn't seen you that happy in a long time   look  olivia  you have nothing to prove   yeah  i do   i have to live with the fact  that i didn't see him for who he really was   i have to live with the feeling  that whatever awful things he did   i should have stopped them   livy  you can    mostly i just wanna take a shower from the inside out   i'll get you the case files   stoughton  massachusetts   so i  i started working there  a couple weeks ago   it's a lot better than the one in providence   that place is a total dive   most guys bring me to a hotel   look at this place   those windows have a really great view of the bridge   i don't care about the bridge   what do you like   i like the bridge   go check it out   harvard university  hello   over here   what are you doing   i'm doing two things at once   i'm waiting for you  and i'm doing her a favor   you were supposed to be doing extensive testing   because a woman gave birth to an 80 year old man baby   remember that   done   test is complete   you underestimate me   which i suppose i deserve   but     wonderful news all around   dna results confirm my suspicions  that the woman was impregnated by a man  who's the result of experiments  identical to those conducted by me  in this very lab  around 30 years ago   so you know how this happened   no   no idea   the specifics elude me completely   so then what's this wonderful news   because i remembered something else   i remembered where i parked my car   really   you remember where you parked your car   pi to six digits   i can't fathom that it's still here   look at it   this is your car   of course it is   so what  you got cars stuffed with papers  all over town   not just cars   you have no idea where i've hidden things   friend of yours   oh   i certainly hope not   come on  boy  we need to get these file boxes  back to the lab   you may be able to reanimate  dead guinea pigs or   whatever   but i can bring anything mechanical  back from the dead   this is the last of them   that'll do   hello  i'm dr  walter bishop   yes  dr  bishop  we've met   i'm junior agent astrid farnsworth   third time's a charm   now  walter  we'd probably be a lot more help to you  if you told us what we were looking for   my research   sella turcica  diaphragma sellae    the dural folds of the pituitary fossa   in which the pituitary gland sits   situated in the sphenoid bone   did you just say pituitary gland   did i   well  that's how he killed   he'd perform surgery on his victims   remove the pituitary gland before he overdosed them  with anesthesia   look for anything with the pituitary in it   i'm sorry  i don't get it   i mean  what's the link to what happened at the hospital   advanced  rapid aging  like the disease called progeria   can be induced artificially  by manipulating the pituitary gland    p   pituitary   all the hormones in the human body that control growth   which is aging  really   are in the brain   and the pituitary gland is the boss   okay  pinto   penny  oh  ah  yes  penny   progeria  penny   case file by dr  penrose   yes  penrose  penrose   i remember him   a former colleague of mine   although he suffered from severe  pseudofolliculitis nuchae   razor burn  hell  no   we ran experiments on rapid growth   obviously  someone had made a breakthrough   and penrose could possibly lead us to that person   dr  claus penrose   he moved to the east coast two years ago   he's a professor at boston college   agent frances   charlie  it's me   dunham  what's up   i need a cross check of recent unsolved homicides   see if any bodies have turned up  with a missing pituitary gland   oh  you say the sweetest things   only to you  charlie   i'll get somebody on it    dr  penrose   yes   agent dunham  f b i   can we ask you a few questions   do you drink tea   the body you see there  was photographed only hours after being born   where is the mother   she died during childbirth   when she was admitted   she claimed she wasn't even pregnant   you worked with dr  bishop   manipulating growth hormones  at the end of the vietnam war   so   what can i do for you   in the years since   have you shared your research with anyone   i must tell you both  our work was    highly theoretical   but i was going to say that   more than anything  it was wrong   i resigned from the employ of the united states government  after only one year   when i refused to continue   i was harassed   threatened    with deportation   it   didn't feel like the america i   remembered  from when i was a boy   which is why     as sorry as i was to hear about  dr  bishop's incarceration   i believe it is the best thing  that could ever happen to humanity   no one in power should ever learn what he knows   uh   forgive me for  sounding uncooperative  agent dunham  but     my work to which you are referring  ended years ago   since then  i've done all i can  to forget it   what do you think   i think you know what i thi    well  he meant what he said   he's not telling us everything   dunham   sudbury police has a blonde female victim   surgical incision along her upper gum line   the central endocrine gland has been removed   this count   can you get the body brought to the lab   we'll do   astrid called  he said you have news   you're right   the pituitary gland has indeed been removed   and i may be able to posit a hypothesis as to why   years ago   when i worked with the defense department   we were tasked with a program  designed to cultivate soldiers   cultivate   quite literally   grow them   it was highly theoretical  of course   female eggs were to be fertilized in a lab  and given a cocktail of growth hormones   if perfected  a baby was born  and within three years  aged to the equivalent of a 21 year old male   a soldier in prime condition   you're telling me you developed a way  to grow soldiers  people   theoretically   the only problem was how to slow the aging process  once the subject had reached the desired physical age   once started  we couldn't turn the aging off   so you think now what   that the killer somehow continued your work   not exactly   but i believe that someone has made a breakthrough   that the killer is the product   the test tube human afflicted with rapid aging   to slow the process   he must extract the hormones  from the pituitary glands of his victims  to treat himself  to stay young   then the pregnant woman at the hospital    she was an accident   and the killer's condition was passed on to the baby   even condoms are not 100  effective   you two should be aware of this   that night  he was going to kill her   but first they fornicated   had intercourse  sex   okay  we got it   she became pregnant  um   but the pregnancy became horribly accelerated   so someone must have heard her scream   and he couldn't go through with his plan   he couldn't kill her   which is why he didn't kill this girl at a motel   because he was scared   and if his m o 's changed  then   we have nothing   we have to go back and start again from the beginning   no  this is okay  we're making progress    why don't you tell her that everything's going to be okay   i thought you had a way with women   christopher   the f b i  came to see me today   i know what happened   you got that woman pregnant   son  we have to be so careful   i know   how's the pain   getting worse   yes  well  we're almost there   you just need to get one more   and you'll be okay again   yes  yes  yes   something on your mind   please   the term  on your mind   vexes me with its depictive inaccuracy   aw  stop   would you just talk like a person    what are you thinking   jules verne    yes   although i was referring to his lesser known masterwork   the kip brothers   in which he posited that the last image seen in life   right at the moment of death   is permanently imprinted on the retina of the eye   also a work of fiction   which is a small but critical distinction   when was it you lost your imagination  son   all right  do you want to play   let's play   the only way that we can see what she saw   even in theory   is if we could recover the electric impulses  that were traveling along her optic nerve   which we can't   ah  we're in luck   this woman was given a muscle relaxant   the drug would have frozen her neural pathways  at the moment of death  and the last images she saw with it   okay  assuming we're actually having this conversation   we would still need a     well  i don't know   we still need something that could translate what she saw    something that could translate  from her eyes to a monitor   a tv screen   i'm sorry about the lab   i don't usually     what   lose control   to tell you the truth  it was kind of a relief   you've been so together with everything that's going on   i was starting to develop an inferiority complex   knowing that walter's work  is responsible for all those murders     i just want you to know that you're not alone here   listen     i can't believe that i'm about to propose this   but i  i think     we've actually figured out a way  to track down that psycho   how   well  we need a piece of equipment   it's  uh  laser optic hardware   very crazy and very  very hard to find   but as it turns out  only one company  has the patent   please  have a seat   ms  sharp will be right with you   i have reservations  about asking massive dynamic for a favor   the corporate mind always looks for quid pro quo   can i ask you a question   of course   before he died  agent scott suggested  that this was more than a coincidence  that you recruited me for this assignment   agent dunham     do you mind if i ask you a personal question  about you and agent scott   the very last time you were   intimate     were you safe   you weren't  were you   agent dunham   ms  sharp will see you now   i hope the ride was comfortable   i'm not a big fan of airplanes myself   despite the obvious intellectual understanding of their safety   my hands still get sweaty on takeoff   thank you again for your cooperation  we're very    no need to thank me   you know  i've been thinking of you   meaning to thank you for being a woman of your word  and keeping massive dynamic out of the press   i also wanted to say     you have my sincere condolences  on the loss of agent scott   what do you know about agent scott   i know that he was your partner   i've lost people close to me   i know how hard that can be   not to mention the rumor about what he was involved with   and  of course  the joy of being a female  in a traditionally male line of work   no doubt some of your male colleagues  are assuming that you two were intimate   the electronic pulse camera   travel safely  agent dunham   are we ready   dear  the lights   goggles  all of you   do not look directly into the light   is this really gonna work   faith   never a bad thing to have   this is taking too long   if he's already picked up another    impatient   you always were   as if you ever knew me well enough  to make a statement like that   huh  you're a smart boy   but there is much you don't know   did you see that   what was that   wait  wait  what was that   can you focus   it's not a slide projector   wait   astrid  can you flip it over   that's a bridge   i know that bridge   i used to live in denton   that's  um  that's sargent bridge   that's in stoughton   what's in stoughton   the warehouse district   this would be one of the last images she saw   in theory  yes   where would she have to have been  to see that angle of the bridge   pull up n r o  online  image mapping database   okay  match the angles   wait  stop   that's it   pull out to aerial view and triangulate   it looks like she's in this warehouse district   the 1600 block of bond street   i want satellite images of that area  for the last 24 hours   okay   street sweeper on the access road  at 8 05 p m   i got nothing between 6 00 and 7 45 p m   what are we looking for  exactly   she died in one of these buildings   i've got a gray sedan parked outside unit 17  at 8 05 a m   i've got the same vehicle eight hours later   that's the estimated time of death of our last victim   if you get anything more specific  call me   you got it   i'm coming with you   it worked  peter  see that   it worked   so lessing   borrow    belmont   hold on  did you say borrow   did we pass borrow already   there   stay there   that's just not gonna happen   f b i   hands in the air   i said put your hands up   she's alive   is there anyone else here   you have your phone   yeah   dial 1 7 2 2 4   ask for charlie francis   tell him we need field assist   tell him to ping the g p s  for the location   safety's on the right  do not let him move   freeze   hey  hey  back off   hello   it's peter   just making popcorn   walter  i'm with a woman in her mid 20s   she is going into cardiac arrest  due to an overdose of anesthesia   her heart just stopped   do you have any cocaine   cocaine  no  i don't have any cocaine   oh  then too bad   you'll have to shock her heart   yeah  i know that   unfortunately  i don't have a defibrillator   hey  you still there   what is the optimum voltage for cardiac resuscitation   try 200 volts   all right  here it goes   it's not working   well  you'll have to crank it  won't you   hey  it worked   good work  son  good work   you're gonna be okay   he  he should have let me die     a long time ago   i'm not   i     i was an experiment   someone     someone paid him   the man i called my father   that was his mistake   but he was blinded     because he loved me   he loved me   he      thank you again for your help  that's what i'm here for   i hope it served you well   i'd ask you what you wanted the camera for   but i respect your confidentiality   well  we're grateful for your help   seems you're settling well into your new position   excuse me   i don't think a woman of your talents  should be in public service   oh   and where should i be   here  at massive dynamic   you're offering me a job   philip broyles is a good man   and his record speaks for itself   well  i'm sure you got into law enforcement  because you wanted to make a difference   so consider this   massive dynamic is one of the ten largest  economic entities in the world   our weapons technologies  shape the defense department's strategies   our investments sway the markets  and make or break presidential elections   overseas  we have responsibilities  traditionally sacred to the state   the right to direct private armies   to manage global affairs into stable equilibrium   you're serious   yes  i am   not to mention  i believe a position here  would speed your effort to find answers   you're referring to the pattern   among other things   penrose took a hit   forensics tracked a two mile spatter trail  leading from the warehouse out to route one   local pd's on the lookout   and i've ordered checkpoints along the intersta   but nothing so far  he's still out there   listen     every aspect of these investigations  is strictly classified   all of it   you understand that   of course   certain private individuals have been granted clearance  regarding the pattern   including nina sharp   but that clearance is limited   i understand   sure  but  uh     i'm not clear on what you're getting at   when you were with her  did she share anything with you   did she mention the pattern   did she comment or ask you anything  about the details of your investigation   yeah  she did   she said you were a good man   and that was it   she offered me a job   and what did you say to that   i told her you were gonna give me a raise    i acknowledge that by signing this document    i waive my constitutional right  against unreasonable search and seizure    i'm not signing this   i  however  will   well  of course you will  what have you got to lose   you're already committed to a mental institution   you have to sign it too   i'm not signing my rights away to the federal government   i already got enough trouble in my life   about my former colleague and his son   it's one of the inherent pitfalls of being a scientist   trying to maintain that distinction     between god's domain and our own   sometimes  i forget myself   but then  you already know that   what do you mean   if you've read my file   then you know the truth about peter's medical history   i've been meaning to ask you to    walter     there was no mention of any medical history   just his birthday   i was going to ask you  to keep it between just the two of us  but  uh     i suppose  then  there's no need   zero   one  two   three   eight   hey  walter     you're awake  peter   me too   i was trying to lull myself to sleep   yeah  i'm     i'm aware of that   i can hear you   you think you could do that in your head   wasn't i   i thought i was   sorry   that's okay   just   try and keep it down  all right   son   is that you   yes  walter  it's me   just   stop talking  and close your eyes  okay
