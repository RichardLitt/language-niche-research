concerns regarding  the department's long time policies   joe  do the police have any leads at this time   we're at a loss  we really don't know what else to do   been a tough few weeks  basically run out of ideas   hopefully the police will be able to crack this one for us   closing the books on the visions break ins could be just  the olive branch needed to set things in the right direction   what are you doing   i'm calling the police   any particular reason   i think i just closed a case     you didn't tell me you're a cop    oh  no  no  no   definitely not a cop   does that disappoint you   i just thought you might have handcuffs   oh  i have handcuffs  hello   santa barbara police department   uh  it's the store manager  he did it     pardon me    uh  the stereo robberies   at the visions chain store   he's on channel 8 news right now   uh  his hands  nervous tic    dead giveaway   and he won't look at the reporter in the eyes   my name   my name is shawn    spencer     and is there anything else today    no  that's gonna do it   actually  the tags on the news van have expired   but that's completely unrelated    hello  officer   but you gotta go   it was awesome  well

they spelled  bloodthirsty  wrong on mine   can you believe it   i cannot believe you didn't test that out first   one  two  three     what'd you do  bust up your ex wife's car     her new boyfriend's

get my money     money    yeah  the reward   you guys arrested the store manager  am i right   why don't you let us ask the questions for awhile   okay   so which questions might those be   ooh  i don't know   like where were you the night of the last robbery   i was robbing a stereo shop   i wasn't   i don't know  i guess i was doing the same  thing you were doing  not solving crime     you're not helping your case here    my case   wait  wait  wait  i'm actually a suspect     oh  you're our lead suspect    i gave you the guy   he had a partner   i have to find that guy i'm confused  when do you start chipping in   see  your information was good   so good  it could only have come from the inside   inside of what   look  i've called in dozens of tips  okay     just check it out    i did   i checked out a whole lot of stuff   like  oh  you're currently unemployed   you've never held a job for more than six months   and you have a criminal record     i was 18    oh  18   well  that makes it okay  let me just scratch this out     i borrowed a car    you stole a car   to impress a girl   look  forgive us  mr  spencer  if this seems far fetched   would it help at all if i told you that she  had a bit of a reputation and i was 0 for     high school   okay  fine  there were extenuating circumstances   the arresting officer was my father  he was trying to teach me a lesson   did you learn it   i learned i hated my father  so sure   pardon me if i'm just a little skeptical   believable as it is that you solved all these crimes     i'm sorry  what was it   watching the local channel 8 news reports   i confess  that's not true   sometimes i watch channel 5  i prefer channel 8   the weather girl  adorable   so you're telling us that you can read guilt off of tv interviews   can't you   don't you try and trivialize police work   i think you're doing a bang up job of that all by yourself   you can't keep me here  guys  i know my rights   good   then you know you have the right to remain silent   you have the right to an attorney   if you cannot afford one  one will be appointed to you   wait  wait  wait  you're serious   a few hours in a holding cell might jog your memory   just give us a reason  mr  spencer   that's all we need  how did you get this information   no  it is too late for that  officer allen  book him   book him   oh  come on  cuffs  what  for the walk back to the lobby   or you could give us a plausible explanation   i     okay  okay   fine  you win   i got the information because     i am a psychic     get him out of here    oh  boy   your grandma would be so proud     you spoke to her    i did   she's    safe  comfortable   she wants you to stop spending all your money on those charlatans     the palm readers    the palm readers   okay  just to be clear  um   you're claiming to be a psychic  mr  spencer   how else would i know that you two are sleeping together   one  two  three     one       when's the wedding    may 3rd   wait

karen vick  interim police chief   i know     heard about what you did in there    oh  you're welcome   that wasn't the phrase i was going to use   i was going to say improbable   possible  yet unlikely   look  it's hard to explain   i'm gifted  i was born that way   i knew your father  he was a good cop     you're nothing like him    i take that as a compliment  ma'am   don't ever call me  ma'am      am i still free to go    not exactly   you familiar with the mccallum family   mccallum  yeah  they own half the hill   well  there's been a kidnapping   oh  come on  i had nothing to do with that   would you like to   the feds are itching to jump in on this case   and i need to make some progress   what i need is a miracle  or a facsimile of one   i see  i see  well  i make  1  200 a day     it's a try out    that's what i meant to say   this is pro bono  something for you   and if this psychic thing is a scam     we will prosecute   you know hindering a police investigation is a criminal offense   sounds good   we're on the same team now  kidnappers beware   i have a job for you   i already have a job     they're paying you to play video games   how do you do that   come on  left hand space bar  right hand arrow keys   gus  you should ask me a challenging  question every once in awhile just for kicks   i can't go anywhere  i'm behind on my route   i got new samples of ceromoxicyllan   oh  man  i'm sorry   i didn't realize the new butt cream had come in   so you're not interested in hearing about doing  the thing we've been dreaming of doing since we were eight   i've got us the last job we will ever need   shawn  you've had 57 jobs since we left high school   yes  i have  and they were all fun   but this one takes the cake   oh  yeah  better than your acupuncture clinic   i didn't realize experience was necessary   what about the summer you spent driving the wiener mobile   i did that for the hot dogs   look  gus  all those jobs i took because i wanted the experience   but then i mastered it and i moved on   but this job has a little bit of everything     come with me    uh  no   i'm never doing anything blindly with you again   i learned that at the mexican border twice   okay  this is hard to explain  but i'm going to give it a shot   you and i     are opening our own private detective agency   oh  see   no explanation necessary   let me get my coat     but you're not getting your coat    uh  no  no  shawn  i'm not   all right  you want to sweat the details   fine   the cops think i'm a psychic   and now we are investigating a kidnapping     you're serious    yes  i am serious   six days ago  camden mccallum jr   sole male heir to mccallum textiles   was seen being forced into his range rover at the municipal dog park   no one's seen him or the dog since     they took the dog    you see what i mean   i need you   i need you to    to write stuff down   cause you know how i zone out when other people talk     just for today    just today   oh  and you know what  you should bring your sample case  because some of those forensics guys     whoa  whoa  whoa   there's going to be forensics guys there   all right  pay attention   mccallum ran his father's  cigarette boat into the morro bay aquarium   that was right after he got caught with  that hockey player's wife   yeah  i remember that   guy hadn't been out of the papers in five years   since that day  nothing   not a single news story  not so much as a dented motorcycle   okay   what do you think   i think camden mccallum is too good at what  he does to stop  not cold turkey anyway   beautiful women  fast cars  doesn't add up   something happened   how should we introduce ourselves   don't say  psychic    they'll shut you off   say something vague  like  alternative tactics division     how about the bureau of magic and spell casting   where are you going     you're rooting through the trash    just for a second   you are without doubt the worst detective i've ever seen   gus  everything you need is right in front of you   you just have to pay attention   oh  yeah   look at this   berenson's brand   that is the highest quality dog food on the market   perfect  they pamper their pets  the case is almost solved   this stuff is really expensive   no additives  no preservatives   why would you possibly open three bags  simultaneously when you only have one dog   they're rich  they waste money     oh  my god    what   this cd case is totally nice   why would someone throw this out  here  put this in the car   inside now   is it entirely too early for me to have a theory   can you at least wait until we see some evidence   i suppose i could if it would make you happier   whoa   just act natural     they know    how could they know     they know    we haven't said anything yet     they know  i can feel it    oh  you're a psychic now too   you're not a psychic   gus  let's just be clear on one thing   the only way they can absolutely prove  that i am not a psychic is if i tell them   and i can guarantee you   that is the one thing i will never do   ooh  ooh ooh  check this out   you got a lead   no  but look at this girl   she must be the sister  god  she's incredible   kind of have a few other things going on right now  shawn   oh  gus  look   look how she went from this awkward stage  with this really unfortunate perm to this beautiful  amazing girl   she's a late bloomer  but what does    what does  that mean  that means depth of character   gus  she kayaks   what  are you lamaze breathing   it helps  i cover a few birthing centers   let me know when the contractions are two minutes apart   she reads vonnegut   she's an aviatrix   gus  i bet this girl is spectacular   really now   i'm katarina mccallum   i'm    thoroughly embarrassed   i'll bet you are   i'm sorry  i'm shawn spencer   the chief called me in   everything's gonna be okay   thank you for saying that   i have the same feeling  what makes you think so   i'm a psychic   they called in a psychic   i have very unique and special abilities   well  shawn spencer   if you need to ask any questions     just one   do you currently have a boyfriend     is that pertinent    it very well could be   uh  well  yes   i'm sort of seeing someone  nothing serious though   nothing too serious   that's good  that's very good   i think that's it for now  i'll be in touch   how do you luck into these women all the time   gus  please   i am a professional gathering information   what are we looking for   pictures of that katarina girl   preferably at the beach  maybe on her way to yoga   or at a halloween party dressed as a cat     what are those for    it's for anxiety   is it ethical to sample your own samples   mr  spencer  the sketch artist is here for you     the sketch artist    the chief insisted     interim chief    yeah  you call her that   i'll be right back   oh  yeah  that's nice   yeah  with the shading  the shading's nice   uh  here's a question   do you think you could have him looking further  to the left    his eye line further to the left     shawn    yeah     can i talk to you for a second    yeah  yeah   so just more to the left  and i think we're there     what's up    what are you doing   just    just work with me   tell them your blocked or something   i'm gonna have to use that later   uh  how we looking over there   oh  that's great  now look how good that is   see how he's looking off to the left like he's seeing something   as far as the hair goes  can we get the bangs wispier  like he's trying to compensate for like maybe  he's thinning in the back and sort of got a swoop   oh  my gosh  it's bill  oh  it's bill   oh  honey  come here quick  bill's the kidnapper   that's the exact cap i gave him   okay  everybody  stop   no  no  i'm sorry   bill is not the kidnapper  not the kidnapper   bill is just a horrible human being   who is  bill   i'm getting  uh  multiple women   is he a bigamist  pimp   does he sell children on the black market   mr  mccallum  i'm shawn spencer  the psychic   well  thank you for coming  if there's anything i can do     i can't imagine how difficult this must be for you  sir   nothing can prepare you for something  like this knowing you can't do anything   call me any time with any questions   uh  actually  i do have one question  sir   how did he feel about the dog   well  he loved that damn thing  didn't do anything without it   yeah  that'll do it  thank you  sir   does he like his dog  that's how you investigate   i think we're making progress   since you've been here   all you've done is dig through the trash   hit on the victim's sister  and falsely accuse her boyfriend   gus  he is not her boyfriend   she made a point to say they're free to see other people   whatever you say  shawn  have a blast  i quit   you can't quit  we just got started   watch me   gus  you're gonna miss everything   it's gonna be fun   gus  get back here   fine   i'll solve this case by myself   gus   i hate to imagine what the rest of your plan was   how did you get in   far less effective on a second floor landing   what do you want  shawn     can i ask you something about the case  please   no     i was right    i'm done  shawn   i don't want to commit felonies and perjury and pretend to be     you're dying to know who kidnapped him   i know you are   no  no  i'm not   because i don't believe that you can solve a crime  the cops can't by simply walking through a house     fine    fine   all right  whatever   who kidnapped him   nobody   nobody  excellent   call the chief at home  tell her the crime is solved   because apparently  we just imagined the whole thing   gus  nobody kidnapped him because he did it himself   come on  see for yourself   okay  here's the thing   camden didn't offer to clean up his act voluntarily   oh  no  daddy threatened to cut him off permanently     this was about 18 months ago    18 months   but wait  there's more  he had help   who   this guy on the end  malcolm orso   only member of this crew that  didn't go on to fame or fortune or rehab     the cops must've talked to him    nope   malcolm hasn't been seen with camden for quite some time   to be exact       18 months    almost to the day   gus  he has been planning this thing for over a year     shawn  this is good    yeah     where did you get this    katarina mccallum's room   you didn't go in her room   gus  i needed a ride  she hadn't eaten yet   one thing led to another  and we ended up sharing a milk shake   whoa  wait a second  wait a second     you're dating her    no  i'm not  dating    yes  you are   it's not exclusive   what  gus  come on   put some clothes on  this is gonna be fun   let's go  i'm driving  where are your keys   never mind  i got 'em   ooh  should i slice this up for the road     well  we're off to a banner start    just let me do the talking     morning  gentlemen    hello  officer   what's this   whoops   it's my dad's old police business card   must've stuck in back there   guess i've been carrying that in my wallet for ages   can never be too careful coming from a family of cops     henry spencer's your dad    yes  yes  he is   well  how's old henry doing   oh  you know henry  he's great   retired  living in miami   i saw henry three weeks ago at the home depot   yeah  yeah  that    that sounds about right   he popped into down for a few days  grabbed some supplies   some wood   said he'd been back for over a year   and now he's back running around  doing his thing henry style   tell your dad that kingfisher says hello   will do  thank you  officer   your dad's back at the house   apparently   dude  i'm so excited   this is my first use of spy technology   yeah  it would seem much cooler if it didn't  have sports illustrated pasted on the side    are you going to tell me why we're here   this is the orso family cabin where young malcolm  and young camden spent all their summers growing up   wouldn't the police have checked this out   malcolm is so far out on the periphery of camden's life   he's not on the witness list  he's not on anybody's list   this is a great plan   camden mccallum deserves to be commended     maybe you should date him too    maybe i will   let me see   let's see here     oh no way    what   it's camden's dog   get    dude  dude   oh  my gosh  i can't believe we did this   this is unbelievable   what   okay  okay  okay  wait  okay  wait   let's call the cops  no  no  no  let's call the chief   that's what we're gonna do  call the chief  yeah   no  no  no  no  no  no  gus  gus     we don't call anyone    what   then later at headquarters   i suddenly and miraculously have a vision     a vision    a vision of stuff we saw   like  uh  like the road sign with the two bullet holes   like the red kayak  the yellow kayak   and the highway with numbers  oh  i'm seeing     what am i seeing     we're on highway 138    exactly   in the spirit world   things get jumbled and out of sequence   but my premonition becomes clear when  we all jump in the squad car together   by the way  let me sit next to that junior detective     shawn  please    for the last  we lead them here   then finally  we both put on our surprise faces  as i guide them to the cabin for the  first time     this is mine   what do you got   gus  that's horrible  it doesn't convey surprise at all   gus   all right  let me do the talking   is there even an option   i want    i want a lot of witnesses for my miraculous vision   yeah  yeah  there they go   detectives   detectives  detectives   we have a breakthrough  it is very important   i also have something important  i call it lunch  make an appointment     but this is      you don't have my interest   you don't have my ear  find a beat cop  tell your story   maybe i'll read the report  good day  gentlemen  after you   detective   don't eat the chicken   don't eat the chicken     he's got your number    he's got nothing   i'll have the chicken enchilada  extra chicken   okay   i'll have the cheese quesadilla   coward   you're mad because he pegged us as a couple   he was tipped off  did you tell anyone   why would i tell anyone   let everyone think i'm working my way up the ladder the hard way   you're barely separated   it's been five months   so the plan was to annoy them into believing you   billy camp's working the grill   so   billy camp has the worst hay fever i've ever seen   feel this wind   feel it   i will be right back   here we go  act natural   okay  what is it   oh  my   this is great  now what   does anyone have any binoculars   no  no  you see  we don't carry binoculars   ooh  never mind  i found some here in my pocket   there it is   just like i saw it   want to tell me what i'm looking for  please   uh  i'm    i'm not sure exactly   i see a bone   what  a human bone   no  no   rawhide  and a ball   holy crap   call for backup   what   what do you see  detective   i can't believe they won't let us in  this is lame   and you were so polite when you asked  the s w a t  team to issue you the luger   just make sure you act in awe of me  when they come to say i was completely right   oh  and maybe a little afraid like my  powers could possibly be used for evil   oh  watch out  watch out   for what  it's tongue   that thing could be vicious   yeah  diabolical with its calculated decoy tail wagging   there's blood on its whiskers   that's not blood  that's snausages     are you sure    yes  i'm sure   either that or he just mauled a mountain lion   come on  gus   mr  spencer  follow me   now if there's any press  make sure you mention our agency     we don't have an agency    yes  we do   i applied for a dba on line   which reminds me  we're going to need a name   mind masters  already taken   make sure you tell them that we do private cases   cause i bet the department's only  going to be good for one or two months   you tell them    i can't   i'm secretive  mysterious  enigmatic     delusional    remember  act surprised   wow  it is just like i saw before   pardon me   ladies  gentlemen   to call on you again  mr  spencer   and even though this case  didn't end up exactly the way we hoped   i thank you for your services   you were invaluable   thank you   you're making a huge mistake  this case isn't closed   pardon me   murder  suicide come on   you're buying that   i'm not buying anything   those are the facts   i'll buy it   i understand   i do   you'd like to shut the book on  this as quickly as possible  it's fine   they had a falling out   before they got the ransom money   why  what did they have to fight about before they got the cash   might i remind you  mr  spencer  you are not a detective   i just need to speak to the witnesses again   the mccallum family has been through enough   and this conversation is over   thank you   uh  we parked in a parking structure   do you validate   would it make any difference if i  told you camden mccallum jr  spoke to me     from beyond the grave   shut the door on your way out   damn it   what are you doing   that was the chief of police   interim chief   and have you considered that camden mccallum  may have been alive the first time we went to that cabin   no  well  i have   i need to talk to that guy   whoa  whoa  no   come on  gus  just for a second   the man is practically almost my father in law   make no mistake  shawn  i will kill you   okay  i appreciate the fact that you think you can beat me up   but i think our last scuffle proves otherwise   are you talking about the cinnamon festival   yes  you do remember   okay  first of all  i was six   and i had a cast   which many would construe as a clear advantage   it's like having a weapon attached to your arm   oh  great  now the chief is staring right at us   mr  mccallum   chief wants them left alone   well  we all want to be left alone   yeah  some more than others   what's with his wrist   you don't give up  do you   i do give up  all the time   but not until the moment is right   now come on  i know you don't think this adds up either   okay  the rumor is he tried to off himself   off himself   the war hero   the man who's seen everything   no  that's not it   that's definitely not it   you know everything  don't you   yeah  it's scary  isn't it   something is going on  and i'm gonna find out what it is   no  you're not going anywhere near that man   in fact  i'm going to make certain you never hear from the department again   i'm getting strong vibrations that you might be wrong   i'm on to you   you've got a source somewhere and i'm going to find it   you think this is some sort of game   i'm not going to let you just waltz  around here like some kid in a candy store   let me be honest with you  detective   i used to work in a candy store and it's nothing like this   you're in over your head  mystic   hi  dad   shawn   you didn't tell me you moved back   you didn't tell me you moved away   that was different  was it   yeah  i was busy trying to help my mom through her divorce   well  it's nice to see you  too  son   can i come in   no   i was on my way out to lunch   you can come with me if you don't bring this thing   when i was in the department  there  were two things i hated in this world   private investigators and psychics   congratulations  kid   you just hit the disappointment exacta   thank you  thank you very much   it sort of happened by accident   what are you gonna do when you get caught   move out of town   i'm not going to get caught   shawn  this is just like everything else   three months from now  you're going to be on a bus going to minneapolis  cause you found your calling as a weather man   it's not like that this time   have you been listening to me   i finally figured out a way to use my special gift   you should be thrilled   you're the one that made me this way   i'm good at this   oh  oh  oh  i see   you're so good at it   what are you doing knocking at my door   you think i came to you for help   okay   there was no ransom drop   i'm not gonna be a part of this   come on  would you just hear me out   okay  no ransom drop   so what  big deal   so six days  nothing not even a demand   it happens all the time   it's not unprecedented  they try to create panic in the family   yeah  i know  i know  but not this guy   this guy wanted it done quickly  i know that   well  then you missed something   you've been driving your motorcycle all across the country   working your bungee cord jumping expeditions   you're soft  hey  pal  it happens   i'm not soft  i'm sharper than i've ever been   close your eyes   no way  i'm not seven   close your eyes  any longer  i'll think you're cheating   how many hats are in the room   all right  fine   just in case you're trying to pull a fast one   i'm not counting the one in your pocket   nylon fishing hat on the loner in the corner   foam cap on the kid who's too young to know  they were lame the first time they came out   both truckers   one a concrete company i've never heard of   the other advertising free moustache rides   i'm fairly certain no one's taken him up on that offer   norwegian girl  ponytail pulled out the back   unfortunately  she's married   and our friendly bartender wearing the official hat of the restaurant   six hats   and   that's it   sorry  pal  there are seven hats   i can't help you  you missed something   i didn't miss anything   there are seven hats  shawn   were   before i closed my eyes   cowboy hat walked out while i was ridiculing moustache rides   come on   i heard her boots   all right  close enough   close enough  no   i nailed that   yeah  but you changed the rules   but  hey  if it makes you happy   change the rules   i did not change the rules   what i did was nail it and you know it   shawn  you want my advice   go out  get yourself a real job  grow up   in the meantime   you might want to ask yourself  who you're trusting in this case that maybe you shouldn't   cause  obviously  you're overlooking somebody   thanks for lunch   why are we at the mccallum offices   what is the magnification on these things    okay  we need to stop at wal mart on the way home   why don't you just take your big  loud motorcycle   ooh  here we go  here we go   oh  hell no   you got me out of work so you could stalk a girl   damn it  what is he doing here   i can't believe this   what's up with his hair   it's horrible   i knew i should've had him picked up for questioning   that is not the way a grown man kisses a grown woman   we're we're fine   why does she look so nervous   oh  no   is it just me or does that bag look  like it's filled with stacks of ransom money   give me that   oh  my god   katarina   it was her   you're dating a murderer   not exclusively   you see  i knew there was a reason she went for you so easily   she wasn't lying  gus   i know when people are lying   oh yeah   apparently not   you just got played   should we call the cops   too late for that   you could pretend you had a vision of a girl totally manipulating you   would you stop   what should we do   there's only one thing to do   oh  you have got to be kidding me   shawn  hey   what are you doing  helping   you're supposed to stay at the car  you didn't tell me   well  come on   gus  you locked the car   it's a bad neighborhood   what in the world's going on  shawn   i know what's in the bag   you do   you're good  very good   i didn't consider who'd be the sole heir to the mccallum fortune  if camden was out of the picture   okay  okay  wh     you think i want my family's money   you don't need it  do you  now that you've got    this money   we've got to get better binoculars   katarina     go buy the bag   what  you want a souvenir of your ineptitude   i need to get a better look inside the bag   i'm not going in there   that guy wants to kill us   gus  this guy works in a thrift store   okay  he's a big  furry hearted  good samaritan   come on   i'll be right here   go ahead   what the hell do you want   can i have the bag   you serious   just the bag   not the clothes   i'll pay you for it   you've got some nerve coming in here   i can't believe this  neither can i   i've gone to jail for less than you   jail's no fun  i'll tell you that much   oh  you've been   once  in monopoly   okay  hold on  hold on   who's that   move  move  move  move   hey  get back here   you  hey   go  go  go   i can't believe you sold me out like that   you didn't tell me i was a decoy   of course you're the decoy   seems pretty clean   what  they didn't happen to leave a ransom note inside   give me some money  get your own money   gus  i'll give it back   seriously  this is all you carry   okay   so we've got five stacks going across   you figure four going long ways   ten stacks in each pile based on the wear and the indentation     depending on the denomination   uh  this could easily be  5 million   you're kidding  give or take   you got that from a groove on the side   come on  gus  any small child could've figured that out   so somebody at that house did pay a ransom   mm hmm  or tried too   who  i don't know   we're going to need more than my psychic powers to figure this out   here to scope out the new meter maids   nope  i am here to see you   not interested   i know you  you have someone special   he's married and or separated   is there a point to this  mr  spencer   of course  you and i have something in common   what's that   we both know this case is nowhere near closed   unfortunately  gut feelings aren't admissible in a california court   how about motive   what do you have  nothing  yet   but i've seen something   seen or seen   well  what do you think   okay  what do you need   everything you have on malcolm orso   he was camden's accomplice   i'll get fired   will you really because it seems like a gray area to me   that's the problem with you  mr  spencer   you live your entire life in a gray area   that's not true   though i generally vacation in gray areas   we can't talk here   hold up   it says orso was seen in the town near the cabin   yeah  twice   early in the week by a store owner   what was he buying   nothing  the old man just saw him on the street   same old man sees him two times   mm hmm  yeah   orso had one of those modified mufflers on his nova   you could hear him a block away   you'll need a new target sheet   oh  oh  no  no  no   this is  uh  this is fine   they're so much lighter when they're filled with water   you missed   did i really   look at that   it's a perfect match   damn   i'm telling you   there's no way katarina's going to talk to you   yeah  well  i sort of lied about that part   we're not here to see katarina   who we were to see   this is highly inappropriate  mr  spencer   the investigation is over   what if they got the wrong man   and who would the right man be   you   mr  mccallum  i didn't have anything to do with this   i killed my own son   if it makes you feel any better  i don't think you meant to   you're not a detective   you're not even a cop   you're right   i'm a psychic   and i saw the whole thing   i see a ransom drop   you're doing everything they ask   you didn't call the police   you're thinking of nothing but the security of your son   after all  what's  5 million to you   you're driving away   i can see it   something strange happens   you recognize the car   you pass it on the hill   it's malcolm orso's   you've seen it hundreds of times at your house ever since high school   maybe it confirms a suspicion that you already have   you know where they are   you know the cabin   he's making coffee   you didn't mean to kill him  did you   no  just knock him around a little bit  teach him a lesson   but he falls to the floor  he slams his head on the oak table   he's dead   you know he's dead   orso walks in  finds you   he's got a half ass pistol  but he's no criminal   you know there's only one way to cover your tracks   you take care of him too   make it look like a suicide   then you come home  inform the police  and you wait   you wait for a ransom call that will never come   police eat it up   it's easy to look shaken after all you've done   you might even be willing to take your own life   you have an overactive imagination   perhaps a side effect of your gift   shawn  we need to go  not yet   i'm about to throw up on a turkish carpet   no  you're not  it's in my esophagus   the second door on the left  turn on the fan and flush   i will not have this incident rehashed over and over again   i know what your relationship was with your son   oh  really   i have a father that i disappoint all the time   i'm sure you do   i know how you feel   this was it   this was the straw that broke the camel's back  wasn't it   to think 18 months ago  he sat across from you   looked you right in the eye and  said   dad  i'm going to clean up my act this time   this time  i am going to change  i swear     to know that he duped you and you fell for it all over again  must've sent you into a state that even you can't believe   mr  spencer  i've been assured but the lieutenant governor  that this case will not cast a pall over my family   but i can assure you   it's gonna cast one over yours   my very first case  i'm already being threatened   shawn  let's go   not quite finished   we're going now   listen to your friend   i'll be back  no  you won't   okay  we're going   we're clearly going   all right   dude  what are you doing we had him on the ropes   it wasn't the right tack   oh  you're the expert now  consumine   what  consumine   it's for dog bites  i have some samples   gus  what are you saying to me   i'm saying there was a bottle of it in  the medicine cabinet prescribed wednesday   you wonder why he had on that  long sleeve shirt in the heat that first day   oh  my gosh  that dog did have blood on his teeth   i told you it wasn't snausages   we're never getting back in there   i know   just give me a second   what are you doing  i'm thinking   you look ridiculous   now what are you doing  i'm calling the cops   for what  you heard the guy in there   they're never going to come   i'm not calling the cops on him   i'm calling the cops on us   gus  we need this to play out in front of an  audience with all the major players in place   yes  hello   i'm calling from the mccallum residence   there's an intruder here who simply won't leave   he's claiming to be a psychic that works for your department   mr  mccallum is enraged   and he wants this handled by the highest authority possible   please send the chief immediately   did you really vomit   who called them   i don't know  sir  maybe the back staff   those two gentlemen have not left the driveway   would you like me to send them all away   no   let's finish this   as you can see  karen  this simply cannot happen   it'll be taken care of  believe me   he was given clear instructions to stay away   i understand  but     yeah  it's times like this i remember why i love my job so much   any time  shawn   he's getting cocky   give it a sec   we're gonna be in a city jail in a sec   uh huh  here we are   oh  i'm sorry   did that hurt   ah  something's happening   gus   something's happening   the dog  shut up   he's biting the intruder   he knows him   it's someone he knows   the dogs knows him  stop talking   ouch  ow   the teeth are digging in   shut up  oh  there's blood   it's him  it's mccallum   i can see his face   the killer is mccallum   check his wrist   check his right wrist   the teeth marks will match up   get him out of here   check the wrist   no one is checking any part of me   why not   huh   we can close this out immediately   discredit him right here   that's an awful wound you have bandaged there   this is outrageous   do you really want to do this   we could do this now     or i could call in a warrant   i'll call my lawyer   i'll be right here   i see a doctor   i'm seeing a doctor  dr  bendali   and a word   consumine   yeah  it's for dog bites   the wound is fresh   check the wound   it's a fresh wound   it's still a fresh wound   it was an accident   i  i didn't   what   sergeant   come this way  sir   you want to take these cuffs off of me  please   thank you   seriously     how   i wish i knew   do you think this pretty much ruins my chances with katarina   there she is   don't ever walk into my office without knocking   i'm sorry  i got excited   you know what i'll do to you   yes  you do   i'm a psychic   i'm just finishing up in here  i'll be with you in a moment   that's all right  karen   i've gotta get going anyway   thank you very much for coming down   you've been a big help   son   dad   have a seat   i was considering adding you to my speed dial  mr  spencer   but i would be remiss if i didn't do a little background check   don't you think   uh    yes   i asked your dad how long you've had the gift   look  my father's memory is pretty cloudy   oh  it certainly is   his recollection doesn't match up with your assertion at all   i can explain that   you said you've had this ability your whole life   well  whole life   i mean  it's a bit of a gray area   he said you didn't get it until you were 18   he said that   that is just like him   the man simply refuses to acknowledge my abilities  my gifts   can we discuss my fee   there's a check in the cage   sign for it and then come back in   come come back in here   why   you familiar with a chop shop in summerland   dad   so are you gonna continue with this little charade   well  it sort of gives me carte blanche  you know   i mean  i can work cases for the department   i can do private jobs   in fact  i've already got another case   be aware   this is the last time i cover for you  pal   i'm not okay with this  shawn   any of it   i don't expect you to be  dad   awesome   psych   as in   got you     or as in  psychic     you named your fake detective agency psych   why don't you just call it    hey  we're fooling you and the police department    hope we don't make a mistake and someone dies because of it     first of all  gus  that name is entirely too long   it would never fit on the window   and secondly  the best way to convince people  you're not lying to them is to tell them you are   whatever  shawn   it's your agency   go for it   actually  it's our agency   i put your name on the lease as well   tell me  does that look anything like your signature   i gave it a shot   this better be a joke   don't worry   you won't have to do a thing   i have worked out every last detail   what's your dental plan   don't get cavities   health plan   same  with hepatitis and shingles   so i'm supposed to quit my job   skip over  and do this for no guaranteed money   no guaranteed money   but all guaranteed fun   no  no more cases  shawn   it was fun for a few days   well  it's gonna have to be fun for a minimum of six months   or we'll have to pay a lease penalty   which would be a blemish on your  otherwise very impressive credit report   you solved one mystery and now you renting office space   gus  i've solved a bunch of mysteries   for instance  the mystery of who kept stealing your newspaper   answer    me   the mystery of what we're doing this weekend   hint  it involves dragsters   and finally  the mystery that is the case the chief just brought me in on   you got another case already   a car thief got poisoned by his boss   he used something over the counter   phisdine   no   phisadirble   no   phisadrine  that's it   how'd he do that   tell you on the way   just for today  right   absolutely
