an hour ago  i resigned as state's attorney of cook county   are you still involved with prostitutes  sir   thanks for playing the breadwinner for a while   it's not gonna last forever   i just wanted to say thank you for the opportunity   glad you could come aboard   not only are you coming back  to the workplace fairly late   but you have some very prominent baggage   but  hey  if she can do it  so can you   kalinda sharma  oh  the investigator   you're peter florrick's wife  that's right   last time i was in court was 13 years ago   wow  i was 12   state's attorney's here   i'm glenn childs   peter blames me for his downfall   don't make yourself collateral damage here   the day you leaked that sex tape  to the press and forced me to shield my children   that was the day i became collateral damage   you've obviously never made a woman angry before    an hour ago  i resigned as state's attorney of cook county   but i do admit to a failure of judgment  in my dealings with these women   i've never abused my office  for sexual favors   give us time to heal and rebuild their trust    trust     mom  breakfast   oh  hey  congratulations   that's great  your husband's appeal    it looks like  he could get out of prison any month now  huh   looks like it  early show had a story on it   some good stuff on you  too   did you catch it  no  missed it   yeah  i caught it online   i can send you the link  that's okay   no  no  no  it's easy   so litigation wants me on this new class action   that's where i'm headed   what about you   oh  i don't know   oh  in here  i guess   when did you say this was   may 15  four months ago   do you have anything with the date   a parking receipt   had you ever met mr  mckeon before   no   i'd seen his family on the news   i heard about their hotels and stuff  but that's about it   well  the problem here  christy   is that any civil suit  could be seen as     opportunistic   because of their money   yes   i'm sorry   but i didn't choose my rapist   this kid doesn't know what she's in for   taking on the mckeon family     alicia  if you don't mind   we just need to    no  it's all right  stay   i don't know about this   it's a criminal case  not a civil one   except the new state's attorney  rejected the charges   yeah  because it's got  duke lacrosse written all over it   oh  come on   what come on   put your politics aside  diane   you're glenn childs  you get this  dropped in your lap    a stripper  at a bachelor party  accusing the son of the most powerful family  in chicago of rape    and you don't think  it's duke lacrosse ii   he's worried about the mckeon family money   he's worried about their campaign contributions   well  i'm worried that we're overextended   how many sheffrin marks depos o we have left    we need to keep our eye on the ball   and christy is just gonna look like she's trying  to make some quick cash from the mckeon family   do you believe her   i believe a lot of things  i can't prove   all right   here's what i think   i know the mckeon family lawyer   ericcson  right   william ericcson   that's just what we need    two wills   the mckeons are gonna want to keep this out of  the press  even if he didn't do it   so my guess is they throw her some cash   maybe 50 grand or so to keep her quiet   hmm  yeah   mr  ericcson  please   tell him it's the other will   i want you to be at this lunch   don't say anything   just listen and look serious   i can do that   how you holding up here   i'm holding up   oh  yeah  how do you know her   who   christy   i don't   then why did she ask for you to be on the case   i don't know   ericcson here   will   will   i think you know why i'm calling   two months ago  peter florrick was sentenced  to ten years for bribery and corruption   today was the first step toward his release   he was known in chicago simply as  the hammer    he jailed cop killers  ceos  corrupt politicians   until  the hammer  got hammered   an hour ago  i resigned as state's attorney of cook county   within weeks  chicago's incorruptible state's attorney  found himself with all the trappings  of a modern american scandal   a rival with an eye on his job  an embarrassed wife   a blushing call girl and an r rated sex tape   does she do this for you   does she   oh  god  please  you are ama     hey  ever heard the whole thing   no   you're the only one who hasn't   everything i have on mckeon   what    i beat you three sets to two   oh  come on  you don't even believe that   this is driving me crazy   how do i know you   me   miner  parsons   layton   alicia is actually our newest junior associate   one month in   will ericcson  alicia florrick   well  it is very nice to meet you   mrs  florrick  you  too   i'm rooting for your husband   i know he has a lot of enemies in this town   but i always root for the underdog   oh  just ignore him   the only reason someone's forced out of public office  in america these days is sex   so let's talk about lloyd mckeon   it's so sad  really   i remember when you had a respectable firm  will   one that wouldn't sink to scurrilous charges like these   and what charges might those be  will   i haven't said anything yet   do you think you're the first firm  she's shopping this lawsuit to   there's nothing there   even the state's attorney     the new state's attorney      thinks there's nothing there  and yet  i got you to a settlement lunch on a half hour's notice   mrs  florrick  what would you say  to someone bringing  against a public figure just in order to gain an advantage   you want to know what i would say   i would   i would say you're trying to change the subject from rape   well  i would agree that  as offensive and misguided  as these charges are  the optics  aren't exactly in our favor   so we're willing to make an offer   it's nonnegotiable   you have till end of business day   mckeon did it   under a hundred thou  i would've said no   over a hundred thou     what about well over   if you don't mind my asking  ms  barbosa   why did you request me   i saw you on tv   i thought you'd understand  what it's like to be misunderstood   ladies   sorry about that   mckeon's lawyers made a financial offer  that diane and i actually agree on   a first   it's a cash settlement    450 000   you're kidding   we don't have to go to court   he just offered that   you'll have to sign a standard confidentiality agreement   both parties free each other of liability  and agree not to speak to anyone  including the press   what   it's standard  in civil agreements   i want everybody to know he settled   can't we tell the police   not if we sign a confidentiality agreement   mckeon could withdraw the award and sue you for defamation   what do you think   i think under the cir     i think you're looking for justice  christy   and sometimes justice comes in a form we don't expect   if you take this money  the settlement will be known  to the two people that matter most  you and him   i'm sorry  no   he'll know how much it costs to  rape somebody and get away with it  that's all   this is about him admitting that he did this to me   she's right   okay  ericcson   how flexible are you on confidentiality   exclude new criminal discovery   oh  come on  this isn't     you want to go to court  is that it   take it as far as pretrial   he doesn't want to go to trial   look  ericcson   you want to make mckeon  the bachelor party rapist   be my     that's how you want to play it   we just turned down a half million bucks   feels good  doesn't it   looks like we got a case   sync by honeybunny   corrected by chamallow35  you have to size these things up pretty quickly   no one out of control   it was easy   they paid  400 for a 90 minute  two girl fantasy strip   two girl   who was the other girl   maura     i    i don't remember her last name   that was the only time she worked   sorry   she insists on being here during all this   it's a nightmare   and mckeon   how'd you meet him   the groom   hmm  he offered me another  100  for a private lap dance   when i got in the bedroom  he locked the door   then he grabbed me   i tried to get the mace from my bag  tried to shout   did you tell anyone afterwards   maura   and our driver grant   he was the one who suggested she drive me  to the hospital for the rape exam   and the service   worldwide elite   how long did you work for them   two years  and what else did you do there   what do you mean  i mean  what else did you do there   for a year  i was an escort   didn't you think that might be important to tell us   i haven't gone on a call in a year   i was in an abusive relationship   i needed the money  to move out   when i moved  i stopped working   but still stripped   so what's your point      a call girl can't get raped   yeah  that's my point  thanks   look  she lied to us  why believe her now   'cause she walked away from half a million dollars   and when did she ever lie to us   you know  the more you bond with these clients   the less helpful you are   your stripper was hooking   why is she my stripper when she does something bad   okay  so the point is to prepare for trial  so we don't actually have to go to trial   cary  right   yes  sir   nice suit  i got a job for you   i need you to take  alicia's sheffrin marks depos for the week   all right  i'm on it   this is settlement poker   no one wants to go to trial   but the person who plays the better hand  makes the better deal   so get me some good cards   so your first thought is  to come to the state attorney's office   i just need one thing   and why do i help you  again   because you like me   that still works with people   mm hmm  like a charm   you never should have quit this place   i didn't quit  i was fired   come on   you ran a solid rape investigation   you should be dying to slip us  the witness interviews   leah   could you come outside for a second   and you're telling me your husband  had nothing to do with this   mr  childs  my law firm is bringing on  a civil action  that's all   designed to embarrass my office  and make it look like i don't care about a rape victim   a happy coincidence   i understand the need to blame someone  for your husband's downfall   but i didn't release that sex tape  to hurt you or your family   i have kids  too   and you should know i was holding back   i had more to release about your husband   a lot more   disturbing things   but out of compassion  i held back   mr  childs  if you have something to show me   just do it  okay   'cause the one thing i don't have time for  these days is empty threats   you want something  on your stripper  get a subpoena   i liked christy   she was one of my best dancers   but i have nothing else to add   i'm sorry   we just need contact information   that's all  ms  avarski   for the driver and the stripper   dancer   look  i would love     because we'd really hate  to subpoena your books and client records   you're east indian   yeah   hmm  it's very popular  these days   contact information   follow me   why a b c    1 500 an hour    2 100 and  uh    3 100   what makes someone more expensive   is this about the rape   no   regular clients  and special requests   requests   no condoms  or being dominated or role playing   whatever they can't get at home   people would really pay  3 000 an hour   the day rate is   31 000  dawn to dawn   so about this rape  can you get me contact information  on this dancer   maura  she quit right afterwards   left a fake number   fake address  fake social   happens all the time   what about the driver  could you help me find him   zach so  mom  where are you  anyway   look  i have to work late tonight   can you ask grandma if she can stay till 10 00   sure   grandma  can you stay till 10 00   mom's working late   no need to shout  dear   if she has to  she has to   grandma can stay   so  mom  i was talking to grandma   and she said she visited dad  this weekend  and he was saying  how much he missed us   grandma said that   i was thinking maybe we should be going there   you know  visiting him   your dad didn't want you to see him like that in prison   he was     he didn't want you to worry   but let me ask him    maybe he's changed his mind  okay   right   we'll talk about it when i get home tonight  okay   all right  see you tonight   i trust you're doing your homework   five minutes   we understand you can corroborate christy's story   which was   that she told you about the rape right after it happened   look  i like christy  she's a good tipper   but when she drinks  she doesn't know what the hell  she's talking about   but you do   christy gave the guy a lap dance   he paid her  we went home   nobody said anything about any rape   i don't blame christy for trying  to get extra money out of mckeon   but  hey  she's lying   is that dad   i don't know   but you're thinking it  too   gonna need your help in a minute   dad told us he made mistakes   yeah  but not that   do we tell mom   they sent them to mom  to hurt her   so i say no   so   i don't know   do they want to see me   oh  zach does  but grace doesn't   she's hurt   she thought you were everything   so two months in  you seem well   i am  some good guys here   there's probably less backstabbing  than the state attorney's office   you look good   it's like it agrees with you   so  here's the thing about childs   everything he does is a political calculation   everything he says    peter  no   i don't want to be used   alicia  i know you don't believe me   but childs set me up   and if what i give you can help a rape victim   what's wrong with that   how do you know she's a rape victim  peter   i didn't tell your mom   daniel told me   your appellate lawyer   he's the one who referred christy to you   what's wrong   i'm hard pressed to think what's not wrong   so he what      well     i mentioned to daniel  that you were with stern  lockhart   and that if he didn't have time for christy's case  that maybe you would   i thought you'd want the work   you thought it was a good idea  to send me a hooker to represent   no  i thought it was a good idea to send you a rape victim   oh  my god   you had sex with her   what   you're using her first name  peter   you're saying  christy    she's one of your whores   oh  alicia  would you stop it   when are you gonna stop thinking that i slept with everyone   when are you gonna forgive me  for christ sakes   how much did you spend on amber   you had sex with her  what   ten times  20 times   you don't want to know the details of what i did   if you want me to forgive you   i need to know what i'm forgiving you for   so 3 000  a pop  that's what 60 000    did you pay her not to use a condom  was that extra   your trip to houston  did you take her with you   you know i didn't   i don't know what i know   grace's 12th birthday party  you s     you said you had to leave early   where did you go  peter   you answer those questions  and then we will talk  about forgiveness   this is a pretrial hearing   so don't worry about the driver yet   we just need to win a few motions   sorry   don't worry about it   it all comes down to the rape kit   still no luck finding the other stripper   all we have is a first name   maura    and a general description   we need to box mckeon in   there's only one of two ways  his semen ends up in that rape kit   consensual sex or rape   we get him to swear there was no consensual sex   why would he do that   'cause he has a wife   there you are   how you doing   you nervous   no  but maybe i should be   this is just a pretrial hearing   state's attorney's trying to squash our subpoena   so today we just get the ground rules  straight  in case this thing goes to trial   kalinda  i need you to get upstairs  get in  the state's attorney's office and wait for the subpoena   i'll do that   what  you don't have to   i know  i'll be back   you all right   yeah  sure  i'm fine   oh  my god  this is too good   we got judge abernathy   he's our newest judge  he's so liberal   he makes michael moore look like rush limbaugh   justice may be blind  but judges sure aren't   god  ericcson must be pulling his hair out   all rise for judge abernathy   oh  please  don't stand   everybody sit back down  please   we've got the big room here  don't we   your honor  given the stature of my client  mr  mckeon   and given the fact that this pretrial  hearing has already garnered the attention  of our friends in the press   we would ask the court to seal the pretrial filings  and avoid a show trial   oh  mr  ericcson  i don't think we need to do all that   do we  first amendment issues and all   i deny the petition with regret   mr  gardner   yes  your honor   we have a lot of testimony  focusing on whether there was a consensual act  between mr  mckeon  and my client  but if mr  mckeon  is willing to stipulate  there was  indeed  a consensual sexual act   we would forego this testimony   that's a good point  mr  ericcson  how do you respond   we will stipulate there was no sex of any kind   forced or consensual  your honor   the plaintiff also requests an expedited trial date   your honor  a dna sample from mr  mckeon   dna results from the rape kit  and the investigative reports  from the state's attorney's office   they have been    reluctant to furnish them   thank you  counselor  i will grant all four motions   mr   uh    ericcson   ah  i interpret from mr  ericcson's  uh  gesture  that he acquiesces   well  i'll see you all back here     let's see  my docket is clear   five days   how's that for expedited   uh  as a side note  i would like to ask for a moment of silence  for the recent mass killings in darfur   okay  thank you   court adjourned   that was a great start  huh   i understand you're having trouble with the driver   and you're boxed in on the rape kit   you should just settle on our terms   yeah  right  see you in trial   may 15  four months ago   this one seemed cool   hey  so you know will    mr  gardner  you two went to school together   that's what they were saying the other night at drinks   yeah   so that's why   cary  if you don't mind  i've had only a week with this   you got an expedited trial date  to force the other side to settle   and now you guys are the ones suffering   what are you looking for    tzk industries    i    i've seen it somewhere before   what is tzk industries    tzk industries    it's a furniture supply company    supplying elegant furniture  to home and business   why  what do you need   something to undercut christy's driver   okay   oh   it can't be that easy  can it   what   so i find this odd  mr  grant   you were there  and you say there was no rape   so either you're lying  or my client's lying   all i know is what i saw   your honor  request permission to approach the witness   yes  please  approach   mr  grant  this is a copy of your wife's w 2   could you read the name of your wife's employer  please    tzk industries    and tzk industries is a company owned  by the mckeon family to supply furniture  to their properties  objection  not in evidence   well  i think it's all right for it to be asked   mr  ericcson   i    actually  sustained   your honor  you sustained the objection   i did  mr  ericcson had a point   isn't it an amazing coincidence  mr  grant   that after a year of unemployment   your wife got a job in june from the mckeon family   a month after the bachelor party incident  no   and why is that  mr  grant   because my wife and i are divorced   my wife and i have been separated for a year now   so her getting this job has nothing to do with me   but  sir  wouldn't you benefit  even if only in the form of lowered spousal support   i guess  but i'm not warren buffett   no further questions  your honor   i'm sorry  i didn't see it   don't ever let your first chair get undercut like that again   good news   i just got the rape kit results   state's attorney wasn't stonewalling   they sent it out to a commercial lab and just got it back   and   it's not mckeon's dna   the rape kit came back  it's not his sperm   it's not mckeon's dna   grant says you're lying  mckeon says you're lying   i'm not lying  i     it's really not his sperm   christy  we need to get the full      who else did you have sex with that night  no one  i swear   well  you obviously had sex with someone  because it isn't his sperm   so  was it a boyfriend or another client   you need to find maura   we can't find maura   you really don't remember anything  to help us find her  we can't find maura   we didn't talk   she was on her cell phone  the whole night till her battery ran out   i'm sorry   i need to get to class   not that i mind it  but since when did you become me   you didn't believe her  i did   maybe she is telling the truth   christy said the light was flicked out   so maybe mckeon was with a friend   so let's see if the cops tested the other party goers   worth a try   it's not just that   what's up with your bud  abernathy   he's going out of his way to kill us   you know how this works  liberal judge gets on the bench   doesn't want to rule from his bias   so he bends over backwards the other way   i thought you said you had some pull with him   he wanted to be on your glass ceiling committee  or whatever it is   emily's list    are you suggesting i influence a sitting judge  in some untoward fashion   no  just in a toward one   come on  come to the court  let him see  your sad little liberal face     and contemplate a life without his friends   will  i'm so sorry   don't be  we're a team   no apologies   hey   now what are you doing  close the door   come on  zach  just let it go   would you shut up and look at this   see that   it's called a  specular highlight    it's like a light in the eye reflected in the eye   see where it is   it's to the left   and now  look at this   the lady's eye  see   the dot's to the right   okay     they're not in the same picture   dad's face was photoshopped into it   hello  zach  grace  i'm home   jackie  i have a request to make   certainly  dear   you want the kids to visit peter in prison  you talk to me   you don't talk to zach   when did i talk to zach   you told him peter was lonely in prison   because he is   just don't go around me by talking to my kids   hey  mom  hey   how was work   it was crappy   i thought i'd make breakfast   for dinner   my goodness   like when you were little   you don't have to like it  it's for me   so  i want to show you some pictures  of where dad's staying   what   i want to make sure you know what's involved  with visiting dad in prison  okay   i'll get that   so  zach  can you show me how  to get to  google images  on your computer   yeah  sure   what is that   nothing  homework   mom   someone's here   hi  still no maura   dna is definitely not from mckeon's semen   i was going to the crime lab to see if they ever collected dna  from the other party goers when     you can watch a little tv   i'll be right in   want to do this later   no  no  no   i think i just caught my son checking out porn   anyway     i asked a cop friend  to run the rape kit results through codis   and they got a hit   who  the best man   manny lyons  a rapist serving  i don't understand   you're in good company   and he's a convicted rapist   christy was raped   apparently   i don't get it   was he     was he at the party   well  as far as i can tell  he was in a holding cell  in columbus at the time   this makes no sense   we know   this pile is everything on the manny lyons rape   this pile  everything on ours   and we can't find one thing in common   no connection with mckeon   nope  we checked it    manny lyons broke into an upper arlington apartment   held a knife to the neck of a  raped her  and stole her car   he was stopped running a traffic light ten miles away   the divorcee identified him in a six pack photo line up    what   they do have one thing in common   and you were the lab supervisor who worked on analysis 5795      the rape kit in this case    professor   doctor  doctor   and these are your initials   gg    right at the bottom of the report   yes  those are mine   oh  uh  excuse me   this isn't 5795  yes  this is 5794   the manny lyons case  my mistake   oh  i see that you ran the analysis on both cases   given the sequential numbering   i imagine that you worked on one right after the other   it appears so   in both cases  the dna matched the same culprit   manny lyons  is that correct   it is   so let     let me follow the logic here   manny lyons     who never set foot in chicago     objection  not in evidence   i will sustain that   isn't it true  dr  girtzman   the only connection between manny lyons and christy barbosa  is that you worked on both cases   objection  argumentative   mrs  florrick  this is not a debating society   sustained   dr  girtzman   would you say  that the standard of a commercial lab is relaxed   no  and  uh  your honor   may i answer  her earlier question   personal privilege  oh  yeah  if you'd like   we handle an immense backlog of untested rape kits  from crime labs all across the country   we do so with speed and professionalism     and yet isn't it true  sir   that your lab almost lost  its accreditation in 2005     now  that was never proved  when it cross contaminated  two dna samples that were out sourced  from a crime lab    this is an old slander   that you failed to sterilize scissors  that then carried the dna from one sample to the next   i don't have to answer this  actually  you do  sir   your honor  given this testimony   we move that the rape kit be reexamined  at a second genetic lab   i think that is  an understandable request  mr  ericcson   your honor  we would stipulate  that mrs  florrick has proven her case   dr  girtzman cross contaminated the sample     excuse me  but we would argue  therefore   that that is the very reason it cannot be tested again   you've got to be kidding me   the very fact that it is agreed that the sample  is now contaminated means it can't possibly  be tested with any authority   your honor     mr  gardner  you argued that the rape kit was contaminated   you can't now  argue it's probative   the plaintiff's motion for retesting is denied   your honor     motion is denied   we've got to find that other stripper   so basically this is  a hail mary pass   look at you with the sports metaphors   yeah  i don't see many other options here   good evening   do you have a reservation   actually  we have a    strange request   we need to get a printout of a phone bill  from four months ago   the name   mckeon   first name   lloyd   would you liked that e mailed or a hard copy   hard copy   if i could just see some i d   mr  mckeon   um  well  actually can i ask you a question      rosemary   there was a bachelor party here  in may that resulted in a    a rape   were you here then   i was   well  the only person we believe who can corroborate  the rape victim's story was using a cell phone that night   and we're thinking she used the bathroom phone  when her battery ran out   we were hoping to glance at the bill  just to see if there was a number she dialed   i'll have to speak to a manager   nice thought   if all else fails  try honesty   i got 20 bucks on deception   will   oh  hey   what are you doing north of the loop   you know  just seeing how the other half lives   alicia   this is marlena   nice to meet you   hi   ask for a view of the lake   it's beautiful at night   she thinks we're getting a room   yep   now they all think we're getting a room   you worried  you   we could do worse   i'm having trouble getting my manager   if you could just wait another minute   i owe you  20   okay  christy and maura arrived at 10 15   right there  11 20   out of state area code   hello  you don't know me     were you the other dancer there that night  maura   i was  yes   and your driver  mr  grant   what did he tell you after you took christy to the hospital   he told us that the mckeons were very rich   and we should all keep our mouths shut   and that's why you went back home to michigan   yes   i'm sorry  i was scared   and to reiterate   christy told you about the rape immediately afterward   yes  in fact  he  followed her out intoarking lot  and he said   don't tell anyone   just take the money and shut up    no further questions  your honor   thank you  alicia   for    you know   christy  i'm just curious   where did you meet my husband   your husband   i've never met your husband   my mistake   all rise for judge abernathy   good afternoon   i have given this case quite a bit of thought   as you can imagine   you have both argued your case well   but i find myself judging in favor of the defendant   without a dna match  to the rape kit  we have a classic  he said  she said  and as much  as my personal sympathies lie with the plaintiff   the evidence does not warrant a favorable decision   judgment in favor of the defense   are you okay   no   i'm sorry   i believe you   this is all i want to say   i have been falsely accused by a woman  who wanted nothing more than a quick payday   but every year there are thousands of women  who are abused   and i don't think we should let this false accusation     mr  mckeon   you're under arrest for the rape of christy barbosa   wha      cuff him  what   is this a joke   it must be hard to lose  mrs  florrick   not if it forces you to prosecute   i'm coming out of this with a criminal case i'll win   and you're coming out with a loss   nice job   lloyd mckeon was arrested today for rape   literally seconds after he was cleared in a civil case  for the identical crime   state's attorney glenn childs took credit for finding  an untainted sample of dna  that will guarantee mckeon's conviction in a criminal trial   childs denied that mckeon's arrest was a reaction to     this is yours   yeah   is he going to jail   i think so   well  then that's good   thanks   good night  good night   what do you want me to do   i want you to beg   please    oh    does she do this for you   does she  oh  god  please     you're amazing     what do you want me to do   what do you want me to do to you   just    don't    stop   what'll you give me   what'll you give me not to stop   everything   sync by honeybunny   corrected by
