naked as far as i'm concerned   how'd it go with the kids today   oh  travis asked again whether daddy hadn't called   and katie wanted to skype him   it's been tough   what'd you tell them   i said what you said to say   i said that daddy has to focus on getting a job now   and they have to focus on getting ready for spring sing   and he loves them to pieces   i hate lying to them   i know you're going through a lot right now   i had the same feeling when your daddy abandoned me   mama  daddy died of a stroke  this is not the same thing   felt the same   he left me all alone to raise an 8 year old   but i bounced right back  didn't i   you married someone else not even three months later   well  that's some kind of bounce  now  isn't it   the lord never intended for women to be on their own   oh  mama   i know it's tough  but you've got to open up  to whatever the next chapter of your life might be   oh  that feels incredible   i love trying out the new girls   that's what i

leave riley be   she doesn't need you filling her head with your crazy ideas   oh  please   tell you what's crazy is you still playing it legit  after all these years   just not worth it to me   she's always complaining about us giving extras  when she can barely pay her rent   they think i'm weird about sex   no one's saying that   but anything i learn here about men  doesn't go to waste when it comes to me and my fianc     wait  so  he knows what goes on here with your clients   do i look like a fool   bobby has my heart  and that's what counts   but my business is my business   well  duke

happened before   and you didn't do anything about it  why didn't you tell me   well  i don't like to upset my girls  so you just ignore it   look  i can't come out to my car like this   unlike you  i've got a family to worry about   well  my girls are my family   and i have been running a nice  successful business here  for the last three years all by myself   ever since my husband left me with

off the phone with mr  marshall   and he said that you are not participating  in the rehearsals for spring sing   you know the dance now  you love to sing   what does it matter if daddy won't be there   he won't be back  will he   baby  right now i'm not sure when he's gonna be back   but  hey  i do know this   he loves you so much   more than anything  just like i do   you know what   you do not have to be in the spring sing   i will call mr  marshall tomorrow morning   let me sleep with it   or sleep on it   okay   eskimo kiss   hey  you okay  it's late   we need to talk   i know how you've been making all that money at that new job of yours   what the hell are you talking about   well  i was out  having a few beers   and it was so obvious once i started thinking about it   so why don't you just come out and admit it  riley   i mean  kyle's hardly gone  and you stoop to this   what's his name   whose name   your sugar daddy   you think i have a sugar daddy   yeah  from work  right   i mean  a friend of mine at the bank said you came in  and you paid your mortgage in cash   how else could you be bringing home that kind of money   wow   wow  that is so    that's so insulting   i mean  i happen to be very good at my job   why is that so hard for everybody to understand    'cause it doesn't add up  that's why   i'll tell you what adds up   i am fighting tooth and nail to provide for my family  after the most traumatic event in my life   your brother    settle down      walking out on me  and the last thing i need  is you coming over here after a few drinks     look  i just    i just was        making wild accusations  no  what   i just was     i just was    what   i was just confused  that's what   god  how drunk are you   riley  look  you     no  now  you have said enough  you go home   and why don't you keep your crazy judgments about my life  to yourself from now on   you got that  now  get on out of here   hell  you'd think we'd be busier with the rodeo in town   the gay rodeo  jolene  didn't you read the signs   the gay rodeo  you kidding me   count me in  sounds frisky   is nothing sacred   at least somebody's busy today   i heard about your special therapy sessions with jared dawson   he's been singing your praises to anyone who'll listen   you do know clients don't come in here to talk   well  i was just trying to help   not so smart long term   sending the clients back to their wives   i think he just wanted to be listened to   like we all do   sorry  honey  but you don't get to make decisions  that affect all of us   maybe you just feel guilty   they don't have what you have     some perfect marriage to come home to every night   um  not so perfect   kyle left me right after i started here   and i have no idea if he's ever coming back   what did you do  i didn't know   hey  i was looking for you   why  so you can get all upset again   i'm sorry about that   i didn't know that your husband had left you   his loss  i'm doing just fine on my own   you know  the thing is  i just can't have people writing on my car like that   i get it  no job is perfect   i wish i could control the entire universe  but i can't   it's more than that   i just want a job that i can feel proud of   trust me  honey  we all do   i'm just not sure that this is the right thing for me   well  that's something you're gonna have to figure out  on your own   oh  you have goto be kidding me   you're valerie dawson  right  you wrote all over my car   are you out of your freaking mind   i don't know what you're talking about   but i want you to stay away from my husband   nothing is going on with me and jared   i'm just listening to him   oh  and i suppose he hasn't done anything with any of  those other girls  either   i honestly don't know   but when he's with me  on my table   he is telling me how much he loves you   i find that very hard to believe   do you know  that he doesn't think you give a crap about him anymore   he thinks you just care more about your friends  and your charities than you do him   that's ridiculous   then why does he feel so lonely   look  i know that there are two sides to this  but trust me   a man does not go looking elsewhere  if he's getting what he needs at home   oh  hell   you're not getting what you need  either  are you   but there was a time you were   he told me   if you love him  you still have a chance   what should i do   tell him you want him back   and that whatever he's done   it's in the past  it's over   you love him  and you want to move on   why are you crying   because that's something  i'll probably never get the chance to do   but you can do it right now  you can go home   and then screw the living daylights out of him   good luck   same to you   mommy  i used too much hair gel   it's gonna ruin the show   good lord  you look like a wet possum   mama  that's really not helping   now  travis  i said just to use a dab   well  daddy always helps me do it   it's okay  i can fix this   it's nothing compared to the disasters down at the salon   come on  possum   oh  no   katie  you look so cute   hey  i thought you weren't gonna be in the show   what made you change your mind   i want you to be proud of me   oh  baby  i always am   now got get your brother 'cause he's running late   oh   um  i i just wanted to say something real quick   yeah  okay  come on in   look  i    i'm real sorry about that sugar daddy comment  the other night   i it was totally out of line   it upset you  i i was real drunk   you weren't that drunk  evan   you gonna make this even harder than it is   besides  the backyard still needs to be mowed   let me    let me at least do that   promise to keep my shirt on this time   fine   and i can go to the kids' show  right   yes  of course you can   okay  want me to shut this   please   it's a good look for you  by the way   go   for the first time in 30 years   i think riley might just take my advice   tell my boss he does     mama  we're here to watch the show   riley   riley   i'll be right back   hey  hey   i can't believe you're here   i just happened to be in the neighborhood   come on   this is the last place
