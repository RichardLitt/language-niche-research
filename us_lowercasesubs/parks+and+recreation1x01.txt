all of your questions   so fire away   well it's a great day because uh last month they put me in jail   that's right   the uh the head of the police is a ninth degree mason   but the music is so loud   stop the graffiti please please   i don't like obscenities ju   just as much as you don't like them   no it drives me crazy i have kids    hey my  and the guy's  you  my you head      these people are members of a community that care about where they live   so what i hear when i'm being yelled at is people caring loudly at me   now i have a few t ngs i want to say about laura linney   thank you so much barry   always great to have you here   anyone else who would like to contribute    i'm ann perkins   uh i'm a nurse and frankly i don't really care for politics   uh but um i'm   i'm here to talk about the abandoned lot on sullivan street   excellent that sounds like a good idea tell us about that   no it's a problem   it almost killed my boyfriend   yeah   there's a lot nearby my house and a developer dug out a basement for some condos   and then they went bankrupt   so there's just this giant pit and it's been there for almost a year    yeah and um my boyfriend who is a musician   actually   i support him   but anyway he fell in and broke both his legs   ann let me speak with you for a minute   so your boyfriend fell down into this pit right   yes   and um this guy   is it pretty serious are you guys living together   yes   uh i'm sure this must be really tough for you   you know just   this guy   sounds like he didn't have a lot going on for him to start with   and now both legs broken he's just weak   you have to take care of him     you probably feel like you need to move on   why    what does this    just become more adventurous in relationships with your body just in    are you  are you actually hitting on me right now   oh oh god no   i'm not   i'm not hitting on you i'm actually married   i'm just an open person and i like connecting with people   i'm you know very comfortable around women attractive women   i've spent a lot of time with them and i just   i  i don't know   i feel like we might be taking up too much of the forum's time   maybe we can just exchange numbers   you know maybe go away one weekend and just kind of talk about this   look   i'd love to do it   the bottom line is i've been trying to get this thing fixed for months and nobody's done anything   and it's ugly and it's dangerous and it's government owned and you need to do something about it   okay     i'll do something about it    really   yes we   i will help you   is that a promise   it's more than a promise   it's a pinky promise   i pinky promise all of you that i will help and i will go to that location tomorrow  and we will fill in that pit and then when that's done we're gonna put a park on the land   okay   well i've worked at the parks department for six years and i've handled a lot of things that i'm proud of   recently i led a city wide drive to disinfect the sandbox sand after we had those problems with the cats   but this pit   the chance to build a whole new park from scratch    this could be my hoover dam   no that sounds great   um problem is anything over  25 i have to report   so um maybe give my wife a call and give her the suits   and then if they don't fit her maybe she'll give 'em to me   morning   all right mr  mayor   that sounds good   i'll see you on saturday for the uh ultimate frisbee game   bye   leslie hello   you were talking to the mayor   yep we was rappin' about some things   tom and i work really well together   we're both outsiders   i'm a woman he's a    oh i think he's a libyan   i am from bennettsville south carolina   i am what you might call a  redneck      okay brainstorm   how do we make this park happen   let's go to the city council directly and ask them to put up the money   no parks are not a priority   i need more firepower   i need bigger guns   you know what i need to do form a committee right   yeah that could work   yeah 'cause committees are power and committees make things happen   committees are the lifeblood of our democratic system   that's really good write that down   yep   from time to time when i think of an eloquent saying or a phrase i have tom write it down   he's collecting them for my memoirs   here's leslie's quote from wednesday   okay read it back to me    committees cover our democracy with blood     sounded better when i said it   it's still good though   okay i have an idea   what about bringing mark on board     which mark    which mark   mark brendanawicz which mark   well if you want something done in this town you call mark brendanawicz because   you know he's a city planner but he's more than that he's kind of like a fixer   he fixes things he's a smart capable guy   he just  he knows where the bodies are buried   what's up brendanawicz   you crazy old polish person   city hall is like a locker room and you gotta get in there and you gotta snap towels at people  and you gotta give 'em the business and if you can't take it   you know you  you   then you can't take it   you  you gotta leave    the locker room   let's get down to brass tacks   i know you don't have a lot of time and i want to thank you for meeting me today   i just work right there   well thank you for clearing your schedule   oh i didn't clear anything   you know this lot that i'm talking about right   uh yeah lot 48   um condo developer   he dug a basement and then he went bankrupt   i checked it out like a month ago   it's pretty gross   what would you say if i told you that i was thinking about turning it into a park   a park huh   okay   well when i think about the logistics the various hoops that you're gonna have to jump through   i would say   is it likely   no it's not likely you know   but is it possible   no it's not possible   i would give up on that one   what why   why uh i don't know there's like a million reasons why   uh homeowners' associations anti government nuts bureaucrats miles of red tape    really it sounds like you're telling me to go for it   there's no way it can happen   i can do this   i just need a little help   could you do me a favor   for old times' sake   mark and i   it's complicated   when you work closely with someone and you share similar interests  and you have a similar worldview and you're passionate about the same things things can happen   we slept together   leslie   no   oh my god   you know what   yeah we did like five years ago   i'd sort of    no but yeah yeah we did   honey can you straighten up your area a little bit   'cause they're gonna be here soon   can   thanks   that parks lady is coming over and we're gonna go take a look at the pit   i  i think it's probably just a photo op for her   i mean i don't think anybody in government actually cares about    honey do you mind doing that somewhere else   i'm trying to watch tv   i'm talking about the pit you fell in   it's ms perkins' house   doorbell   yeah i heard it   doorbell   i heard it i'm getting it   i'm here   look at that   safety   you remember tom from last night     hey ann how are you    yeah hey of course i do   and this is our college intern april   she's going to be documenting our fact finding mission   hey april   is this fun for you   yeah it's so much fun   uh i'm just gonna grab my phone quickly   this must be our hero   the man heard 'round the world   how you doin' son   pretty good   i'm leslie knope   and the entire government of pawnee would like to let you know that we will do everything we can to help you   could you pass me my itch stick   of course   so um andy jumped over this fence   he was crossing through to get home and then he fell right there   oh my god   how did we let this happen   dream with me for a second ann   doesn't this neighborhood deserve a first class park   imagine a shiny new playground with a jungle gym and swings pool tennis courts   volleyball courts racquetball courts basketball court regulation football field   we could put an amphitheatre over there with shakespeare in the park   it's really not that big of a pit   we could do some of those things   it's gonna take a little extra work   but why not try   i think that would be great   me too   i'm going in     why    't w donorry i have a hard hat on     i can see that but    yeah     april document this    okay why   the key to any fact finding mission is to get right into the battle zone you know   it's like george bush when he flew over new orleans or richard nixon when he went to china to see what the chinese were up to   no   leslie are you okay   leslie   hold o april's gonna get some photos for the website   can you just be still   don't move around as much   okay squeeze my fingers   good   does it hurt a lot   no   i'm fine   no you're not   good thing i was wearing that hard hat   but it   it fell off   after my head hit that rod   i can't believe you fell in too that's awesome   it's not awesome andy   well at least my boss will listen to me now that i broke my clavicle   it's not broken   it is   do you have one of those neck foam collar brace things   honestly you're   you're fine   oh honestly my clavicle's broken   oh hey baby if you're going to the kitchen could you make me pancakes real quick   uh sure   ooh are

is that a travel pillow around your neck   ron i don't know how to explain this to you   when you've been down in the pit   have you been in the pit   no i haven't gotten down there yet     well i have   when you fell in   when i visited the bottom of the pit on a fact finding mission   and when you're down there you get some perspective about what it all means   and let me tell you something ron   what it means is    i want this subcommittee   i've been quite open about this around the office   i don't want this parks department to build any parks because i don't believe in government   i think that all government is a waste of taxpayer money   my dream is to have the park system privatized and run entirely for profit by corporations       chuck e cheese                                      chuck e cheese      well i will definitely think about it   i like the sound of that  definitely     i'm gonna leave before you change your mind   mr  swanson i presume   lot 48 thoughts   yes no

your decision is   someone on the phone about the park   you know i don't think i even want it   oh man   the clavicle's still really hurting me   this is a great shot   i know   that's awesome   i think she's crying in that one look at this one   hey kids   that's another good one   hey brendanawicz   you gotta come check this out   leslie took us out to that pit in lot 48 and she fell inside

don't worry i can print more   leslie is unique   um government work can beat you down   i would say that i lost my optimism about government in about two months   leslie's kept hers for six years   i've got a few rules about how to survive and prosper in a government job   and i think i'm about to break one of those rules   i want you to give lot 48 to leslie so she can try to build a park   why
