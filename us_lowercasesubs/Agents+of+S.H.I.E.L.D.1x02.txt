   1  h q   s h i e l d  6 1 6  you have course confirmation   you are cleared direct to the slingshot   agent coulson  everything all right up there   we heard you had a little dustup on the ground   coulson  yeah  we're all good   it's gonna be blue skies from here on out       aah   aaaaah   simmons  coulson  hang on   sync   corrections by honeybunny  hey  no joy rides  okay   that's my house       where do they think of this stuff   ward  skye  girl's not qualified to be a s h i e l d  agent   agreed  that's why i've invited her on as a consultant     s h i e l d  does it all the time   technically  stark's a consultant   and technically  skye's a member of the rising tide   she hacked our rsa implementation     twice  from a laptop   imagine what she'll do with our resources   i am   that's exactly what i'm imagining during this frown   you brought me on for risk assessment   she's a risk   she doesn't think like us   exactly   oh  agent coulson told us the news   what a wonderful surprise   isn't it  fitz  yeah   no  it's wonderful  yeah  a surprise   you must be very excited   yep  first day of school     okay  so    just    sorry   yeah   we have two kids on this bus who aren't cleared for combat   you're adding a third   at least fitz simmons are trained s h i e l d  scientists   but skye  you said this was a select team   assembled to work new cases  to protect people   i don't see how letting some hacker tag along     i'm looking for an objection i haven't already anticipated   i'm calling this   but your frown will be on record   we've been called in to investigate an 0 8 4   we all know what that means   yes  we do   it means we don't know what that means   fitz  officially  it's an airborne mobile command station   but we call it the bus   we find it best to use shorthand when in the field   but everything has to be just so  you know   because of the danger   yeah  i've been up here before   but i didn't see much because of the bag  that agent ward put over my head   yes  so sorry about that   water   may  wheels up in two  lock it or lose it   what's that mean   no backing out now   let's find a bunk for our guest   oh  oh  yeah  there's only one left   and it's right next to mine   sorry  you can       hey  i know we didn't really     might want to read that   this isn't like other planes   you can say that again   say what again   sweet ride   i earned a little goodwill from director fury  when i got hit right before the battle of new york   you took a bullet   ish   an asgardian stabbed me through the heart  with a chitauri scepter   the effect was similar   got a few weeks' r r and this plane   had it completely refurbished  studs up    spared no expense   yeah  agent ward told me they sent you to tahiti   it's a magical place   you mentioned that   here   use a coaster   buckle up   i don't even know where we're going    peru  that's where the 0 8 4 was reported   and an 0 8 4 is      an object of unknown origin   kind of like you   team goes in  determines if it's useful  or if it poses a threat   last one turned out to be pretty interesting   and what was the last one   a hammer     tire tracks 40 meters back   i'll check them against the site's trucks     make sure we're alone   too much exposure here   i'm gonna find a place to park     i would love to see a capuchin in the wild   maybe even a yellow tailed woolly monkey   you know  um  peru has  yeah  and close to 200 species of snakes   the shushupe has a fascinating ven   venom   it's neurotoxic  proteolytic  and hemolytic      that's fascinating   yeah   oh   no  i'd be much more concerned  with earthquakes  mala     ah  there's no vaccine for dengue fever     oh  look at this   we should warn the people who live around here  if the 0 8 4 is dangerous   they're already dealing with anti mining rebels  and the shining path guerillas   i could post something   remember the panic when that anti matter meteor  splashed down just off the coast of miami   nearly devoured the city  no   precisely  because we kept it quiet and contained   so  what am i doing   well  if it gets out  i might need you to create some kind of diversion   put the public on the wrong scent   so everything that i'm against   yep     good morning  professor   i'm agent coulson with s h i e l d   i understand you've made an interesting discovery    i i'm not sure how to explain it   this temple dates back at least 500 years   it's filled with pre incan artifacts   one of them is impossible  and looks like it might be dangerous   well  that's why we're here   watch out   exactly as we found it   who else knows about this   just the ministry   i believe they are the ones who contacted you   sir  i need you and your team to evacuate the site  until we determine the risk associated with this object     leave the man alone   now    for your own safety   nothing about this anywhere   it's amazing   i searched every data stream   what do you got here  guys   whoa  car   uh  careful  i i    no  wouldn't do that   the object's placement in fossiliferous rock formations  suggests it's been here for at least 1 500 years   that pre dates this temple by a millennium   ah  maybe it's alien   yeah  but the shape and the craftsmanship     it's almost german     tires match the prof's truck   where's your sidearm   if i need a gun  i'll take one   right  forgot i was working with  the cavalry    don't ever call me that   apologies   i've heard the stories     what went down in in bahrain  about you in action   you know  it was smart of coulson  to pull you out of retirement   it's nice to have a trusted friend  who has your back         should have taken more guns       ward  sir  go   we have a situation   lots of rebels in this area   not enough gunfire   keep working  i'm on my way   buenos dias  soy agente coulson  estamos aqu   por un astoto de la seguridad internacional   phillip   camilla   phillip  do you mind   after you       and now for a proper hello   comandante    a promotion  congratulations   three years ago  but thank you   agent melinda may  agent grant ward   this is comandante camilla reyes   she's with the polic  a militar del per     we used to work together back in the day     let the team know everything's okay   reyes  i know you've found a strange object  on peruvian soil   we should have a conversation about how to proceed   of course   but an 0 8 4 supercedes all national claims   you look good   yeah  i work out   come  let me show you something     are you seeing this  it's alive   wha   alive alive   it has a functioning power source   sleepy's reading radionuclides   but they don't match any known isotope   i get temporal matches  but even then  they seem to shift   is that even possible   depends on the shifting of the temporal radio stuff  so     it's totally weird  right   i'm gonna go check on coulson   we've got company   national police   what  why are they here   they heard about this object   they're probably here to protect it   this area has lots of rebel uprisings   yeah  people are fighting back  against the government's mining policies   it's pretty kick ass   yeah  it's kick ass  all the violence   that's not what i'm saying   no  it's what you're typing   in your van  alone    where it's safe   how much longer   what's the hurry  are we in danger   not if everyone does their job   what is yours  exactly   the cacao is from a secret valley in peru   very special   the best chocolate in the world   could use some sugar    americans   you know me  camilla  i'm a pretty simple guy   there was nothing simple about your last mission here   i had some great help   there isn't any chance we get to keep the device  is there   it's not mine to give   but i'm sure we can find a way to resolve this respectfully  in a way that gives your coun    rebels  stay close  on my six       let's go   they're coming for it  let's move   no  no  no  no  no  no   it doesn't matter  it does to me   please  let us do this   we need a containment case for the 0 8 4   there's no time   but it has a fluctuating power core     frequencies way above    sorry  science class is over    whoa   whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  wait   you did not just pull that out of the wall   what is the matter with you    do you realize we do not know the amount of photon emissions  coming out of this    okay   we don't know what will happen if it gets excited   stay close  simmons  fitz  come on       come one     your men need to fall back now  or we'll never make the runway   now    your truck  let's go    get back   tell your men to get down     watch out      get in  get in   move  now   yes  yeah  that's a good idea   after you  after you     coulson's secure in pmp's truck   take the south route to the airfield  gotcha   slow down   you're joking  right   ward  listen  we have to be careful   there's a binding energy structure that could overheat   i could roll down a window    aah   do not roll down a window   stay quiet and keep your heads down   head left  the ravine empties   but  ward   both  quiet     how fast can you have the wheels up   fast     ramp   on it   what are you doing   coulson is still out there   get off the ramp  you're in the line of fire     ward  cut it pretty close  sir   didn't want to leave anyone behind   i got to say it  i miss my van   now  what was the problem   as i said before   this device has a high frequency  fluctuating   sub material compression     fitz  in english   the 0 8 4 is fueled by tesseract technology   hydra  world war ii  captain america   it's full of lethal amounts of gamma radiation   gamma    you're saying it's nuclear   coulson  no   he's saying it's much  much worse   h q   and the 0 8 4 is in your possession   it's on board and contains a tesseract fuel cell   so   there's that   copy   you are a go for check in guidance  through restricted airspace   safe travels     top speed's a priority  may   obviously   i know you didn't want to see combat   i apologize for that   do you need anything else  before i go check on the device fueled by evil  that's sitting in our cargo hold   this was fun   not to worry  the device is stable   not that it couldn't explode at any minute   especially if hit with machine gun fire   but things like this happen from time to time  when in the field  and at first  it's very unpleasant   and you regret your decision to leave the lab at all    fitz  are you mental   i did explain in great detail  exactly what i meant   using the queen's bloody english   i use normal english     words like  duck  and  run  and  might blow us to pieces    oh  oh  well  congratulations  agent ward   you managed to string three words together  in a sentence   is everyone all right   banged up but alive   thank you for the extraction   reyes  but we lost a lot of men   we'll make sure the rest of you get home safe   are we safe  on a plane with that   there's a pmp airfield in iquitos   it's a short distance    we'll burn as fast as we can  for a s h i e l d  containment facility   there's no safer place for us to go   sir  if i may   you got anything to drink around here   upstairs   i think you'll find it quite comfortable up there   i expect the grand tour   i know you do   fitz  i'm trying to tell you     ward     don't understand anything you are saying   do we have a problem in here   no  sir   just working on our communication   not everyone was prepared for a firefight   we got out  didn't lose anyone   saved a few of theirs     i'd say we did all right   anything else   uh  yeah  i have a small question   because i've been feeling like the tagalong hayseed rookie   but now i get the sense that ward doesn't know  which one's simmons and which one's fitz   and they've seen even less gunfire than me   and i'm no rocket scientist   but is this your first mission together   no  of course not   it's our second   i was your first  that's sweet   ward  you're amused   i'm terrified   i am in way over my head   but i have been on this team just as long as any of you   i might as well be team captain    i was joking  but maybe that's not a bad idea   because these guys do not like each other much   ward  this isn't about that   i'm a specialist   today  i could have eliminated the enemy threat myself  if i was working alone   but i had non combat ready agents     whoa  whoa  wait  you work alone   so typical  who do you think designs your equipment   or the polymers for your weaponry  yeah     people like us do it    try going into  the field with just your bare bum   see them proving the point i just made   you're not wrong   we still need to iron out the kinks   but  ward  you can speak six languages   simmons  you have two phds in fields i can't pronounce   and  fitz  you are a rocket scientist   so work it out   i i'm    i'm good at stuff  too          so  should we work or just continue to     i'm saying i said there would come a moment  when we would regret the decision to go in the field   i didn't think that would happen in week one    oh  god   this seam in the sedimentary layers  suggests some sort of molten cave in  a few decades back   yeah  well  this here    it's optical amplification   now  i think    well  i'm most likely dead on     that the tesseratic energy excites plasma  with an inverse population of energy levels   a laser   a ray of   pure energy    two terajoules   see the ampliphier   we're lucky the drones didn't trigger it  while we were taking electromagnetic readings   this is a weapon  powerful enough to     enough to melt through 50 feet of solid rock to bury itself   imagine what it could do to a person   yeah  or an airplane   for example    hunger games     matterhorn    one of a hundred books my s o  gave me  that i'm just getting around to   s o     supervising officer   got it   hackers have lingo  too  but i'll pick yours up   i feel like you and me    wrong foot   can i   buy you a drink     what i said before    when i said the uprising was     whatever i said    a good thing   i don't want you to think i'm oblivious   what i was talking about was the tweets   tweets   you trying to make things better or worse   peruvians have organized for the first time in decades   thousands of suffering people who have never met  uniting over a common idea   it's mind blowing   and i don't want to bring it up  because i don't want to see your hate face   but   that's what the rising tide is all about   okay   usually  one person doesn't have the solution   but 100 people with 1  of the solution     that'll get it done   i think that's beautiful     pieces solving a puzzle   you and i see the world differently is all   i've never been in a war zone during a war until today   that was crazy   i take it you've seen that a lot     wh   did you get shot   skin deep  nothing to worry about   you got shot   did that happen protecting us   said don't worry about it   well  no wonder you were so pissed   i wasn't pissed   i was trained to be the whole solution     to eliminate variables   and today  they keep adding up   we're turning   we've entered restricted airspace   so we have to follow certain flight paths     regulation   this plane is capable of fully automated flight   but may has to be on the stick herself tonight   you've got an s o  may's got to be on the stick   lots of good lingo on this plane   yeah   we just can't seem to understand each other   first walkie talkie wristwatch      they only made 20  i think   still works   i forgot you're such a sentimentalist  phillip    romanticizing history   yeah  most of it's glued down   there was an elegance to things back then   there we agree   with everything around us changing so quickly   it doesn't hurt to have a few touchstones to the past   reminds me what's important   the last thing i want to do is relive days gone by   a few nights  maybe     i see what you're doing   i'm reminiscing   this plane is such a step up  from the r v  we used to work out of  when you were stationed in cusco   i don't remember much working     i also don't remember you being this direct   skye  hand me the bottle   okay  turbo   but you're still nursing the one you got   i'm not the only one   we're stuck above the clouds for the next few hours   we might as well enjoy ourselves   we could make a few more memories  to add to your collection   what do you think   i think     ward already knows  you'll have to eliminate may from the equation  to have a chance     which gives him about 20 seconds to get to her first   aah         we were allies   we had history   when did you decide to throw that away   as soon as i saw your team   the reason i'm still alive is because you need me to verify  the change of routes for your pilot  when h q  calls in any minute now   i'd appreciate that  but if i don't   s h i e l d  will shoot this aircraft out of the sky   that'll take the 0 8 4 out of your hands   maybe i should let them   oh  no  i think you'll make the calls   you already handed me your plane  for the life of one of your little lab rats   if i open the cargo hold  you'll lose them all   and you are such a sentimentalist   fitz  this is my fault   should have learned kung fu   simmons  oh  yeah  but i shouldn't have  pushed you into the field in the first place   you weren't ready   it was my job to make a proper threat assessment   uh  we    we weren't ready   this wouldn't have happened if agent may wasn't on the stick   she would have busted out some of her ninja know how   agent may  no  no  no   she transferred from administration   well  i've seen her destroy a guy  so     you've heard of the cavalry   yeah  yeah   wh   everyone at the academy talks about st    both  she's the cavalry   i told you never to call me that   i can't believe it   oh  we're sure to get out of here now   um  how do we get out of here     can't go through the doors   they're bolted  tied to the pressurization lines   you two geniuses have nothing   yeah  well  it's hard to concentrate  in these intense situations   hey  don't freeze up   take a breath   you don't need to come up  with the whole solution   just part of it  right   yeah   pieces solving a puzzle   coulson  you knew this was a weapon all along   reyes  but you got to it first   i had to play nice   yes  coulson  for once  i'm actually ahead of you   my country commissioned that weapon decades ago   after the fall of hydra   many scientists followed their nazi friends  to hide on this side of the world   german engineering   the weapon was lost during a clash in the jungle  until today   with it  we'll end the rebel uprising  and finally stabilize my country   you mean rule your country   you stay in your borders  i'll stay in mine   those borders are disappearing   aliens descended on new york  remember   they don't care whose colors you wear   they just care who's in the way   we should be working together   not fighting   well  that's clearly the worst idea we've heard yet   but it could work   reyes is gonna kill us the minute we land  regardless   and blame it on rebels   this way  we have a fighting chance   i'll take it   what's first   we can't get upstairs without going in the lab   and the only way to release the lab doors is from upstairs   the first thing is  we're tied to the cargo door   so unless you can      what the hell was that   her wrist   aah     what's next   was it 11 years ago  now   you swooped in with s h i e l d  with so much confidence   so much mystery   you had 100 men at your disposal   and now    a hand picked team   and  yes  they're that good   oh  phil  you're not even aware   your renewed idealism  your collectibles   your airborne man cave   surrounding yourself with young  attractive agents     you're having a mid life crisis   more an afterlife thing  really   and i'm not going to even mention  the red corvette   her name's lola    of course it is   it's textbook   you built this team so you could feel relevant   to feel needed   they don't need me   they need time   well  time is not on their side   no  but you gave them something better     a common enemy   okay  we're sure  right  everyone's sure   we're all on board  yeah  let's do this fast   no turning back  no freezing up   because if we do  then     all of us die  we know   all right     you guys talk a lot     no  no  no       h q   s h i e l d  6 1 6  we have radar contact   requesting confirmation on a change in course  over     answer it  or they all learn  what a 30 000 foot drop feels like   agent coulson  are you there   you have course confirmation   you are cleared direct to the slingshot   agent coulson   everything all right up there   we heard you had a little dustup on the ground   yeah  we're all good   it's gonna be blue skies from here on out   simmons  forget what i said before   this is the moment that we'll regret       aah   aaaaah   skye  it worked   the drop in cabin pressure released the doors   i'll take care of the soldiers   you guys get to the 0 8 4   and coulson   let's hope he can handle himself    aah   aah     get back   go now  find the 0 8 4     help   coulson  got you   camilla  hold on   it's okay   i've got it   fitz  reel us back in   fitz  i've got you     we need your help   trust me   don't want you to know  what a 30 000 foot drop feels like   aah       cut him loose   sorry  sorry   ward  hold on     aah   i read the safety pamphlet   i think you might be the first   no other way in  huh   was just starting to warm up to this place   the 0 8 4 is cooling and stable   but we should call h q  and get it to the slingshot  as soon as possible   told you they were good     not a scratch  but your plane's totaled   i hope s h i e l d  insurance covers hijackings   sure  under  incidentals      what exactly am i signing up for   like i said     front row seat to the craziest show on earth   yeah  but i didn't expect  the show to get this crazy this fast  all for an object you're just gonna destroy   slingshot is protocol   a weapon like the 0 8 4 is too dangerous  for any person or country to have   people like reyes would always be after it   what happened with reyes  anyway   she's being held  at a s h i e l d  detainment facility   i expect the peruvian government will negotiate for her release   she probably won't spend much time in jail   no  i mean what happened with you and reyes   you guys totally did it back in the day  right   that's classified     looks like skye might end up as more than just a consultant   despite our reservations   she could turn into a solid asset     with some serious work   well  if she wants to be a field agent   she'll need a supervising officer     someone disciplined  someone good   all right   i'll do it   just to clarify  you were  uh  talking about me  right   fitz  we blew up a plane   i had a new experience   eat that  professor vaughn   you had a new experience   but it was new for all of us   may  they're happy   hey  come on  you guys don't want to miss this   fitz  so  it'll take about 180 days to reach the sun   now  yes  of course  it would have been faster  if they'd used hydrogen fueled apus  but they're having fun   how many of those have you guys had    sk    skye   it's important when in the field  to unwind from time to time   yeah  yeah  especially after a hard day  of everyone almost dying   which doesn't happen every day  right   it's an anomaly    an irregularity   not   the norm   speaking of  not the norm   whose idea was it  to blow a hole in the plane   may said that the doors  were tied to the pressurization  so i thought     so we thought it was the only way to release them   it was everyone's idea  sir   yes  quite genius  really   nice work   man  all clear for liftoff   fitz  oh  time for blastoff    launching     in three         two     the trajectory will take it beyond the lagrange point  so that it doesn't hit herschel   and there haven't been any coronal mass ejections   so it shouldn't lose telemetry   ward  guys  english   ow     _  fury  really  really  coulson   six days   it only took you six days to take a completely renovated  piece of state of the art machinery  and turn it into scrap    my team acted with my authority   don't talk to me about authority   do you know how much this plane cost   it's got a bar   a really nice one   talking to me about authority   you know  i have the authority  to downgrade your ass to a winnebago   i'm aware of that  sir   well  i want it fixed just like you found it   so don't have fitz simmons going making modifications   like a a a a    damn fish tank   yes  sir   and the new girl     she's a risk   i know  sir   you know  sir   how's lola   she's fine  sir   thanks for asking   talking to me about authority   yeah  we're gonna have to kill the fish tank   sync   corrections by honeybunny
