mr  lattimer   welcome to warehouse 13     i'm thrilled you're on the team    what team  what is this place   officially  k 39 triple z on the north american grid   but     i like to think of it as america's attic   projet sg   pete  close the door   tell me exactly what i'm doing here   exactly  that's a little dif     well  to put it plainly   you're both joining me as fellow gatherers and protectors of secrets   put it plainer   this    this warehouse     look  the warehouse needs you  it needs    pete  don't touch   it needs your combined talents  he's intuitive  and you're     you've got a scrupulous eye for detail  he's scattershot  and you're meticulous   you look  he leaps   there's been a mistake  i'm too valuable to be wasted here   no offense     of course not    can i use your phone  please   mine   it's broken     i have to make a phone call  so      there's no signal here   yeah  you're    you're    just pull    pull the door  and you'll be    now   there you go   i think she had other plans   so did i   you want juice or are you a milk person     you know what i'd really like    i do indeed  but falling off the wagon  may not be the best option at this point     milk it is    yeah     that's mrs  frederic    long time ago     she looks exactly the same    odd  isn't it   you don't want a cookie     so who are these guys    former colleagues   and where are they now   this one and this one are dead   this one  a mental institution in germany  and this last one     disappeared  one day i'll find him   ted  these are two of my best agents  how can you not know   i'm looking at the order  you processed it  how can't you know   hold on     dickinson    sir  it's myka bering   sir  i have a little situation here  i'm not sure     yeah  yeah  you know what  i'm looking at the transfer order   the name on here is frederic  you're transferred to where     where are you    i'm in south dakota     where    south dakota     what are you doing in south dakota    you don't know about this   no  who is frederic   sir   sir     who's this frederic    sir  yes  yes   she handed me orders last night  to come here to a warehouse in south dakota   the order code was solid  and lattimer's here too   look  i'm requesting an immediate stand down and transfer back to dc   myka  myka  i can't do that  okay  this order trumps me   let me get on this  i'll get you back here asap     what should i do    follow orders     those orders  both of you    and how long will this take   sir  sir  are you still there   that's a pile of crap     no kidding    no  i'm not kidding   you're actually standing in a big pile of cow manure     oatmeal scotchie    no  thank you   i don't eat sugar   good for you   listen     please don't think of this assignment  you know  as some sort of punishment     can you hold this    what   you know  yeah  your presence here is not really  a reaction to what happened to you in denver   so     i got a commendation for what happened in denver   yes  you did  it's time for the nickel tour  come on   the order trumps dickinson   the first warehouse 13 was built in '98     so we're stuck    until he works out a transfer  yes    we didn't have a handle on how to store stuff  it burned down   some remodeling and excavations were necessary as the years went on  to accommodate the arrival of more and more and more and more artifacts   what's stored here  exactly   this and that  bric a brac   some things along the lines of     last night's rock and roll  i'm talking about the blood stone   both hands     on the bar  please   i think i'll survive a crash   no  that's not a safety bar  it's a conduit   you and pete are the power source   your combined electrical energy makes this thing move   it's fine  it's fine   look  thomas edison built this automobile for henry ford  as a proof of concept  and it's perfectly safe   trust me   put your hands on the bar  put your hands on the bar   thank you   we need both of you   hands on the bar  myka  thank you   edison   he wanted ford to let go of oil  but ford  no  no  he stuck with it  because it ruined his engines faster  people had to keep buying them     what is that    what   that is training flight 22   we pulled that from the bermuda triangle   the triangle's been trying to pull it back ever since   duck and cover   it's harmless   the inventory kicks up a little static from time to time   why are you grinning   well  don't you think this stuff is kind of cool   i mean       where is he    i don't know   he'll be back     hello    we should stick together   right this way  please   many of the items in here  kind of like the blood stone  pete   that you wrestled with last night  the channel of tangential energy     well  tangential energy is kind of like the energy that forced  the museum employee  last night  into     well  into almost committing murder     so how does that happen    we're not really exactly sure how   it goes back to einstein  and e equals     yeah  okay  somehow     the matter that is in here has just enough energy to move other matter   you know  like you     move me where    into trouble   bunk   is gravity bunk  magnetism   these are mysterious forces that we live with  but we can't explain 'em   can you even explain to me how a radio works   and you don't care  as long as you get the traffic report   but if a radio landed in the hands of thomas jefferson   you know what jefferson would do  he would just lock it up  until he figured out it wasn't gonna kill him  and that is exactly     what we do here  we take the unexplained     and we just safely  tuck it away  in this super sized pandora's box     metaphorically speaking    pandora's box is over in aisle 989b   empty  of course   do the world a favor and clear your mind   well  that should be easy   how did that get there  'cause i didn't pick that thing up   it still amazes me how that thing moves   what  what is it   don't talk  don't hope  don't wish for anything     that kettle grants wishes    yes  now pete  look at me   just keep your eyes on me   open it   pete  pete  this     this is a neutralizer   you can think of this as a fire extinguisher for objects that act up   now look  i want you to come over here and drop that slowly  right in here   there are items around here  if you were to put it in there   they would generate a flash  but this will be a little spark   but you may flinch  and i don't want to  'cause you could drop it  okay     well  i have a wish    don't     you wished for a ferret    no     that was already in the thing    i don't think so   you wished for a transfer  didn't you   impossible wishes  wishes that can never be granted   they produce a ferret   don't ask me why   my first year here  the whole place was crawling with ferrets     i swear  i didn't pick that thing up    no  i know  i know   not everybody is affected by everything  here  okay   you have to be metaphysically predisposed   and the external energies  they have to be in alignment     this is just a convergence thing    right  sure  okay   so we're    we're all converged here   but i still have no idea what i'm supposed to do   what you're supposed to do  is hunt down whatever is threatening  to ruin the world's day  neutralize it and bring it here   you gotta snag it and bag it and tag it   this is crazy  this is crazy   you know  i don't    it could be  you know  crazy fun   that's the attitude that brought you to our attention   do you guys want a cookie for the road   what road   there's rooms for you at leena's bed and breakfast   it's about 7 miles down the road that way  and i'll join you there  in the morning and i'll tou    i'll just join you there in the morning   stay close   seriously  lattimer  there's been a serious screw up   i'm serious   and now you have a ferret   what   this town    is this a town or what     what's the name of it    well  it's more like a street   so it says here to turn left  at buffalo station   what  no  no  no  it's  buffalo statue    well  your penmanship is atrocious   i don't need wise    you know  that's    you know  don't do that   can you finish a sentence   a full thought   would you really like me to   wait  no  no  no  don't    don't call dickinson     he hates being pestered    i don't pester   when he knows something  he'll call   clearly the phrase  rolling with the punches   is not in your vocabulary  so may i make a suggestion   what might that be   unbunch your panties     and make the best of a bad situation   and how do i do that   which part   you're a freak   hello   i'm leena   you must be pete and myka   come in  i've got your rooms ready   we serve three meals   we've got radios in the rooms  no tvs   no in room phones  but there is one there  at the bottom of the stairs in the hallway   you may choose any room   is there anywhere i can get a drink  i mean  a drink    drink     what would you like    whiskey neat     i can do that    please do that   she hates traveling   she loves traveling   it's the places she's traveled to that's the problem     can i get you anything    no  i'm fine   just       is everything okay    you're a lucky man  pete   i am   you're in tune   very rare   i don't know what that mea    look     are you    are you connected to artie   let me know if your bed is big enough for you   hey  buddy     how'd it go today    not bad   lattimer seems interested   and ms  bering  not so much   did you select a case for them   i don't mean any disrespect  but are we really sure they're the right people   because     i'm fully aware of their baggage   now what's the real problem   artie  take yourself off the hook   their fate falls on me   you say that     dickinson wants them back  you've got to get them locked in   can't sleep   yeah  me neither   we don't have to talk   so       do you always eat when stressed    do you always talk this much   you know  no light from the city to get in the way   nothing but sky   this time of the year  we get leo   cygnus  sagittarius   you know this how   my dad and i used to camp a lot   where is he now   sorry   what about your folks   colorado springs   they own a bookstore called bering and sons     how many brothers    no brothers  just me   my dad thought the  and sons  sounded classier   he must be proud of you   mom is   well  did protecting  the president of the united states turn him around   this won't   from denver to dc  to a warehouse security guard in six months   now there's a career trajectory   look  about denver   i didn't mean to spit on that last night   what you did there was better than textbook   we're not discussing that   ever   all right  well  i'm gonna     go back upstairs     and not sleep some more   earlier  did you hear a     hear what   never mind   dickinson will call   he better   rotation  time   seever city   come on   so it's gonna be you  then   cody thomas   a law school grad student  at the university of southern iowa     iowa    yeah  iowa   his parents were killed in a plane crash   he is a really good kid  putting himself through college with the settlement   why are we going to iowa   to find whatever it is that pushed this kid over the edge     what edge    he struck his girlfriend   that's it   so far   for the past five days  i have been reviewing 11 possible cases   looking for whatever doesn't fit  something out of place   like blood on a marble floor that leads to a man with a knife   because of a rock that isn't just a rock   i've got a hunch that this is the one   what exactly are we looking for   well  you tell me   it's bigger than a breadbox     or smaller   if there is an artifact at the heart of this   then i've prepared a few questions for cody that might reveal it   actually  it's  more than a few questions  but      do you have the constant feeling that today is yesterday    if they say yes  then we could     they probably won't say yes  it's unlikely     we could be dealing with time slip    or a hangover   please take this seriously   i had a run in with a mayan calendar few years ago  that question saved my life   and the two agents that were with me were not quite so lucky   what happened to them   their clocks     stopped   so  what  they died   they'll wish they had in 100 years or so  anyway     neutralizer   the purple stuff   if you find the artifact   just drown it in there   like this   if you can   and if it's too big  you just take this and throw it  and then call me   and don't ask me how it works  because i have no idea   and it doesn't always work   and don't ingest that stuff  because you'll     see things   and we'll stay in contact with these  i have one just like it     two way video communication    i call it a farnsworth   named after philo farnsworth   who invented that in 1929  right after he invented the television   isn't that remarkable  i mean  anyway   if you wanna talk to me  just press that button   what is that   nicola tesla   thomas edison's chief rival or nemesis  depending   he cooked this up  as an alternative to bullets  it's a     it's really     a kind of electric stun gun   a polyphase ass kicker   now  that's     just here  just don't put it past two to begin with   that's the trigger  right there   you should practice with it first  one blast and down you go   don't point that at me  keep your finger away   just don't   give him the gun   and also  it zaps short term memory   which is why agent morris doesn't remember seeing me at the museum   and that's it   that's what   go to iowa  talk to cody   find the artifact  if it exists  neutralize it and bring it back   don't get killed     how's her aura    tortured   guilt and grief  mostly   she has a soft spot for the ferret  just like you   now that was a long time ago   you haven't changed that much   she had a stowaway  i found this in her room   oh  lord  that's houdini's wallet   fingers   that was a bad spike  that landed on something with her   i requisitioned mesh screens for those shelves ten years ago   and every year since     i've told you this    a few times   you'd think mrs  frederic could maybe get that done   don't look at me   well  i had the fbi in here a while ago on a suspected terrorist thing   all egos out to here and all looking like they're wearing daddy's suit   well  we feel the same way   let me know if the thing's going federal so i can prepare my staff for the media   it's not going federal  we just have a few questions and then we're gone   it's dickinson     just a sec    yeah  this is bering     how you doing    we're in iowa now  on assignment     any luck in getting us back    the bad news is not so far   the good news is  i've got a line on this frederic woman   she worked for the treasury department in the 1950s  and after     well  it's not the same woman  the woman we met was younger   i've got a frederic in charge of some sort of secret sandbox   funded from a black ops budget i'm still trying to source   i can fill you in   these lines aren't secure   listen to me  i'm doing everything i can to get you and pete back here    so just follow your current orders and keep your head down   wait  sir   sir   so how'd he sound      yeah  but how'd he sound    not good     what kind of questions    they're sort of diagnostic   diagnostic  like i'm sick   you're secret service doctors   question number one    have you recently encountered something that you feel has affected your life    something like     an object of some kind   do handcuffs count   question number two   while looking up  do you have the sensation of falling    i don't feel like i'm falling     next question    okay  question number three    have you recently smelled something that could best be described     as fudge when there is no fudge     fudge  is that     question four    do you have ever feel like this might be a colossal waste of time    okay  so     we're done with those questions     what do you think happened with your girlfriend     what's her name    i don't know   emily   i don't know   i don't remember   i was in class  talking to the professor about some mock trial thing   i woke up here  and they told me i beat emily up     have they let you see a doctor    yeah     says i'm fine    and no       no alcohol or drugs    no  i swear   no history of blackouts   this isn't me   i would never hurt emily  this isn't me  this isn't     se li uomini sapessino le cagioni  della paura mia  capir potrebbero il mio dolor   get him out of here   let's get him down to secure lockup   well  that was scary   can you come this way  son   hello  i'm lorna soliday  i'm cody's lawyer   and did travis call you   sheriff travis respects the law   and he doesn't like being railroaded by federal agents   are you that hands on with all your clients     just my godson    so you knew his parents   very well   and neither cody nor i will be answering any more questions    until i know what this is about    we're interested in cody's behavior     his violent behavior    as in  where's it coming from   what is this  someone pegged him as a threat to the president   not yet   not ever  that's not cody   it was cody that just destroyed that table   not to mention what he did to his girlfriend   does the secret service investigate every case    of battery among college students    nope  just this one     so where'd the italian come in    what do you mean   he spoke italian in there  just before he decided    that the interview was over    i don't know anything about that   well  has cody come into contact  with anything unusual  say  in the past few days     yes  you two    that was a serious question   that was a serious answer   any more questions  sheriff travis has my number   you felt that  right   i'm not sure what you mean   it got hot   but you knew to get me to the floor before he freaked out   the vibe   right   okay  so how do those things work   is there false alarms or       it happens all the time    so why do you trust them   one time i didn't  and i should have   you're right  it's italian  sort of   i mean  this is either  part gibberish  i don't know  it's some kind of code  maybe   and my software can barely translate any of this and says  dolor   means  pain    and a text search came up with nothing   there's no films  no books  no plays  no songs  no poems   so what now   you're right beside a college campus   you can go find somebody who speaks italian   excuse me   professor marzotto   we're with the secret service   oh  my   it's an old construction    it's not working class italian either   this is high brow     so what's he saying    roughly    if people knew   the reasons for my fear    they'd be able to understand my pain    do you visit italy a lot   i haven't been back in nearly two years   but you're sure this translation is correct   i'm a renaissance scholar  i'm sure   one last question   do you know a student here named cody thomas   i know of him   i read about him in the paper  it's a sad story     how so    well

not be hearing   same thing you heard at leena's   look  sometimes we    we hear things    and see things that aren't there    what i heard can't be there     it can't be    then it's not   i mean  maybe it's post traumatic stress   i read the press release of what went down in denver     lives were saved    lives were lost   you're a hero   you're gonna put me on a psych eval  aren't you   why would i do that   because you need to be able to depend on your partner   all right  well  then you're just gonna have  to depend on me to know that you're okay   we're gonna finish this case  we're gonna get out of here  we will   i don't know if i can   i don't even know what we're looking for   yes  you do   i mean  whatever doesn't fit   you know  something that's out of place   marzotto lied to us  he said that the last time    he was in italy was      two years ago   yeah  my contact told me it was eight weeks ago   how'bout that   i wonder what else he lied about     i guess we need more information    yes  we do     cody's girlfriend    emily krueger   i need a picture   just give me a picture   give me a picture   don't make me come down there   all right   i know this is     awkward   and i feel terrible  but     you can't keep it   i don't know what i was thinking even taking it out of italy   but it has to go back   i'm going to rome next week   and that's coming with me   what's that for   i hate this part     emily  you're late    sorry   we were setting up for the party   can i help you   emily krueger   i know your pain  trust me   we saw you leaving professor marzotto's office  didn't we   oh  right   i was there for a meeting   for the play   i'm in it  marzotto's sort of a technical advisor   does he know about your relationship with cody   he knows what happened  why   because when we talked to him about cody  he didn't mention you   or that you'd just been to see him   maybe he was trying to protect my privacy     why did you guys mention cody    we needed something translated   yeah  have you ever heard cody speak italian   just once   when he did this     how long have you known cody    since the eighth grade   got serious after his parents died   i came here for theater   he applied for law school   his godmother helped him get in     lorna soliday    you met her     does she have any family    just cody   and that's not even real family   she made sure that he got that big settlement when his parents died   do you know what it means    if people knew the reasons for my fear    they would be able to understand my pain      does that mean anything to you    only that he's afraid of abandonment   it scares him   maybe he thought that i was spending too much time on the play   i don't know  can i go back to work now   ten to one this has nothing to do with the hocus pocus artie's pushing   how'bout a billion to one  how about a cute girl  in a play by machiavelli makes her insecure boyfriend freak out   or    or try this  emily  an actress  is a ruthless gold digger   she'd know which buttons to push on her insecure boyfriend  to get him made enough to hit her  she goes for the money   sues him for it   what kind of women do you date     it's marzotto    what   the attendant said he heard him speaking italian before he doused himself   hold on   why'd you talk to marzotto   who told you that   secret service hits campus  and people notice  and now he's dead   before this  you said something to make cody want to knock your heads off     something you want to tell me    we should talk later     let me tell you something      sure   something that makes it seem  like i couldn't kick your ass in front of your men   boys  can we put our badges back in our pants  please   sheriff   what was that     we gotta get to marzotto's office    and how are we gonna get in   hotshot   what the hell  is warehouse 13   we haven't met  i'm mrs  frederic     how'd you get in here    through a door   warehouse 13  is it yours   it's mine   and so are lattimer and bering   excuse me   can i ask you something   shoot   never mind   the vibe thing   my dad was a     fireman   when i was 12   i got this feeling one morning that i was never gonna see him again   and you didn't say anything   i didn't want him to see how scared i was   he died that night in a house fire  saving a couple of kids   i'm sorry   me too   so now when you get a feeling       he got his pen out of his pencil cup    at least he died happy   that's not funny   you're right   that's strange   what   the  m s are out of order   there's something in there     is this it    i don't know     well  what if it is    then we're done     so open it    you open it   i don't want another ferret or whatever     se li uomini      don't   just in case     what's that    something's missing   let's call artie   miss soliday     what are you doing here    you heard what happened to marzotto   yes  sheriff travis just called   now get out before i call him back  and tell him you're searching this office without a warrant   we're here investigating his suicide   ed didn't kill himself     he had help    what do you mean   somebody broke his heart   we were together for three years   and then we weren't   i thought we were in love   but things change  and he chose someone else   a student   did emily krueger break his heart   and cody's   she's a despicable young woman who uses people to get what she wants   and then when she's done using them     we're looking for something  something about this big   we think marzotto had it  but now it's missing   did emily get it  you know  whatever it is   why don't you ask her   she's helping with the party for the play   cody's there     cody's out    emily dropped the charges     okay  we should go    i'm coming with you   if you're confronting emily  i need to be there for cody   let's go   i gotta lose weight   do you think emily would ever hurt cody   not physically   even if she tried  she couldn't   and why not   me   cody has me   i made a promise to his parents when i became his godmother  that i would always be there  to protect him   it's only a matter of time before cody realizes  emily's just small town trash   cody is destined for great things   and i'm helping him succeed   with me  he can do anything or be anyone he wants   could you pull over for a sec   i know you   well  that's a good sign   where am i   hospital   in iowa   seever city   what happened   car accident   you've been out for two days   how's pete   lattimer's still unconscious

 i'm fine   i'm fine   just    here  answer that   you're looking for jewelry  this  this thing   yeah  we know  we just saw it in a woman's hair     she tried to kill us    a woman  what woman   her name is lorna soliday  she's     part of the ruling class  single  successful  middle aged   she's a survivor of family tragedies and the death of loved ones   she's connected somehow to a young man  that she believes needs her protection   he's good  yeah   what's the matter with you two   okay  anyway  look  this comb is transmitting lucretia borgia     lucretia who    borgia   she's a cutthroat italian who ruled italy  in the 1600s with her father and brothers   my family owned a book store  remember   that's right   so what do you mean the comb's transmitting   an alchemist made it  okay   out of what  i don't know   it's supposed to be some kind of renaissance roofie   somehow the crystals in the ionized metal are affecting brain chemistry     what about the phrase    yeah  the phrase   that's like some kind of phonetic trigger   this is a very  very  very unhappy woman   very unlucky in love     there's supposed to be a jewelry box    we found it in marzotto's office   he must have given soliday the comb   like her  she wants love at any cost   she wants love  and she is gonna kill to get it   she wants    she wants cody  so she wants emily gone   and emily's at the party   what are you talking about a party  what party   god   some renaissance blowout  for some machiavelli play   machia    this woman's gonna be there  you've gotta stop this woman   lucretia borgia  600 years ago  started a bloody reign of terror   and this comb is gonna wanna start it all over again   it's got twisted desires  and it'll amplify   it'll spread like some kind of orgiastic virus   first to iowa  then to nebraska  then to illinois   we understand   probably first to illinois and then     okay  look  we need to get you to a hospital first and     no  look  i'm trained to take a bullet  if necessary   but     i'm not sure how to stop a dead italian cougar    we need some kind of approach   well  i have no more color coded plans   there's a silver lining   okay  i'll go in  grab cody     you flank    no  you flank   trust me   that's not creepy   how you doing   that's nice   come on  man  you don't wanna do this   look   you don't wanna hurt her   just let emily go   he intends to   her dying scream will be the trigger     look  nobody's screaming  okay   we're gonna take a deep breath  and we're all gonna come back down to earth   cute   kid's fast   what's your pain  lorna   what are you afraid of   you know   and so does she   show's over   drop the comb    thing   did you really let your lover die     shut up    for a chance at glory   i said shut up   don't look at it  myka   yeah  sorry   no one's dying here tonight   but you might lose a tooth   duck and cover     what did i do    it's okay  it's over   love hurts  i know   so here's the deal  you got a choice   you can come back to dc  or you can stay with the new assignment     what's the catch    i only get you   lattimer has to stay there     and if i stay  what happens to pete    he still stays     how long do i have to think about it    about five more seconds   four  three  two
