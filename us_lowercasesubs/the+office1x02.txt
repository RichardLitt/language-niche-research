unconditional trust  it's nice   mutual  likewise  reciprocated   my only worry is that the powers that be don't come down here   pop their head round the door with their rule book   and go   oh  hold on  what's going on here    these people are mucking around    whilst getting the job done  they're having a laugh at work  with the sword of damocles hanging over them    this isn't in the rule book

coming in   now  you know what this is about  obviously you've seen the picture     david on the computer      i saw it   yeah  and we've all had a bit of a laugh about it     it was funny    yeah   there's a time when the joking has to stop   not only is it derogatory     david has trusted me with this because     not only have i got people skills   but i am trained in covert operations   you know the phrase  softly softly catchee monkey    i could catch a monkey  if i was starving  i could   i would make poison darts out of the poison off deadly frogs   on milligram of that poison can kill a monkey  or a man   prick yourself  you'd be dead within a day   or longer   different frogs  different times   do you know who done the picture   yup   no  i mean  no   right  your first answer was yeah     wasn't it    i meant no     well  why did you get       i er    don't know   am i making you nervous   no  i mean  yeah   hmm  that's interesting   i've just spent two days in swindon with neil  and he's made some big changes   now  when we spoke on friday   you said you were going to instigate some changes  how is that going     great    good  what have you done   changed many things  really   in a global sense  streamlining   the whole ongoing enterprise of it   i'm sorry  david  that sounds like management speak  you hate that   yeah  i do  so     well  can you give me  say  five practical changes that you've made     five changes    mmm   i'll give you three  then another two if you need them   ok   efficiency  turnover  profitability   that still sounds like management speak     no  because      you hate that     shall i tell you what neil's done    can do   he's frozen any wage increases   he's put a stop on all overtime   and any purchases of  100 or more now go through him    100  i was going to make it 90  but  100 is all right   and he has started making redundancies  david     that's only four    yeah  whatever   have you made any redundancies   i gave a speech only this morning to my staff   assuring them there would be no cutbacks  and certainly no redundancies     why on earth would you do that    why  don't know   a word that i think's important in management called morale   well  it's going to be worse for morale in the long run  when there are redundancies and you've told people there won't be   they won't remember   with your arms       ah    and then     that way  ooh   yeah  i know  like a     yeah   david  there have got to be cutbacks   if you can't do that yourself  i'm your boss  i can do that for you   you're not the boss here  and i've already made cutbacks     you've made cutbacks already    yeah   i didn't want to tell the staff  but you     cutbacks where   staff   so there have been redundancies   yeah     have you let anyone go    yeah   who   julie   where does julie work   warehouse   what does she do   she's a general warehouse    in the warehouse  she was  so     i thought i knew everyone in the warehouse  what's her surname   second name   anderton   um    it's signs that gareth's made for the door of his office   he started off with  interrogation room    he went to  interrogation office     investigation room       investigation office   just for     he really lost it here    quiet please  invetigation in process     silence  interrogation   that's frightening   that's the one he's gone for   investigation and meeting room    makes sense  my personal favourite has to be      gareth keenan investigates    so     there's a lot of um       i'm trying to work in here    sorry  mate     how is the  invetigation  going    good   very good   do you need a deputy at all   no  i've already got one   all right  sheila   keep it down   this is scary  david   don't tie any more cash up in stock unless you have to   i'm sure you could lose more people from down here  who's the foreman   taffy   taffy     glynn    what   we all call him taffy   the thing is though  no one's dispensable in my book   we're like one big organism  one big animal   yeah  the guys upstairs on the phone   they're the mouth   the guys down here  the hands     and what part are you    good question   probably the humour   with responsibility comes harsh things   um    people look at me  they say   oh  he's tough  he was in the army    he's going to be hard  by the book    but     i am caring and sensitive   isn't  schindler's list  a brilliant film   yeah   see  people think a strong man can't be sensitive   but i'm thoughtful and caring     sorry  what's this about   about the picture of david with the two blokes jizzing on him   were they both jizzing on him   i thought he was sucking one of them off   i don't think     no  look  it's just jizzing   well  i didn't do it   good  fine   well  i'm glad we had this little chat   i don't want you to think of me as your boss     well  you're not   i'm higher up than you  so i am   what i'm saying is  don't think of me as a boss     but know that i am    i don't think you are   i'm team leader  so i am  i'm higher up than you   gareth keenan   right  seriously  now  just stop it   yes  i've had office romances   loads   not here  another place i worked at   good looking ones as well   but they're not a good idea  office romances   it's like shitting on your own doorstep   i've had loads of offers here  but i go   no way    distracting  and that's actually one of the major arguments  against letting gay men into the army   i haven't got a problem with that    a gay man's not going to put me off  i can handle myself    but if we were in battle   is he going to be looking at the enemy or looking at me  going   oooh    you know   he looks tasty in his uniform    and i'm not homophobic   come and look at my cd collection   you'll find queen  george michael  pet shop boys   they're all bummers   all right  lads  what are you watching     it's my dog shagging his dog    oh  yeah   glynn  david's made it clear to you you'll be losing personnel   that's funny  look at his face   i'm sorry to interrupt  do you think you can lose any more staff     i know you lost julie anderton    who     opening a can of worms    julie  david fired her     never heard of her    loyalty   when someone leaves  they no longer exist   she never existed  did she     well      you made her up   you back me into a corner and i act       you lied    it's a form of acting   can you take this upstairs  we're busy     you don't look busy    do you want me to get busy  love   sorry   gazza likes some posh     a word with you now    yup   that was out of order in a way     ooh    i'm not in trouble   what she needs is a good shagging   i might bloody have to now  see you later   now  then  you two   dawn and tim   what do you want  gareth   i've been assigned to find out who did the picture   right  who was it     well  i don't know    will you get fired     will i get fired    if you don't know   well  i'm doing investigations now  was it one of you two   yes  christ  you're good     was it    no   i knew it wasn't   i'm not going to fire you if you know anything    because      you couldn't     i could    how   i'd say   you're fired  clear your desk    i'd say you don't have the authority   not true  not true   because in this room  i have special       needs    no  i am a special       needs child    no  and that's not funny     i won't have you fired because      you couldn't   that's all   i can't believe their total lack of respect   not only did they undermine you in an authoritative sense     come in  gareth      but they left an image in my mind  of you naked on all fours   being quite literally done doggie style   david     carry on    what is it   i've found the guilty man     have you indeed    can this wait  david   er  yeah   but if i tell you there's sexist pornography   which i hate    going round the office  do you want it to wait   pornography     who was it    surprise

disciplining has to be done   then the laughter stops for that amount of time  then continues   rehabilitation notwithstanding   it's everywhere  oh   how did you find out   i suspected the pictures came off the internet   so i checked everyone's computer   there is a log of every web page you've visited   you just go to internet page and then    history     well  it's not worth it      it only takes a second   i don't want to know how it's done  in a way   can you delete the history thing on the computer  we should really     david  this is a meeting    yeah  yeah   ok  that's all  anything
