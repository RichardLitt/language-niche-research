 ah  alex  paul     so  are there any rules    er  rules   ground rules     anything i should know before we start    oh  not really   it's more or less up to you   oh  right  right  i'm a customer   yeah   though in my profession  we say that the customer is always wrong   it's a    it's a therapist's joke   so  do you recognise me   no   i'm sorry  uh  should i   i was told you were the best  a man in tune with everything around him     so you should    thank you   but i do think that in this profession    the best  is really a matter of personal opinion   no  the best can be established by facts and figures   you're the best  i did my research   couple of former patients  someone who knew you from graduate school     does that pressure you    is it important for you to know    that i am the best    yes   it's nothing personal  i always go to the best   dentists  mechanics   you know what they say   save now  pay later   so what do you think being the best therapist entails   do you recognise me   no  i     i    i don't   let me help   the madrasah murderer     does that mean anything to you    no   it wasn't that long ago   us navy aircraft hit a target on the outskirts of baghdad   naval intelligence identified the structure  as an insurgents' safe house  a bunker  turns out it's a madrasah   let me tell you what that is  it's an islamic religious school   boys like bees in a beehive studying the koran      rings a bell    yes  i remember that  yes   so  that's me   i flew that mission   the madrasah murderer   so  uh  do you surf the net   well  somehow    well  it wasn't really somehow  it was     let's call a spade a spade  a leak  probably another intelligence fuck up   anyway  i was identified as the pilot in that mission  and my photo was placed on fundamentalist websites   and i'm not talking al jazeera  i'm talking websites that are     asking for my head on a platter   offering up the heavens and 40 virgins  to anyone who will slit my throat from ear to ear   here  um     here you are  it's not a recent photo  it's a photo taken when i was 18   on a high school trip to europe  holland   that city with the miniatures  ult    utrecht     utrecht    right   so while i'm talking to you  a million fanatics are downloading my portrait  and printing it out as a dartboard   silly motherfuckers     so  why have you come to see me    whoa  whoa  we'll get to that   so you're probably thinking   what's it like    he flew his mission  then he flew back   and he saw the bodies of those children on cnn    you're probably trying to figure out what went through his head   let me tell you   after that kind of mission  i don't watch cnn   i go to sleep   i'm dead tired   and you're probably dying to ask how i can sleep nights   ok  um       how do you sleep    i sleep well  thank you very much   knowing it was mission accomplished and with great precision   i followed my orders  which were hit my target and hit it on time   time and target  do you know  we have to hit our targets  within two seconds of the estimated time   it's surgical  and that's one small window and i have never missed it   if i had failed that task  i'd be in trouble with my superiors   with my conscience and with the system   but i hit my target   so  i sleep like a baby   um  h how many     children     died in this    in this mission   the media puts it at 16     and the air force    the navy  doctor  listen   the navy says nothing and why should it   we're not into body counts  we just hit targets   we don't look back over our shoulder   we do our thing so you can sit here in peace   talking to people for a living     so when did you hear that children had been killed   the following afternoon  i heard it on the internet   what exactly did you hear   anything specifically that you remember   like what  it's not like there's time in the day to be surfing the net   this was a moment  i got away   there's a lot of stuff to keep me busy   what kind of stuff   mission review  aerial photos  videos  just data  stuff   preparation versus execution   every tiny technical aspect of our flight is recorded and analysed by the man   there's nowhere to hide  and that's the way it should be   it's just stuff and more stuff   when my mother died  my father had a year's worth of stuff to deal with   last will and testament  her office  garden   a lifetime of photo albums   and every time i talked to him  i'd ask how he was  expecting  uh     you know  that    he'd break down   finally    it never ends  alex  it never ends  your mother left such a mess    she didn't know she was gonna die    and that's all he said   after less than a year  he met another woman and got married  just like that   how did that make you feel   well  surprised  a whole life together and not a single tear   mm   it's interesting that you compare the death of your mother  with this mission that you've just flown   that's very clever of you   but there's no relation whatsoever   my mother's death was the most traumatic event in my life so far   that mission was just another mission for alex  there is no comparison   anyway  look  that's over and i'm back now at my home base  and now i'm on r r   what kind of things do you do for r r   don't try to get ahead of me   i'm a runner  i was a hell of a runner in high school  and i'm still a good one for an old man  so  i run with my fairy friend   this gay guy who could kick your ass at any sport     and does he have a name  this friend    mm     daniel    daniel   we've been running together for a long time  between six and ten miles   depending on whether one of us is on his period  only this time  i challenged him   it was no good running in the middle east  not for the us military   unless you want a bomb to blow your balls off   so  i wanted to do some serious running  i said   let's go for 15    after 15 miles  i said   20   he didn't want it   i said   ok  i'll go on my own   so  he followed   i said   you know  only six more and it's a marathon  let's do it    he wanted to stop  little bitch   but i wasn't gonna stop   no stop   we were out of water  we were on fumes   at 22 miles  i had a heart attack and died   a textbook case  straight out of med school   enlargement of the left ventricle   in accordance with the family history on both sides  fatal   according to the ekg and according to statistics   i had a 97 3 per cent chance of dying   or a 2 7 per cent chance of living  anyway  dead   you actually died   in the clinical sense   no pulse  no brain activity  total clinical death   but here i am   now i'm gonna disappoint you  doctor   wanna know why i'm gonna disappoint you   let me help you   the light  the tunnel  life flashing before my eyes   that's what you're interested in  right   no  i wasn't actually thinking of that at all  but i am interested     tell me    i couldn't give a shit about it either   but that's all everyone wanted to know about   my father  my wife   everyone wanted to hear about the goddamn tunnel   just such bullshit   do you feel that maybe you disappointed people by not having that experience   that maybe in some way you failed to deliver the goods   nobody really knows what was going through my mind  during those last few moments   as soon as there was no more tunnel  no one was interested   and what was going through your mind   oh  i knew what was happening  you can tell   and you're afraid it's the end   in all that time until i lost consciousness     all that time    i don't know  it was maybe seconds  maybe half a minute   all that time i kept trying to figure out if i had a hard on   i don't know how i remembered  it was something my grandmother told me   when i was in high school  and she said  when grandpa died  she found him lying naked in the bathtub with a huge erection   now  he's    he was 92 years old   she hadn't seen an erection like that in 20 years   she liked it  she said that was god's final gift to a man   a dead man's boner  they call it angel lust   anyway  i'm lying there thinking about that story   i know what's happening and i said to myself    god almighty  just don't let me have an erection now  not a hard on    because if you had an erection  it would mean     that would mean that i was dead   and your friend daniel was with you throughout this   yeah  resuscitation  cpr    daniel's a doctor  i forgot to say that   oh  for a minute i thought you were going to say something else   that perhaps your fear of an erection was associated  with the presence of your friend  daniel    excuse me   you're exaggerating  i explained something simple   a dead man's erection   what's that got to do with daniel   well  maybe i didn't make myself clear earlier on  when i was talking about the customer always being wrong   what i meant was that sometimes the patient hides things  from his therapist  from himself   and so part of our job is to uncover the things that we hide     so  my secret is i'm afraid of homosexuals   no  not necessarily  but i just wanted to clarify that   yeah  that's neither here nor there  i want to get to my point   i didn't have the erection  so relax   but i remember very vividly that moment just before passing out   before losing consciousness   losing consciousness  that's a funny expression   why do you think that's a funny expression   losing consciousness   it's an expression my father would use   everything in terms of profits and loss   fits him like a glove   so something about how you describe your last moments  is equated with your father's seeing things in terms of profit and loss   ok  ok  with all due respect  i think we've come to this way too early   the father son relationship stuff shouldn't come up so soon     you think it's too soon    forget what i feel   i know it's too soon  i wanna know what you think     so you're    you're testing me    i'm entitled to some testing  i'm paying   actually  i think you've been testing me since you walked in   you've asked about me and my reputation   you ask  you practically demand that i ask certain questions  that you think i am dying to ask   it's important to you  i think  that i adhere to certain standards  you set before you walked through the door   what's wrong with that  look  i did my research   it's a 1   hour drive to get here and i'm paying you good money   and i'm expected to tell you  a perfect stranger  the most intimate things about my life   plus there are risks here   it's not like the navy's gonna give me a medal for spilling my guts   i'm not gonna open up to you without knowing what you are   and what do you expect to find  alex   how are we going to know that i'm a good enough therapist for you   i'll know     according to your opinion     my opinion of what    of the issue i came to talk about   but i'll come to that in a minute   it's to do with what happened after taking me out of the freezer   the freezer   oh  you mean that you were grounded   no  literally frozen  they froze me   the mobile intensive care unit arrived and put me in a suit that freezes you   they got one no more than three quarters of a mile from where i collapsed     and their er is tops    let's go back to this     we're getting there  you have no patience   i was told you're a good listener   now look  it works on a very simple principle   it reduces the shock to the body's systems by dropping the body temperature     so how long were you      in my case  48 hours  it's a record   there's no history of anyone who's been in that suit for such a long time   i guess i went a long way up that tunnel   the tunnel that wasn't there   no  unfortunately not   so tell me what you remember about this 48 hours   mostly i remember  um    a terrible fatigue   i guess that's why they call it  dead tired    it's physical  but mainly mental exhaustion   and i remember very clearly the relief i felt  when i succeeded in coming back over into the world   you say that you succeeded in coming back to this world   did    did you feel it was under your control     what are you trying to get at    i'm not trying to get at anything   but what you're describing is a strong will to live   during this experience  there was a decision to go on living   yeah  i guess you're right   despite having made this effort to live     everybody's disappointed   it's not every day people meet someone who's come back from the dead   it's a one in a million thing  and if you don't supply the goods  then     listen  i have never spent a day in my life in a hospital   you get it  never   so  perhaps your anger isn't directed at those people interested in the tunnel   perhaps you're angry at yourself  alex  how your body betrayed you   this is a systems failure that was not supposed to happen to somebody like you   hmh   i have a brother  who's not bright  he's a real estate agent   anyway  he's a great athlete  and he once proved to me   and he does his research  believe me     that all the great quarterbacks in the history of football  were also the best looking   namath  staubach  cunningham  they're all good iooking people   the best iooking students in the class are often great athletes     you know why that is    i've no idea   it's got nothing to do with sports   when they got their gift from god the father   or whoever the hell doles out the talent  they got the whole package    beauty  talent  character   that's how it is  it's an evolutionary thing   so  how is your football   nah   football's not my game  running  of course   wrestling  pole vault  once upon a time   but now  i am part of a military elite   athletes may be popular  but we are the cr me de la cr me   you have to understand  this is a person whose whole life was perfect   people in my line of work are born to excel  to be perfect   it wasn't our choice  it was life that chose us to be the best   and what does that mean   life chose us    yeah  you don't become a fighter pilot suddenly at age 20   at age seven or eight  when you're in the third grade   you know you're talented   you know you're headed somewhere special  you are going to be the best  and it all lays out right in front of you   top grades  varsity letters  you name it   i'm a topgun grad  you understand that  that training is not for pussies   so if you don't achieve your personal best     are you disappointed in yourself    no  no  that's not         how much longer do we have    we've got time  i'ii     i'll tell you when it's    when it's time   ok  so here's my point  finally   i came to get your advice on something   sure   i decided to go there  to the target   you understand what i'm talking about here   you mean to the site where you dropped the bomb  to the school   madrasah  i wanna go back  take a look around     where the children were killed    i know what you're thinking   so let me straighten this out   i don't have a guilty conscience  i already told you that  i sleep very well     but why would you want to go back    i'm interested   from the moment i came out of that freezer  i knew i wanted to go back   it came up in a conversation i had with daniel when he visited me at the hospital   he thinks i'm gonna freak out or something   he thinks it's a crazy thing to do   and he said i need to see someone first   psychologist  psychiatrist     don't you think it's dangerous    not at all   i don't think anyone would recognise me     but your picture's on the internet    no way  you saw the picture   it's ridiculous  my mother wouldn't recognise me  not even michaela     who's michaela    my wife     what does she think of all this    what's she got to do with it   don't you talk with your wife   this is not for me  all this  what do you feel  what do you think    i asked you something  i came to you to consult about something specific   so  you want me to tell you that this desire of yours  to go back to where the bombing took place is a good thing   ok  yeah  yeah  yes   do you want me to take responsibility for this visit   ok  don't make me into an idiot  are you telling me i'm not taking responsibility   no  i'm just going back to something you said earlier on   remember you said that life chose you  to be a member of an elite  that it wasn't your decision   maybe that's an attitude you're comfortable with   you're comfortable with it because you don't have to make any decisions   it relieves you of responsibility   your commanding officer  he makes the decisions   conveys them to you and you execute them   wait  are you trying to tell me that i'm asking you  to be my commanding officer   ok  i'll buy it   so  are you willing to    to be my co   for  150 an hour   i don't think i'm    i don't think i'm qualified for that   but would you agree to be your own commanding officer   oh  listen  you know what  just leave it alone  i     i'm not gonna get anything useful out of you     and you're supposed to be the best    i'm not the best   maybe you're the best  but i'm    i'm not   think about the ramifications of what you're about to do   you're going back to a place where you dropped a bomb   your face is on the internet  and there's a price on your head   wait  now you're saying you agree with daniel  that i've gone crazy     how would you feel if i did agree    how hard is a straight answer     i got a plane to catch    why  where    where are you going   are you not listening to me  i am going back there   nonstop  dc to frankfurt  then frankfurt amman   thursday morning  by charter  to baghdad   you're leaving tonight   good morning  doctor   i'm going back as part of a church group  a charity   and we're visiting those neighbourhoods   no  this is not part of navy protocol   may i ask you something  when you were running with daniel  22 miles   mm     how long did that take    i don't know  almost three hours   daniel wanted to quit   he's always going on about optimum pulse during exercise   he thought we shouldn't go over 85 per cent   you know what i find interesting   that shortly after you complete this mission   you go on leave and against the advice of your best friend   who also happens to be a medical doctor   you work yourself up into a state of extreme exertion   it's as if you were avoiding going back to active duty   no  i have no problem flying again  in fact  i'm dying to get back in action   do you not see a connection between your collapse and what went before   now  i know you say you don't have any guilt feelings   but don't you think there's a strong desire there to atone for your actions   do you have any coffee round here   i could use a good cup of coffee   um  our time is up  i'm afraid     i still got things i wanna talk about    i'm happy to see you again   it       i think it's important that you keep talking about all this   ok  i'll keep that in mind   i'd better pay you now  who knows how this little trip will turn out   you're serious about travelling today   it's this way  i'll write you an invoice for the     don't worry about it     aren't you gonna wish me luck    yes   good luck  alex   english sdh
