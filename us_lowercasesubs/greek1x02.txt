  casey  i'll make it up to you    sweetie  we're even   think about it   was there ever a time when radio stations actually played music   almost makes me want to listen to npr   i said i want to listen with npr   seriously  what is wrong with you  evan stuff   things are great with evan  why wouldn't they be   i just assumed it would take a girl more than a couple of days  to get over the fact her boyfriend hooked up with one of her pledges  as her younger brother watched   look  what happened between  evan and rebecca logan on rush night sucked a lot   but it's behind us  so we're totally fine   especially with what we've gotta do tonight     business as usual    this is wgod   you're listening to inspirational recordings     ugh  son of a     only on cyprus  the gospel   heavenly music for life and after   you want to hear an interesting tidbit of info   absolutely  anything   all right  this school in florida  had to shut down one of their fraternities for hazing after one of pledges was forced to     break several laws against both god and nature during cinco de mayo last year   those fraternities sure sound like fun   this isn't hazing  this is just laundry   that's probably how it started with that poor cinco de mayo boy   you can't let a few bad apples ruin the bunch  if that were the case   no one would ever join the catholic church   well  that's exactly why i'm baptist   hazing is just this small part   it's running errands  helping out around the house   an occasional prank or two maybe   i feel like    i don't know  i'm earning my keep     like i belong    whatever helps you sleep at night  rusty   speaking of  physics  9 a m   i hope i can sleep tonight   just so you know  i'd never force you to do anything you didn't want to prove yourself to me   thanks  dale     hey  hey  for tonight  could we not      it helps me sleep   this next dedication goes out to cyprus rhodes   where dale wants his roommate rusty to know  he's praying for him and his blasphemous ways   deploy  spitter  deploy  deploy   pledge week   extraction complete  move out  men    the laundry     hello    pledge   you have five minutes to get your ass to the house or suffer the consequences   shoot   let's go   rebecca logan   hey  guys   what's up   your happy day   we're kidnapping you for pledge orientation and midnight snacks back at the house   you guys scared me   no reason to be scared   sorry   sorry  guys   i was at the student center across campus   no problem  pledge owens   i will have to ask you to drop and give me 20  though     are you serious    all of you   the success of one brother is success for everyone   and the failure of one affects us all   i am your pledge master  brother chambers   and it is my duty to instill in you the ideals we honor here   self improvement   leadership   and dedication   and part of dedication is punctuality   the hardcover you'll feel dropping on your spine is the omega kal pledge book   you will be tested on it   now initiation is not intended to humiliate   it's purpose is to take you from the boys you are now  and challenge you to become real men   you all have one hour     to melt these blocks of ice   oh  yeah  there is a catch  do it naked   let's go   come on  you heard him     remove your blindfolds    take 'em off   greetings   four score and seven years ago   our forefathers  who    art in heaven  hallow it be their name   brought unto continent kappa tau gamma   yea  though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death   we fear nothing  and neither will you   as tonight     you all become men   but not in the way you might be thinking   we do not have hookers  which isn't to say we didn't try   regardless     you all have been brought here before us  to participate in a ceremonial rite of passage   it derives from a secret spartan ritual known as cryptea   where a boy is sent out into the wild     to live off the land  fight for his life while protecting his village   if he wasn't devoured by those    gnarly looking wolfy things   then he returned to the village     a man     isn't that the beginning of 300    we did it first   you must stay out here all night  you cannot sleep   also  the spartan boys had to wear their battle clothes for 24 hours   they were out there for months   silence   oh  yeah  you guys gotta do some light gardening   'cause the weeds are getting kind of bad back here   and to be one with the earth   which was something else they did back then   all right  we'll see you guys in the morning when you're men   be well     hey  i'm rusty    rusty  right   yeah  ben bennett   oh  cool name   so what's your major   undeclared  i guess  yours   polymer science   bummer   okay  so tomorrow is our annual pledge scavenger hunt   meet me in the quad  then thursday is our big sis  little sis revealing   where you'll learn who will be your big sister   let's eat   these girls are so awesome     i love every one of them    oh  my gosh  you guys   this is like the best night ever  my mom was a zbz  and she's so proud of me   oh  well     you get some food  we're so happy you're here   except that one     legacies    didn't understand a word she said   like it matters  whatever  i'm still a proud prez  you handled the whole situation so well   look around  someday this could all be yours   oh  here's our crown jewel now   i am so excited to be here  i feel like you all can take such good care of me   hey  casey  why don't you go show rebecca her new room   fine   so here it is   you know  i wanted to talk to you about something   it's much smaller than imagined   it's the only room we have left   you know  we normally can't allow freshmen to live in the house   i know that i'm a campus celebrity   which is so weird just because my dad's a senator and rich and famous and whatever  but please     no special treatment   except for your own room in the house   and maybe my own tivo   check out that room  it's huge   yeah  um  this is my room   and speaking of things that are mine     i found you sort of had sex with evan chambers   i did  rush night  and it was amazing   okay  please stop talking  here's the thing   evan chambers is my boyfriend   oh  my god   how awkward for you   are you guys breaking up   um  no   anyway    i just wanted to say that  at zeta beta for a sister to hook up with another sister's boyfriend   it's considered bad form   well  i had no idea he was your boyfriend at the time   of course  and i'm just offering some advice  in the spirit of sisterhood   maybe you want to take some time to get to know a guy before you hook up with him   like  see if he's in a relationship   interesting  that's some pretty great advice   you must be pretty perfect to dole out that kind of advice     i'm not saying i'm perfect      well  we agree on something   because i know i'm not perfect     let me rephrase      no  i get it   i hooked up with your boyfriend   and i'm sorry for you about that   but i'm not gonna apologize to you for doing it   can i offer you some sisterly advice   maybe you should spend a little less time on your sisters   and a little more time on your boyfriend   well       thanks for the advice    no  thank you   i've learned a lot   and i was totally chill  i was like    you might want to be a little more careful   and she was like   back off    oh  and by the way  i'm totally happy dressing like donna karan's skanky little sister    i know  right  verbatim almost  and now i have to live with her   and be nice to her   and she's evil   well  you know  she's not active yet     we could bounce her out    are you kidding   frannie'd never let that happen   yeah  but people leave  they quit     if they're pushed too hard   oh  i like that   and sometimes accidents do happen   i'm not gonna kill her  ash   no  not kill   injure   no  no  this is good  it's easy   we'll run her ragged and make her quit   rebecca logan must go   thought you might need those     hey  good job on the weeds    crap     it looks awesome back here    i was the only pledge who fell asleep   well  it looks like you got off easy   usually on the first person who falls asleep  the pledges tend to    oh   what happens usually   that person gets the most sleep  you've got some mud     they dye your feet    oh  good one  guys   because they care  buddy  because they care   when i mentioned my major  this one guy looked at me like i was terminal   they don't know you  just give 'em some time   yeah  just the first week   in a month  this'll all be behind me   yeah  you betcha   atta boy   you know  we haven't spent any time together lately   we're okay  right   of course   we've both been busy   yeah  well  you do what you gotta do   if you want  you can come tonight and hang with me at dobbler's   done   wait  is that your brother     rusty  are you sleepwalking    oh  my god     hey  case    evan   people can see you  people can see you standing near me   that is typical kappa tau crap  man   what  this  no  this was an accident  i fell down some stairs   and cut two holes in the butt of your jammies   i was holding scissors   hang in there  first week is always the worst  because that's when classes are the easiest   class  what time is it     it's almost 9 00    what   oh  my gosh   i'm screwed  i gotta go  i'm screwed     his feet were blue    yeah   oh  my gosh  who is that   has class started yet  why are there so many people   no  no  you can't sit there   why  this is the only seat left     i'm sorry  it's saved    for who   for that guy  hey  i saved your seat   if everyone could take their    you   this is a university classroom  not a homeless shelter   i'm sorry  sir   i'm not homeless  i'm in a fraternity   i like you better homeless  sit   the brain surgeons at the registrar's office overbooked this class   we have 100 seats and 124 students   but that's not a problem for me   it's a problem for you    your first problem set  which i want completed and in my hands  no later than 9 a m  thursday   work in groups  work alone  i don't care  based on results   will find something else to do   maybe kill some more brain cells at the frat house   you have 20 things on or around campus  that you have to find and take pictures of with your handy dandy zbz cams   might be something like a picture of the football stadium   or a picture of you making out with a football player   football player  i love football players  i want to date a football player one day   okay  you have until 7 00 p m   to complete your lists and haul ass back to dobbler's   if you do not make it by then  you will not remain  in the running toward becoming america's next top zeta beta  questions   no  okay  go   wait  i think i have a joke list or something   what    panther  middle aged hooker  male faculty member shirtless    let me take a look at that   oh  two puppies wearing hats   the lists were passed out randomly  and no special treatment  right   you're just one of the girls now  they're all doing their own lists   it might get weird if we gave you your own room  and then gave you an easier list because you can't do the one you have       i can do it    of course you can   you're rebecca freakin' logan   you can totally do this  kick ass   i thought she was gonna quit right then   she'll never finish the list   i thought the first week was supposed to be easy   why can't he just find a bigger room  why do we have to do this   because he's teacher and we do as we're told   but this is ridiculous  he's testing us on concepts and theories he hasn't even taught us yet   i mean   microscopic and macroscopic aspects of deformation and fracture    no  i've heard of that before    spinodal decomposition and martensitic reactions    that was something to do  with the morphological changes in       something    hey     why don't we work together    'cause i don't need to    molecular foundations  of polymer viscoelasticity  pertaining to the rouse bueche theory  and the boltzmann superposition principle      we should get started tonight    great   no  i can't  i can't tonight  i have to be at the house every night this week   happy failing   we can just split it up   i can get my half done in my spare time   amen   i'm gonna try to have faith in you  rusty   good luck  man   i'm not homeless   hey  you know  not that i'm not enjoying your company  ashleigh   but when are you done   'cause i was thinking we could grab dinner  and we'd go back to my house   we still have one girl left   okay  who   rebecca logan   i think i need another lemon drop   yeah   case  i didn't see you down there     heading out    another night of debauchery with the pledges   actually  i wanted to talk to you about that   i don't know exactly what you guys do over there   you never heard about the goats   just go easy on rusty  okay   he's new to all this  and i want to make sure he's not going to be scarred for life   did you really come down here to talk to me about rusty   whom until last week didn't exist   my relationship with rusty has changed since last week   seems like a lot of relationships changed last week   here you go     you don't have to buy me a drink    it's okay  i didn't   i put it on your tab   hey  hey  hey  hey  what's taking so long over here   i was just not buying your girlfriend a drink   don't you have your own girlfriend to not buy drinks for   it's just not as fun  i guess   this is ridiculous   can we be mature and just say what we're all thinking   how the hell could they cancel gilmore girls   unclench  evs  casey and i were just talking about the pledges   yeah  oh  yeah  yeah  yeah  we saw the work you guys did on rusty   let me ask you  what exactly is the point of that form of hazing   uh  our own amusement   oh  well  you're doing them a lot of good   well  we don't have to train our pledges  they already rock   are you implying that your pledges are better than our pledges   you're right  i'm sorry  let me clarify   our pledges could kick your pledges' asses any day     hmm  is that a challenge    guys  come on   no  no  no  what kind of competion are we talking about here   who's got the most j  crew v necks   wait  you might have us there   you know  we could kick your ass at anything     really    yeah  we could   excuse us  rebecca's not coming   she quit   she got busted by campus security for sneaking into the men's faculty locker room   are we in trouble   okay  guys  tonight's new rite of passage  will begin shortly   we're just waiting on the sensel  who's     stop everything   nice kimonos   big news  our pledges have been challenged  by the nimrods over at omega kal   we're gonna destroy 'em     what's the game    something fair   something classic  and old family favorite   beer pong   here tomorrow night   uh  tomorrow night   what if we have school work to do   spitter  that's impossible  did you not hear a word of what i just said   it's against the omega kais   besides  it's the first week of school  it's always easy   you could probably just sit this one out  spitter  i mean  maybe this isn't your kind of thing   do what you gotta do  russ   case  frannie is calling an emergency meeting about rebecca   now  you think she knows anything about the list rebecca had     i guess we're about to find out    okay  i'll meet you in there   case  can i talk to you   uh  now is like the absolute worst time  please  just two minutes   okay  go  hurry     i've got this scheduling issue    seriously   buy a calendar  done   but tonight the kappa taus are hosting this beer pong event   which i'm not really sure what that is   classy choice  cappie   i also have to finish this really hard problem set in order to stay in this physics class   easy  drop the class  and you're welcome   i can't just drop the class  case  it's a prequisite   then skip beer pong  but know it's a lot of fun   i can't skip  i'm just a pledge   how do you juggle school and your sority stuff   i don't take honors engineering classes  look  i really need to go   that's all you got for me   okay  you knew joining a fraternity wasn't gonna be easy   you're in this super hard  super brainiac program that's gonna take up a lot of time   but being in a fraternity takes time too   so you have to make a choice  choices are good   choices make you pick a path and stay the course   it's not fair  why can't i do both   well  if you could  you wouldn't be here right now   this is one reason among many why guys like you aren't in fraternities   but the world isn't black and white  rember   i can be gray  i can be an amalgam   why does every conversation we have turn into a vocab test   forget it   be realistic  russ   be my sister  case   panhellenic has called five times already wanting to know how we're going to handle the situation   they're implying hazing  what the hell am i supposed to tell them   she's on drugs   what was she doing in there   if this were any other girl on campus  no one would care   it's just because she's rebecca logan   maybe it's a good thing this happened for us now     what do you mean    well   what she brings to this sorority in notoriety  pales in comparison to all we're going to have to do to manage our reputation   she lives under a microscope   which means we're gonna have to live under a microscope too   and she's covered in bacteria   i mean   if she messes up again  then our name's gonna be right alongside hers     it might be best      excuse me   may i have a moment of your time   this is a closed meeting  rebecca  officers only   this will just take a second   okay   i made a huge mistake  i went way overboard with the scavenger hunt   i was just trying to make you proud  frannie   make me proud   oh  you don't have to prove anything to me  or anyone here  we all love you   we still have to answer to panhellenic and the university   it's taken care of   taken care of   my father became involved   he spoke with the provost and a rep at panhellenic  and suggested that it would be in everyone's best interest if this all just went away   so it has   i won't allow my poor judgment to affect my sisters   you are amazing   and for all the trouble i've caused you all   my father has offered us his private jet for us to use any time we want it   oh  my god  my god  we got a jet     is it a g5    yes  actually it is  how did you know   hey  study buddy   you done yet     just about    where you headed   i'm really kind of unfocused in here   you know  so i'm gonna go  um   to the library to work on the problem set  for physics   well  when are you gonna be done  'cause i'm already done  i finished it about  was tough  but i got through it   and i was able to teach myself a lot of stuff that's    that's pretty advanced   i'll definitely have my half   hey  i can come with you and help   i'm really smart   i know you are  dale  but i want to do my part   you know     i'll see you    hey  rusty     yeah    aren't you forgetting something     rusty    yeah   you forgot your backpack   oh  right   gentlemen     and omega kais     welcome to the first annual kappa tau omega kal pledge tourney   all right  we got nine pledges on each side   house with the highest number of wins    wins   any questions   um  how do you play   you know  we could drop one of our guys to make it an even game   it's actually a great question  spitter   beer pong rules and regulations differ all over the world   adhering to the north american beer pong association regulations   two players square off on their respective sides   each taking a turn hitting a ping pong ball across a table with the aim  of making their ball land in one of several cups of beer   now if he    or she    is successful   then that opponent must drink that cup of beer   the player who drinks all the cups loses   to the notion though that  everyone wins in this game   so let's do it  let the games begin   hey   so i guess this is gonna be the drawback of being in different houses   it's too bad you didn't come to omega kal  but i get it   the whole evan thing   there's no reason we still can't be friends   yeah  yeah   i mean  just because our houses are in competition doesn't mean     doesn't mean we have to be  right   yeah     so what number    i'm nine    so what number    i'm nine   hey   so    good news   everything has been smoothed over completely   great   there's one thing though   rebecca wants your room   how did you break the bad news   explain something to me   why rebecca logan given so many hand things to find on the scavenger hunt   she wasn't  shirtless faculty member   middle aged panther     the point is      and the point is  you're still freaked out about the whole evan thing   and you lost control   you told me you could handle it  and you didn't   rebecca's getting the room   hey  calvin  what's your number   home or cell   no  i mean your position     what number did you draw    nine   so do you wanna grab some beers after this or something     beers    sure   all right  next up  number nine   and game point   spitter    you're up   hey    may the best man win   yeah  best man win   all right   don't choke   how you feeling  you good   okay  i want you to relax  all right   you know  there are these moments in life  when you are confronted with something that you think is monumental   but 10  20 years down the road you'll look back and you'll laugh   yeah   this is not one of those moments   this is the most important thing that could ever happen to you  or any of us in this entire world   good luck  don't lose   all right  score's tied   the winner of this game will determine which pledges rock  and which pledges suck   it's just kind of like ping pong  i was champion five years in a row in the eagle scouts   you were in the eagle scouts   good game  cal   oh  yeah  the best won man  cal   you guys should've picked naked ice melting   wait  is that supposed to be a secret omega kal thing   hope you're ready to do some pushups  pledge   oh  you bet    ugh   spitter  hey  you kicked ass  man   it was     hell  yeah   spitter  spitter    i'm up  you didn't finish   you didn't finish  it's due in ten minutes   i'll turn in what we have   no  what we have can't compete with what the other kids have  because they take this seriously   i prayed to god   why would he forsake me   okay  this is class is a prerequisite that's only offered in the fall   which means if we don't take it now we can't take it until next year   which means we can't start our core classes for two years  which means i can't  finish undergrad till 2012  which means i can't finish grad school until 2015       dale  i'm sorry    no  no  you've ruined my future   and my kids' future and my grandkids' future   you've disrupted the space time continuum   and you gotta fix it  you gotta build a time machine right now     right now we gotta build a time machine      dale  stop  stop   i'll fix this  i promise   your grandkids will be fine  i'll fix this   this beyond sucks   is this yours or mine   does it matter  with the space in that crappy little room all our stuff is gonna be thrown together anyway   oh  could you give me a better eta on when you're gonna be completely out of here   i scheduled some movers to be here at  but don't worry  i want you all to take your time and let me know when this afternoon you're going to have all your stuff out of here   thanks   you know  that's it  screw this   we gotta talk   i've tried to be cool about this   i've tried not to get upset  but this is me upset   i'm officially very upset   i know rebecca's great for us   our alums love the idea of her  she gives us a jet   blah blah blah  but i can't take it anymore   she slept with my boyfriend   i took him back  now she's stealing my room  and all i've been is nice to her   i know  except for the whole shirtless faculty member thing   which we've already discussed was a mistake and we're past   i've given you two years of dedication   and she's given me two weeks of hell   so you have to choose  her or me   is this what friends do  casey   give each other ultimatums   i'm sorry  frannie  but i don't know what else to do   okay  let me consider this   on the one hand  we have you     who put this entire sorority in danger by hazing rebecca   i didn't think she'd finish the list   we could've been put on probation  or even worse  made an example of and suspended   you put yourself and your petty squabble with rebecca before the sority   well  when you say it like that it sounds really bad   and on other hand   i have a senator's daughter and a jet     frannie      look   the best thing i can do for you right now  is forget this conversation ever happened   because trust me   you don't want me choose   hey  cap   can i talk to you   sure  what is it  buddy  hey  can you do me a favor and crouch down on all fours     uh  okay    thank you   i have to quit the fraternity   relax  i'm almost done   no  i mean  i really have to quit  cappie   i can't manage kappa tau and engineering   i was supposed to turn in this physics problem set   but i didn't because of last night   now i missed the deadline this morning   i messed up my roommate because we were working on it together   he's mad at me  and he won't even    talk to me now      rusty   school comes first   i know  so i can have the successful  professional future   no  so you won't get kicked out and you can stay here forever   you know you could've skipped beer pong last night  right   but i wanted to make my pledge brothers like me   relax  you belong there   thanks  but it's too late   it's never too late   you didn't ask any of us for help   now go finish that test  you're not the first kappa tau who's missed a deadline   oh  don't tell me that's out of order   yep  sorry  gotta take the stairs   i have to get to the parking lot   no can do  better go out that door and around   let's get this right  guys  this is love tap 23   love tap 23  break     18  24    18  24   hike   oh  jeez  oh  jeez   you damn frat boys  you almost killed me     what are your names    we're very sorry   what fraternity
