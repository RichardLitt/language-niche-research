   1 you are being watched   the government has a secret system   a machine that spies on you every hour of every day   i know because i built it   i designed the machine to detect acts of terror   but it sees everything   violet crimes involving ordinary people   people like you   crimes the government considered irrelevant   they wouldn't act  so i decided i would   but i needed a partner   someone with the skills to intervene   hunted by the authorities  we work in secret   you'll never find us   but victim or perpetrator  if your number's up   we'll find you   sync and corrections by n17t01  hey  it's me   yeah  i'm sorry  i got tied up here at work   i was thinking we could grab a bite  okay   usual place   okay  see you in 30  yeah  bye   hold it   almost missed it   those for your wife   uh  yes   i thought your wife liked roses   excuse me   do i know you   no   but i know you  bill   little relationship advice   if you're gonna step out on your wife   you need to think it through   do you work here   because if you do  you're fired   i'm more like an independent contractor   now  you don't seem like a bad guy  bill   you and your wife are having some problems   it happens   well  some women would just leave you   but some women  they might just hire a couple of guys  to come to your office   dismantle your surveillance cameras  to make it look like a robbery gone wrong    i would call the police and a good divorce lawyer   i've got a job for you   high priority  triple your usual fee   what's the name   yeah   good morning  finch   no problems last night   two hit men were waiting to kill a guy   just like you said they'd be   i took care of it  good   you should get some rest   thought i'd do a little research   i'll be interested to hear what you discover   we need to meet later   your machine kick out another number   somebody else is gonna be involved in a crime   this one is somewhat unusual   i'll let you know where to go   and  mr  reese  we'll meet on my schedule   not yours   detective carter   aren't you homicide   i don't have any cold ones for you   just a couple of guys ain't ever gonna play golf again   yeah  it's part of an ongoing investigation   what do we know about the shooter   this rich guy was on his way home   said a couple of guys tried to kill him   and this  uh  other gentleman  quote  intervened   unquote   let me guess  some guy in a suit   how did your research go   inconclusive   the number we've received  is for a girl named theresa whitaker    some disciplinary trouble   but basically a good kid   well  the machine did spit out her number   so she must be caught up in something   where can i find her   as i told you  mr  reese   this situation is somewhat unique   you see  theresa whitaker should be right here   she was murdered  along with the rest of her family   two years ago   so we're looking for a ghost   i thought you might still be here   i come bearing gifts  whisky   ah ha   and we won another award   look  i know our deal   i schmooze the board  i cash out the checks   i pick up the awards  you do most of the work   but  honestly  this is getting exhausting for me   i'm perfectly happy with the division of labor   always have been   what's this one for   this is for services to humanity   i didn't tell them that we laid off half the staff  in order to build this orwellian nightmare   said you wanted to make a difference   give something back  this orwellian nightmare   is this is the government feeds   direct from nsa at fort meade   that's every email  every phone call   surveillance cameras     in the country   no  that's just new york   i'm starting with the basics here   i'm trying to teach it to track people  using cell phone location data   facial recognition   i'm almost ready to move on to the next problem   what's the next problem   sorting them all out   terrorists don't exactly stand out on street corners  you know   you have to teach the machine to sift through the emails   wire tapped phones  bank transactions   looking for people that are hiding something   living double lives   people like you  in other words   how long will this take   four  five more years   so this is     everyone            nice spot   this is the last place theresa whitaker was seen alive   two years ago  her father grant  takes the family for a weekend sail   no one comes home   grant   he was a real estate developer   market crashed   he was upside down on 14 properties   according to the police   he shot his wife and kids   then turned the gun on himself   says here they found the bodies   just the parents and the 18 year old son   theresa's body was never recovered   uh   presumed dead    that's a reasonable assumption   the police only see what they choose to look for   the machine sees almost everything   if the girl's number has come up   she must be alive   then why hasn't she shown up by now   with the police or a relative   i don't know   but if the machine is right and she's still alive   she won't be for long   better find her   i'll need a police report on this   i'll have to talk to my friend in the department   hello  lionel   you  again   how the hell'd you get in here   took it off your friend stills   the one i shot with your gun  before you buried him out in oyster bay   i need you to pull a file for me   yeah  right after you pull my iad file   'cause they got me one step from fighting off  a whole cellblock of degenerates that i sent upstate   they think i'm dirty   that's because you are dirty  lionel   look  your predicament is not my doing or my concern   name's theresa whitaker   two year old murder suicide out in bowery bay   get me the file   i just can't believe that it came to this   we knew they were having  uh  financial issues   but i never   i never thought  that he would do anything like this   that's because he didn't   wish that he would have    come to me   wish he would have reached out   this was a professional hit   muzzle impressions were made after the fact   made it look point blank   like the father did it   cops missed it   and you know that how   that's how i would have done it   so why didn't the shooter kill theresa   that part i can't explain   or why she hasn't shown up anywhere else   i've tracked down a recent address  for the aunt and uncle in brooklyn heights   they might know what kind of trouble whitaker was in   i got a lead on another kid  who might know her whereabouts   sealed juvie record on theresa   seems she was picked up with an older boy for vandalism   deacon page   since  he's been popped multiple times for shoplifting   carrying a concealed weapon   so if theresa didn't go to family   maybe she went to friends   but we don't know how much time theresa has left   might need a little help  finch   hello  arthur bellinger  liberty state mutual   elizabeth whitaker   yes   we wrote the term life policies for grant whitaker   you and your husband derek are listed as next of kin   ex husband   the divorce went through last year   come in  thank you   in cases like this involving prolonged legal investigation   it can take some time to settle out   i'm surprised my brother in law  even kept up payments on life insurance   does this mean that they're gonna  stop searching for theresa   her body  i mean   the police have concluded their investigation   you weren't satisfied   no  it's   it's just     we buried an empty coffin   they   they said that the current would have taken her body   and i was hoping that maybe it would bring her home   i'm sorry   this is just drudging up some really difficult memories   not at all  i can only imagine   derek never came out of the funk   sometimes you just lose people   you don't have any contact information  for your ex husband  do you   no  we've barely spoken since we split   i have a   an old cell phone number   good luck tracking him down   you might want to mention that there's money involved   i have to ask this   did you and derek have any children   no kids   now i'm not even an aunt   smart as a whip  theresa   i loved her like she was my own daughter   unfortunately  you can't pick your parents   unbelievable   i've got eight case files connected to this guy's prints   and half of them have been redacted   here we go  missing persons '07   your trigger happy hobo  carter   only now he's a killer in a suit   well  maybe he's a recovering diplomat   they pulled the whole file   feds  this one's above your pay grade  carter   aunt's fine  uncle's mia   mia   you got no contact info   no answer on the cell phone  no forwarding address   where are you   i've been to every skate rat park in the city   nothing but attitude on wheels   no sign of theresa   no  but i think i just found our guy   what the     what's your problem  fool    200 fine to skate in the park   want to know the last time you seen this girl  deacon   what is this  some kind of sick joke   news flash  chief   old man went postal on her whole family   she's dead   or maybe not   maybe you seen her around  chief   that girl's gone  give me back my phone   is he riding you  what's up with that  man            theresa   theresa   wait   watch it  idiot   hi  harold   hello   morning  harold   listen  um  that database you're coding   we're gonna need it a little faster  okay   you   you got to keep up   okay  i'll see what i can do  dave   not exactly what i expected   software engineer of the month   that's very impressive   but it doesn't quite explain the private security   the unlimited funds   no  no  it wouldn't   i did some digging down in hr   seems you've worked here for 17 years   only been promoted twice   so how many of these people know you own the entire company   none of them   the best place to hide  mr  reese  as you well know   is in plain sight   and if i speak too loudly   say the wrong thing   the entire department could be overhauled   some would be reassigned  promoted   some would be fired   i'll make it quick  then   the good news  the girl is alive   and  uh  kicking   seems she has some trust issues   i  uh  i lost her   but i did figure out how she's been providing for herself   she left this at an atm machine   it's a skimmer   it captures account numbers and pins   if she tries to sell these online   i might be able to track her down   in the meantime  we need to figure out  who killed her family and why   her uncle's hiding from a dozen different creditors   but i'll find him   and i want to look at grant whitaker's finances  much more carefully   good   'cause this was a hit for hire   and i'm gonna look into the shooter   how   find out where i can hire one   so who's your friend  harold   guy behind the bar's a fixer   takes a piece of most contract killings in the city   if someone did wipe out the family   he might know who did it   hey  he don't talk to people  who just walk into the joint   lionel  you worried about me   i'm touched   don't let me see you around here again            got a name   let's go   fusco's ci  pointed me towards  a contract killer named solnick   problem is solnick got himself locked up for a separate job   so i've arranged a visit   who are you   did my lawyer quit again   no   i'd like to talk to you about that family you murdered   then dumped in the bowery bay   what  you don't want to talk about that one   how about some of the other people you killed   like that brother of that gang leader  that lives on your cell block   i'm sure he'd love to know his brother's last words   hmm   i get it   you're like me   a killer   a genuine bad guy   then i don't have to explain to you  what happened to those people on that boat   you already know   but what i don't know  is why you let the girl live   i wouldn't have killed the girl   not even if they paid me my quote   i told her anyone ever knew she was alive   i'd finish the job   i don't kill kids   had some punk on my cell block last week  say he heard i did   i told him the same thing   who hired you to do it   some guy i met one time   no names  cash   who hired you   guys who kill kids aren't popular in jail   solnick's been defending his honor   the people that hired him  may have found out he didn't kill theresa   maybe they hired somebody new to finish the job   why are they so worried about a teenager   i don't know   but we need to figure it out fast   oh  i think i may have a lead   whitaker was sole investor  in all his real estate deals except one   he bought a couple of parcels of landstor  with the real estate holding company landale   landale  send me the address   i'm on my way   landale financial  second floor    principal is a guy named calhoun   well  calhoun's got a lot of security  for a real estate developer   wait a second  who's this   i think i just found theresa's uncle derek   why would he turn up here   that's gonna have to wait   theresa just tried to sell those account numbers online   i'm tracing the ip address where she logged on   it's at 89th and west end   get moving   is it a wireless network   it is   maybe she's in one of the surrounding buildings   hey   you got me pretty good back there   not   not looking for a rematch   i know what happened to you and your family   i'm here to help you   just leave me alone   the man that killed your family's in jail   no one's gonna hurt you again   'cause i won't let them   you really shouldn't lie to kids   aah  ugh   theresa  are you gonna trust me now   i don't know you   you're gonna need to trust someone   don't worry   you're safe here   ordered you room service   it's a  50 cheeseburger   theresa   the man who came after you at the laundry mat   you ever see him before   do you have any idea who targeted your family   no   did it have anything to do with your uncle derek   is that why you didn't come to him   i don't trust him   why   what my dad said   before that man put a bullet in his head   he said it was derek's fault   hello   theresa  this is harold   and he's gonna stay with you   nice room   took the liberty of booking all four   your card   guess i can use the miles   theresa can't be left alone   here  i better take this   and  uh  this   i need you to stay here with harold   he'll take care of you   where are you going   i'm gonna pay a man a visit   i have the uncle's cell phone account   the gps signal is active   but he's not answering   landale's involved   i'm just not sure why they're still coming after her   don't dawdle   what the hell   what's the matter  derek   you don't want to talk to your dead brother   get in the truck   i'll drive   yeah  derek  we need to talk   i left you a couple messages  about the insurance guy who came by  asking questions   he wants to talk to you   something about grant's assets coming out of probate   i gave him your cell   anyway  call me back please   sometime this year   remember this place  derek   where they dumped your brother's whole family  in the water like chum   what are you talking about   i'm talking business  derek   landale financial  where you were yesterday   who the hell are you   that deal your brother grant made   greenpoint  bunch of land out in brooklyn  ruined by an oil spill   and now you're cutting a deal with him  aren't you   i tried to help grant   you helped him  all right   right into an early grave  with no will   which means that land goes into probate   and then to you  derek   let me ask you this   did you hire the hit man yourself   or did you let landale do it   i never meant for anyone to get hurt   grant  he swore that greenpoint was gonna be the big one   he just didn't have enough to cover all the parcels   so i told him i know these guys   calhoun  landale   it all looked legit   it was a front for dirty money   and you set your brother up with them   grant swore that it was gonna be a ten bagger  as soon as the government cleaned up the site   but  like everything with the government   it took too damn long   landale wanted their money immediately   so they took him out along with everyone in his family  just to get their money back out   they made me the administer of probate   that's the only reason why they didn't kill me   i'm supposed to sign it over to 'em next week   you know  the kicker is that grant was right   government came through  they cleaned up the site   now it's worth 20  30 times what they put into it   so that's why they're still coming after her   theresa is the legal heir to that property   theres   what are you talking about   she's dead   she's alive   no thanks to you   if you'd come forward  cleared your brother's name   she might not have spent the last two years hiding   from you   you know  i went to see your aunt elizabeth   she seems like a lovely person   you tell her about me   no  of course not   but she did mention how much she missed you   she even showed me an old photo   you know  there's no changing what happened to your family   but you do have someone out there that loves you   yeah  what do you know   i know what it's like to lose someone   and to feel the need to disappear   but  trust me  you don't want to leave people behind   when were you going to tell me   i wasn't gonna tell you  i guess   i'd rather i didn't know myself   all these people   and this damn machine knew   you knew     that someone wanted to harm them   kill them     and you did nothing   you knew what we were building here   this thing looks for plotters  for schemers   it looks for malicious intent   we built it to stop terrorists before they could act   but a machine doesn't understand the difference  between those crimes that are relevant to national security  and the ones that are irrelevant   irrelevant   so you taught it the difference   you want to play god  is that the deal   no  i don't  that's the whole point   there are exactly eight people in the world  that know that this thing exists   if anyone else ever found out   there'd be such an outcry    they'd turn it off   the intelligence the machine produces  has already foiled a half dozen major terrorist plots   how are we supposed to live with this   knowing that someone out there needs help   well  we don't have to   i've coded the machine   every night at midnight   it deletes the irrelevant list   we didn't build this to save somebody   we built it to save everybody   where's the girl   kid's worth a fortune  finch   land the father bought panned out fifty fold   and landale wants it all   killed the whole family   expected to clean up after it cleared probate   'til they found out the girl was still alive   do we know who ordered the hit   calhoun  the father's business partner   i've got eyes on him   and he's walking   so's theresa  got to go   wait  theresa   you know i can't keep up with you   can i ask you where you're going   i'm better off alone   and how's that   it's safer   i don't think so   please   sooner or later   you're gonna have to trust someone   you can't kill me   they need me   see     you have vastly overestimated your value in this process   they'll just hire another couple of lawyers   so   i'll ask you one more time   where's the girl   kiss my ass   can't tell you how much  we appreciate your patience and support on this  councilman   you're sure we're free and clear on this   rezoned for residential   hell  you can break ground as early as next month   jimmy calhoun   i got to hand it to

surveillance cameras   was there anyone else helping you   it was a pretty traumatic experience   i don't remember much at all            theresa   oh   are you looking for harold   is he taking another personal day   i don't think so  i was hoping you knew   maggie said he'd been transferred   but dave said he was laid off   he didn't even say goodbye   and here i was thinking  we were getting a little closer  harold   i told you i'm a very private person   well  you're gonna need to trust someone at some point   trust  that's not something i come by very easily   i have my reasons
