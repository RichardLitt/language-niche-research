it   detective kate beckett  nypd   we need to ask you a few questions  about a murder that took place earlier tonight   that's new   castle s01e01  mr  castle   you've got quite a rap sheet for a best selling author   disorderly conduct   uh  resisting arrest   boys will be boys   it says here that you stole a police horse   borrowed   ah  and you were nude at the time   it was spring   and every time  the charges were dropped   what can i say   the mayor is a fan   but if it makes you feel any better   i'd be happy to let you spank me   mr  castle  this whole  bad boy charm  thing that you've got going  might work for bimbettes and celebutantes   me  i work for a living   so that makes you one of two things in my world    either the guy who makes my life easier  or the guy who makes my life harder   and trust me  you do not want to be the guy who makes my life harder   okay   alison tisdale   daughter of real estate mogul jonathan tisdale     she's cute    she's dead   did you ever meet her  book signing  charity event   it's possible  she's not in my little black book   if that's what you're asking   what about this guy   marvin fisk  small claims lawyer   most of my claims tend to be on the  um  large side   so what's this got to do with me   fisk was found murdered in his office two weeks ago   i didn't put it together until we saw the tisdale crime scene tonight    flowers for your grave    and this is how we found marvin fisk   right out of  hell hath no fury    looks like i have a fan   yeah  a really deranged fan   oh  you don't look deranged to me   what    hell hath no fury     angry wiccans out for blood   come on  only hard core castle groupies read that one   do any of these groupies ever write you letters   disturbing letters   oh  all my fan mail is disturbing   it's an occupational hazard   because sometimes in cases like this  we find that the    killer attempts to     killer attempts to contact the subject of his obsession   i'm also pretty well versed in psychopathic methodologies   another occupational hazard   and do you know you have gorgeous eyes   so i take it that you won't have any objection to us going through your mail   knock yourself out   can i get copies of those   copies   i have this poker game  it's mostly other writers    patterson  cannell   you know  best sellers   you have no idea how jealous those would make them     jealous    that i have a copycat   oh  my gosh  in my world  that's the red badge of honor   that's the criminal cooperstown   people are dead  mr  castle   i'm not asking for the bodies  just the pictures   i think we're done here     i'm just a gal who cain't say no      i'm in a terrible fix      i always say   come on  let's go       just when i ought to      hey  kiddo   i'm just showing burt here how we did it at the palace   does he know it's your theme song   ready to bring it home  ducky   hey  yes   five  six  seven  eight     i'm just a fool when lights are low       you're missing the late show   i saw it in previews   looks like we got a new lead   his name is burt  he does magic     wow    yeah   let's hope he disappears by morning   c'est apres minuit dans une school night  don't you turn into a pumpkin or something   not when your dad's been escorted away by cops   how was the slammer  anyone make you their bitch   sorry  switchblade  still belong to you  baby bird     i already brushed    your loss   so are you gonna tell me about it or do i have to look it up on the fan sites   no  we had a deal  surf all the internet you want   stay off the fan sites   seriously  dad  are you in some kind of trouble   despite my best efforts  no   they want my help on a case   a case   apparently  someone's been killing people the way i kill them in my books     that's horrible    yeah   how many   two so far   are you okay   yeah  it's just so senseless   murder usually is   no  murder usually makes a great deal of sense    passion  greed  politics   what's senseless here is the books that the killer chose    hell hath no fury     flowers for your grave     my truly lesser works   why would a psychotic fan pick those   maybe because he's psychotic   come on  it's bedtime   you can figure it out in the morning     what are those    castle's greatest hits   you're gonna familiarize yourselves with all of his murder scenes  so we don't miss any   got any on tape   first victim  male lawyer   second victim   female social worker   somewhere in these books  those two are connected    from the library of katherine beckett    do you have a problem with reading  ryan   yo  check it  girl  you're totally a fan   right  of the genre   right  the  the genre  that's why you're blushing   what are you  12   profiling indicates a perp with low intelligence   someone who has or thinks he has a personal relationship with our author   so that's where we start   what   i work dead bodies all day   the last thing i want to do when i go home  is read murder books   aren't you curious   curious   about how people can do these kinds of things to one another   whoever did this read castle's books   and somewhere in those pages is the answer to where he'll strike next   okay   is all that castle's mail   his fans love him almost as much as he loves himself   can you take that back to briefing  please   did we hear back from the lab   yeah  scene was negative for d n a  and prints   just like fisk  the guy's careful   what about tisdale and fisk  any connection   other than your boy there  no   what's he doing here   maybe he likes you   detective beckett   captain   yes  sir   mr  castle's offered to assist with the investigation   really   it's the least i can do for the city i love   considering the nature of the crime scenes   i think it's a good idea   sir  can i talk to you for a minute  in private   nope   what   nothing   no  it's just  uh   the way your brow furrows when you're thinking    it's cute   i mean  not if you were playing poker   then it'd be deadly  but otherwise     can i ask you a question   shoot   why are you here   you don't care about the victims  so you aren't here for justice   you don't care that the guy's aping your books   so you aren't here 'cause you're outraged   so what is it  rick   are you here to annoy   i'm here for the story   the story   why those people  why those murders   sometimes there is no story   sometimes the guy is just a psychopath   there's always a story   always a chain of events that makes everything make sense   take you  for example   under normal circumstances  you should not be here   most smart  good looking women become lawyers  not cops   and yet  here you are  why   i don't know  rick   you're the novelist  you tell me   well  you're not bridge and tunnel   no trace of the boroughs when you talk   so that means manhattan  that means money   you went to college  probably a pretty good one   you had options   yeah  you had lots of options    better options  more socially acceptable options    and you still chose this   that tells me something happened   not to you   no  you're wounded  but you're not that wounded   no  it was somebody you cared about   it was someone you loved   and you probably could've lived with that   but the person responsible was never caught   and that  detective beckett  is why you're here   cute trick   but don't think you know me   the point is  there's always a story   you  you just have to find it   i think i just did   lab's got lifts off the letter   whose   the system's backlogged  it'll take a week to run a match   a week   welcome to reality  superstar   well  never did much like reality   mayor's office   hi  denise  it's rick castle     hi    yeah  is he in     hold on    thanks   like i said  the mayor's a fan   rick   yo  big cheese  it's ricky     you doing okay    yeah  of course     what's up    well  i don't know where you went   we looked all over for you  you took off with that girl   the man's got the mayor on speed dial   the rich really are different   you want himhe's yours   a control freak like you with something you can't control   no  no  that's gonna be more fun than shark week   okay  you will have your prints in an hour   mr  castle   half of the guys here are waiting for prints   you don't just jump the line   oh  i think somebody feels threatened     i am not threatened    no  no  i get it   i can call the mayor  and you can't   we have procedure  protocol   yeah  and you always come to a complete stop at a red light  and you never fudge your taxes   tell me something  do you ever have any fun   you know  let your hair down  drop your top   a little  cops gone wild    you do know i'm wearing a gun   beckett  midtown  they just found another one    death of a prom queen    maintenance found her an hour ago   kendra pitney  she lives in the building   all right  let's get her out of the water   um  you just stay here and don't touch anything   hi  i'm richard castle  i'm consulting   richard castle the author   on my better days   lanie parish  medical examiner  i love your books   you know  you have a real gift with the details of death   i thought i told you to stay over there   i got lonely   you got a c o d    not until the full exam  but this wasn't a stabbing   lack of blood around the wound  suggests she was dead before it was inserted   no foam around the mouth  so we know she didn't drown   oh  you're good   yeah  yeah  she was killed first and then posed   just like the others   yeah  i know  cai have a word   something wrong   this is a homicide investigation  not a day at disneyland   if i give you an order  i expect you to obey it   then you don't know me very well   you know  in my book  the dress was blue   stop trying to change the subject   did tisdale and fisk know each other   we haven't found a connection  why   what about motive   he's a serial killer  he doesn't need motive   beckett  okay   they got a match off the print   kyle cabot  he's in brooklyn  we got him     stay here    scout'shonor   kyle cabot  nypd  open up   kyle cabot  nypd   room clear  room clear   all clear   you should invite him to join your book club   beckett  you gotta see this   oh  that's creepy   i was never a scout   hey  beckett   alison's blouse   i'm guessing he kept trophies    22 caliber   show me your hands   hands in the air  let us see your hands  cabot  let me see your hands   he's still not speaking   state medical records indicate he's got pervasive developmental disorder   well  that explains his fixation with me   p d d  sometimes manifests in an obsession with a single subject   yeah  well  your superfan also has a history of delusions   guess who his caseworker was   alison tisdale   yeah   her files indicate that he was on pretty heavy antipsychotics   limited telligence  thinks he has a personal relationship with his hero    looks like your profile was right  detective beckett   so    what  that  that's it   what more do you want  evidence is in his apartment   we can connect him with the three victims    two from the diner where he worked   and tisdale was his social worker   call the d a  get him a legal aid     okay    i'm  that's  uh  it's too easy   the reader would never buy it   this isn't one of your books  castle   out here  we find a gustanding over a body with a gun   he's usually the guy who did it   you know this kid was in and out of the system for years   doesn't seem like he ever got the proper treatment  until alison tisdale took over his case file   she's the one who got him a job at the diner   and her notes seem to say heas doing okay   well  you can let the d a  worry about all that now   our job is done   yeah   hey  um  can you leave the box  i'll take care of it tomorrow   castle  i'm kinda glad that you killed off storm   less competition   mm   that's  20 to you  cannell   you're bluffin'  patterson   cough up some of that tv money and you'll find out   ah  bet's to you  ricky   castle     castle    hmm     bet's to you    oh  sorry   i know that look   story trouble   yeah  you never should've killed off storm   that was a big mistake  i w   i would've retired him   or crippled him  i mean  the man was money   you don't see me puttin' a bullet through alex cross' head   yeah  my boy shane scully's gonna be fueling my private jet  long after people have all forgotten about storm   oh  you know what  just for that  i am gonna call   so what's the problem  ricky   maybe we can help   i'm working on this thing  it starts with a famous author   some psycho starts staging murders like the way he does in his books   that's pretty self aggrandizing  isn't it   this is castle we're talking about   so    the crime scenes are clean   doesn't leave any fingerprints  doesn't leave any d n a   but the psycho writes the author a fan letter with his prints all over it   well  that leads the cops to his apartment   where they find enough evidence to convict him   and then     that's it    that's it   yeah  they arrest him   that's terrible  no wonder you're blocked   and here's another thing    the guy doesn't leave his prints at the scene of the crime   but he sends a letter with his prints on it   ahya lost me there     and what about a twist    yeah  where's the twist   yeah  right  like  uh    like  maybe somebody set this kid up   that's what your story needs    the character who thinks the kid's innocent   keeps digging until he finds the truth   oh  i have just the guy   what are you doing   it's a novelist's habit    poking through other people's mail   checking their medicine cabinets   why are you still here   i just came by to give you this   it's a little something to     memorialize our brief partnership   don't look so suspicious   go on  open it   i got you an advance copy   i even signed it to you   not that you're a fan   thanks  that's actually kind of     sweet     well      well     it was nice to have met you  detective beckett   he didn't   oh  he did   richard castle  you are under arrest for felony theft and obstruction of justice   you forgot making you look bad   you know  for a minute there   you actually made me believe that you were human   cuff him   ooh  bondage  my safe word is  apples    oh  there's no nd to be gentle   how'd you find me anyway   i'm a detective  that's what i do   my mother told you  didn't she   by the way  the rose petals in the tisdale murder   they're grandiflora  not hybrid teas   i'll make a note of it   yeah  you probably should since it means kyle cabot is innocent   thank you  officer     hello  father    hello  daughter   i wish i could say i was surprised   it's my fault  really  he never had a father figure   oh  that's not true  mother  i had lots of father figures   i see you've met captain montgomery and detective beckett   and they have agreed to drop the charges if you agree to behave   no more interference with this case  mr  castle   do we understand each other   yeah   but you still got the wrong guy   i    really   darling  must you always have to make a comment   nah  no  no  no  don't tell me that he got to you   please  he didn't get to me   she did   who  alison   marvin fisk  first murder  kyle knew him from the diner   and then he kills alison  his social worker   and then he kills kendra pitney  also from the diner   so   so he starts with a murder of convenience  and then escalates to a murder of somebody he knows very well  and then goes back to a murder of convenience   it doesn't make any sense   somebody set up kyle to take the fall   somebody who knew enough about his fixation with me  to use it to get away with murder   that means we're not looking for a serial killer   we're looking for a good  old fashioned murderer   someone with motive   you think the victims were somehow related   police would've found it by now   now if i were writing the story   the killer would've only wanted one of the victims dead   he would've killed the other ones just to cover up the crime   how do you get away with one murder by committing two more   at one death  you look for motive   at two  you look for a connection   at three  you look for someone like kyle   at three  you don't need motive   because mentally unstable serial killers don't usually have one   that makes about as much sense as  mousetrap    i did that play eight times a week for a year   i still have no idea what it's about   castle was right   if he was trying to follow his boo   then the roses on alison's body were wrong   and fisk should've been suffocated by a plastic bag   not strangled with a necktie   and kendra's dress should've been blue  not yellow   for an obsessive  it would've been impossible not to get the details right   well  if it wasn't him  then who was it   the killer had to have known both his intended victim and kyle fairly well   the only victim that had any real knowledge  of kyle's obsessive condition would've been alison tisdale   alison's the key  she's the one that the killer is trying to hide   well  as far as we know  she wasn't seeing anyone   and none of her other case profiles fit the profile   well  somebody had to know something about her   so if the killer found out about kyle through alison   then alison must've been the intended target   somebody wanted alison dead  we just have to figure out why   if i have to keep bailing you out   you're gonna need to raise my allowance     by a lot   mine  too   hi  i'm rick castle   i have an appointment to see mr  tisdale               is he now   this is not what it looks like  this  uh     okay  this is exactly what it looks like   but i can explain   you coming   did alison ever mention having enemies or being threatened   people loved her   all she wanted was to make the world a better place   i told all this to the other detective   i know  sir  we're just following up   did alison know anybody who could've profited from her death   mr  castle  i may be rich  but my daughter was not   she abhorred money   what little she had  she gave to charity   thank you  sir   mr  tisdale   fortune  magazine estimated your net worth at nearly  100 million   is that true   i don't check day to day   but it's in the ballpark   i've been lucky  yes   appreciate your time   wh what happens to all that money if something happens to you   castle   half of my estate goes to my charitable foundation   and the rest to my children   i mean  my son   thank you   what was that all about   he's dying   who's dying  tisdale   you want a hot dog  i want a hot dog   what do you take on your   aah  apples  apples  apples     what makes you think he's dying    okay     you see those pictures in his office    yeah   he's much thinner now  like sick thin  not workout thin   his daughter was just murdered   and the way he kept touching his hair  like he's self conscious   you think it was a piece   it's a good one  but it's new to him   the chemo's relatively recent   and he was wearing makeup   he's trying to look healthier than he is   doesn't want his shareholders to know   so he's got cancer  that doesn't mean that he's terminal   but it's a much better story if he is   you interview the brother   there was never a reason to   well  now there is     you got hot mustard    yeah     harrison tisdale    yeah   hey  mitch  let's get these pallets on the truck   detective kate beckett  rick castle   we'd like to ask you some questions about your sister   yeah  anything i can do  uh  let's head inside   last time i saw her  about a month ago at dad's   you know  i    still can't believe she's gone   were you close   ah  everybody loved her  i mean  my sister    she just wanted to see the best in people   even that kid who killed her   you know  she did everything she could to help that guy   even brought him around here once to see if i could get him a job   but you didn't   i can't afford to  all right   my employees mess up  i lose my bond   i don't know  maybe if i'd helped him     things would be different   how'd your sister react when yourad told you he was dying   she was upset   we both were   now that she's dead  your inheritance stands to double   what are you suggesting  you already caught the killer   yeah  we did  but the first thing his lawyers will do is shift suspicion to someone else   someone with motive   and then they'll stick me on the stand and ask me why i didn't investigate   and then the jury will have doubts   and we don't want them to have doubts  do we   no   so you'll have to excuse me for asking   but where were you the night of your sister's murder   i was traveling    on business   actually  i was out of the country for all three murders   here  check the stamps on that if it's useful   a u s  passport   absolutely unassailable   i was sure it was him   oh  don't take it so hard   after all  you're just a writer   what   nothing   what   oh  come on   he's lying   i mean  i get him knowing where he was the night of his sister's murder   but the other two victims   he didn't pause  he didn't ask for dates   he didn't even check his calendar   but he was ready with an alibi   in my experience  innocent people do not prepare alibis   so i was right   okay  give me the dates and flights   why can't you just admit i was right   because he totally fooled you  he totally bought the alibi   i had a fleeting moment of self doubt   so   his credit card company confirms he paid for three round trip tickets   dates coincide with the three murders   so according to his credit card  tisdale was out of the country   wait a minute  so now i'm not right   which means the passport stamps were forged   i'm gonna call passport control and have 'em check their logs   that's  uh  not how he would've done it   you got a better idea  ricky   second passport   and how would he get one of those   oh  with his money  trust me   on the black market  it would be a piece of cake   so he leaves the country on his own   comes back with the other passport  commits murder   flies out and then comes back in on his own   perfect alibi  perfect murder   but almost impossible to prove   unless you find the second passport   gotta be freaked after your little meet and greet   keep eyeballs on him  if he moves  i wanna know   the things that people will do for money   this guy killed his own sister in cold blood  and two more people to cover it up   he's either
