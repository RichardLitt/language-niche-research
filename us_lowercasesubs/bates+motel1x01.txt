1912   and my grandfather built that motel in the '50s   and that's my grandmother's rug   this property has been in my family for over a century   i'm sure it was very hard for you to lose it to the bank   and i'm very sorry  but  uh     well  it is ours now   i know everything about this place   every nook and cranny   every dirty secret   you don't know how this place works   this town   you know nothing about this town   what makes you think you can run this place by yourself   because i can   now get the hell off my property   and if i ever see you here again i will call the police   or i will shoot you myself   you're gonna call the police     get in  get in    go ahead  call the police   i go fishing with half of 'em   i grew up here  this is my house   so you're gonna call the
