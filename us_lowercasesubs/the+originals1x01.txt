handsome face  after a long journey   can i eat him  brother   elijah  i'd rather you didn't   there's no need to be afraid   he'll do exactly as i say   he'll remember nothing   i will remember nothing   we've had a very long journey  wherein which  unfortunately   we lost all of our crew   therefore  we'll ask you to kindly transport  our belongings to the shore   what kind of hell demons are you   we're vampires  darling   the original vampires     rebekah  elijah   our brothers kol and finn     may they rest in peace     klaus  are we saving the best for last   and our half brother niklaus   ignore him  he's a beast   ha ha     fled europe and survived the seas   would you rather i arrive hungry  on the shores of our new homeland   niklaus  your manners are  as always   without equal   sir  would you be so good as to tell us  where it is that we have arrived   the french colony of louisiana  off the shores of a town they've named new orleans   i thank you so much   oh  i do recommend that you find yourself  a little assistance for the luggage   my sincere apologies   sync   corrections by rafael upd  woman      this land is your land      this land is my land  so what brings you to the big easy   i used to live here   really  when   oh  feels like  i just moved here myself   what brought you back   well  my brother is here somewhere   i'm afraid he might have gotten himself  into a bit of a bind   you say that like it's a common occurrence   well  he's complicated       defiant  ill mannered  and a little temperamental   see  we don't share the same father   of course  that never bothered me   but my brother resents it deeply   never felt like he belonged   all told  he has a long history  of getting himself into trouble   well  i'm guessing you have a long history  of getting him out of it   what kind of bind is your brother in   he believes there are people in this town  that are conspiring against him   wow  narcissistic and paranoid   sorry   bartender with a grad degree in psychology   total cliche   listen  camille   i'm looking for someone who might shed some light  on his current predicament   she works here    jane anne deveraux   any idea where i might find her   no  but i know someone who might   welcome to new orleans  and the crown jewel of the crescent city   the french quarter     jazz and jambalaya  romance and poetry   not to mention things that go bump in the night   monsters that feed off human blood   vengeful spirits of the dead   and  my personal favorite  the witches   here we have voodoo shop jardin gris   come in  browse for a hex   are you gonna continue following me  elijah   or do you want to talk   you know who i am   original vampire  always wears a suit   you and your family are famous amongst the witches   especially with your brother back in town   well  niklaus is here because he learned  that a witch was conspiring against him   someone by the name of jane anne deveraux   well  if he's looking of jane anne   he's a little late   are you telling me she's dead   come on   her sister sophie is gonna want to talk to you     that's jane anne   killed in public for anyone to find   only people who come around here  are the witches   now her sister has come to take her body   her spirit can't rest until it's been  properly interred in the cemetery   please tell me that my brother  had nothing to do with this   no  jane anne died because she got caught doing magic   what do you mean  she got caught doing magic     you want to know who killed jane anne   you're about to get your first glimpse  of marcel in action   the vampire marcel   things have changed since your family left   and marcel has changed   i'm asking you  stay hidden   if marcel finds out that a witch  let the originals back into town   my people will be slaughtered   well  well  well  what have we here   i got to tell you  soph  this street corner  is not proving the luckiest spot  for your family tonight     not half an hour ago  we had to teach  your sister a little lesson  we're putting her to rest  marcel   leave us alone   i never said you could move the body   matter of fact  i left her here for a reason   send a message   if anybody is thinking of joining some kind  of rebellion  my rules state  that witches can't practice magic in the quarter   and yet a little birdie informed me  that jane anne was cooking up  something magically delicious   oh  yeah   while i have you  quick q a   my old friend the hybrid klaus   he just happened to show up out of the blue  asking for  of all people  jane anne   any idea why  i don't know   witches don't get involved in vampire business   mm  that would be pretty stupid   that's for sure   tell you what   go back to the restaurant   cook up some of that famous gumbo  and keep those tourists happy   take the body   no  stop  stop  marcel     i'm gonna hold on to your sister's body  in case maybe you remember why klaus is here   sophie  marcel  please   her body won't be at peace       not my problem  rebekah  you mean to tell me  after all these years   marcel is alive and well   elijah  quite   our brother seems to have wandered into a war zone   and i haven't been able to find him   marcel  who klaus sired and brought up  beneath his own wing  now rules a menagerie  of savage vampires running wild   killing in public for any human to come upon   witches are held in subjugation   i doubt niklaus had any idea  what he was walking into   sorry  what was that   i stopped paying attention  at  our brother   rebekah     our hateful  traitorous bastard  of a brother negated any sympathy  i once had for him by his repeated efforts  to ensure neither you nor i know happiness  outside of his own selfish universe   always and forever  rebekah   that is what we once swore to each other   consider this me calling take backs   oh  you've called take backs dozens of times  over the centuries  and yet when our father  found us and chased us from this very city     i may be old  elijah  but i'm hardly senile   i know very well i stuck with klaus   and not 3 years later  he stuck a silver dagger  in my chest and sent me into a magical slumber  for 90 years   do you know why   because i had the audacity to try  and live my life on my own without him   no  i believe our brother is in trouble   so whatever is going on between marcel and the witches   it's dire enough that they'd risk  bringing an original back to town   the witches have lured him here   i'd like to know why     oh  you got me into this  jane   oh  give me the strength to finish it       the doors work  you know   man  you're doing magic   i'm praying to my dead sister   go ahead  pay your respects   don't make this a thing  sophie   the hybrid was looking for jane anne   marcel wants to know why   i'd say ask her yourself  but i guess you can't  see   because marcel killed her     i'm elijah   have you heard of me   yes   so why don't you tell me  what business your family has with my brother         this is sacred ground   which means vampires have to be invited in     but since i'm desperate  come on in   we can talk freely here   then i suggest you start talking   what did your sister want with niklaus   isn't it obvious   we have a vampire problem  and we need help   marcel has an army backing him   the witches have been trying to fight back   we haven't had much luck  until my sister jane anne met a girl   a werewolf passing through the quarter  from a small town in virginia   she had a special connection to your brother   what kind of connection   apparently  they spent some time together   one thing led to another   and now this special werewolf girl   she's pregnant  and the father  of the child she's carrying  is your brother klaus   it's impossible   nothing is impossible  especially not  when it comes to your brother   think about it   they call him the hybrid  right   bring her out   who the hell are you   give us a moment  please   so have they been holding you here  against your will   they lured me out to the bayou  and grabbed me   then they did all these weird  witchy tests   not that i understand how this could happen   i mean  vampires are dead   they can't have children   perhaps if you knew my brother's story   it might explain how this is possible   here  if i may     what are you doing  relax   if you open your mind to me   i can show you   in the beginning  our family was human    come on  henry   our brothers are fighting again   elijah  voice over  although our mother  dabbled in the dark arts   we were largely just a family trying to survive  at a time when it was quite difficult to do so     and  for better or worse   we were happy   that is  however  until one night   our youngest brother was killed  by our village's greatest threat   mother   elijah  voice over  men that could transform themselves  into wolves during the full moon   our family was devastated   none more than niklaus   desperate to protect the rest of us   our father forced our mother to call  upon her black magic in order to make us stronger   drink   drink   thus  the first vampires were born   but with this speed  this strength   this immortality came a terrible hunger   no one felt this hunger more than niklaus   when he killed for the first time   he knew what he truly was   aah  aah   aah   what is happening to me   no  don't  don't   klaus  father  no  it hurts   aah   he's a beast  an abomination     he wasn't just a vampire   he was also a werewolf   that's how the werewolf curse works   isn't activated until you take a life   niklaus was the result of an indiscretion  our mother had hidden from us all   an affair with a werewolf like yourself   elijah  voice over  infuriated by this betrayal   my father forced our mother to cast a spell that would  suppress klaus' werewolf side  denying him any connection  with his true self   ah     elijah  elijah  hold him down   brother  please don't let them do this to me   do it now  boy  now   help me   your dad was a dick   i'm hayley  by the way   you should probably know my name  if you're gonna tell me your whole life story   i mean  i know yours   your family is legendary   your brother is a notorious psycho  who i slept with  classic me   i cannot excuse his behavior   but you must understand  that our father hunted him   hunted us for centuries   every time we found a moment of happiness   we were forced to flee  even here in new orleans   where we were happiest of all   not long after niklaus broke the spell  which prevented him from becoming a hybrid   he defeated our father   i thought this would make him happy   but he's angrier than ever   elijah  i wonder if  perhaps  this baby  will be a way from my brother to find happiness   a way to save him from himself   sophie  i'm glad you feel that way  because we need your help   what  precisely  is it that you want   what does it have to do with this girl   we want to run marcel and his vampires  out of town   klaus is the key   everything marcel knows about being a vampire  he learned from klaus   marcel trusts him  looks up to him   he won't see the betrayal coming   yes  well  as i'm sure you're aware   my brother niklaus doesn't like to be told what to do   it's why i brought you here   marcel drove the werewolves out of town  decades ago   do you really think he's going to welcome  a hybrid baby to the neighborhood   convince klaus to help us   and no one has to know about the newest member  of the original family   sounds remarkably like blackmail   like i said  i'm desperate   well  then   i have my work cut out for me  don't i     evening  elijah   niklaus   what an entirely unwelcome surprise   and what an entirely unsurprising welcome   come with me   i'm not going anywhere till i find out  who's conspiring against me   i believe i just found that out for you   no  it's impossible   i said the same thing myself   this is a lie  you're all lying   vampires cannot procreate   but werewolves can   magic made you a vampire   but you were born a werewolf   you're the original hybrid   the first of your kind  and this pregnancy  is one of nature's loopholes   you've been with someone else  admit it   hey  i've spent days held captive  in a freaking alligator bayou  because they think that i'm carrying  some magical miracle baby   don't you think i would've fessed up  if it wasn't yours   my sister gave her life to perform the spell  she needed to confirm this pregnancy   because of jane anne's sacrifice   the lives of this girl and her baby  are now controlled by us   we can keep them safe   or we can kill them  if you don't help us take down marcel   so help me  hayley won't live long enough  to see her first maternity dress   hayley  wait  what   elijah  enough of this   if you want marcel dead  he's dead   i'll do to myself  no   we can't  not yet   we have a clear plan that we need to follow   and there are rules   how dare you command me   threaten me with what you  wrongfully perceive to be my weaknesses   this is a pathetic deception   i won't hear any more lies   niklaus     listen     kill her and the baby   what do i care   screw this  i'm out of here   no one touches the girl  i will fix this   elijah  niklaus   it's a trick  elijah   no  brother  it's a gift   it's your chance  it's our chance   to what   to start over  take back everything we lost   everything that was taken from us   niklaus  our own parents came to despise us   our family was ruined   we were ruined  and since then   all that you have ever wanted   all that we have ever wanted  was a family   i will not be manipulated   so they're manipulating you   so what   with them    this girl and her child   your child    live   i'm gonna kill every last one of them   and then what   then you return to mystic falls  to resume your life as the hated one   as the evil hybrid   is it so important to you that people quake with fear  at the sound of your name   people quake with fear because i have the power  to make them afraid   what will this child offer me   will it guarantee me power   family is power  niklaus   love  loyalty  it's power   this is what we swore to one another 1 000 years ago  before life tore away what little humanity  you had left  before ego  before anger   before paranoia created in this person before me  someone i can barely even recognize as my own brother   this is us   the original family     and we remain together always and forever   i am asking you to stay here   i will help you  and i will stand by you   i will be your brother   we will build a home here together   so save this girl   save your child   no   marcel and his vampires are out of control   something had to be done   and the solution is to bring in more vampires   these aren't just any vampires  agnes   they're the originals   what makes you think you can control the hybrid   elijah  she can't   not entirely certain that i can  either   but now that your coven has drawn his ire   i have a question   what prevents my brother from murdering you  instead of cooperating    ow   what the hell   the spell my sister performed   the one that got her killed   it didn't just confirm the pregnancy   it linked me to hayley   so anything that happens to me  happens to her  which means her life is in my hands   klaus may not care about his own child   but it's very clear what it already means to you   if i have to hurt hayley or worse to ensure  that i have your attention  i will   you dare threaten an original   i have nothing to lose   you have until midnight  to get klaus to change his mind     hey  man  where'd you run off to   oh  someone put you in a mood   what can i do   what you can do is  you can tell me what  this thing is you have with the witches   you know i owe you everything i got   but i'm afraid i have to draw the line on this one   this is my business   i control the witches in my town   let's just leave it at that   your town  damn straight   ha  that's funny because when i left  you were just  a pathetic  little scrapper still trembling  from the lashes of the whips  of those who would you keep you do   and now look at you    master of your domain   prince of the city   i'd like to know how  why   jealous   hey  man  i get it   you helped build  a backwater penal colony into something   you started it  but then you left   actually  you ran from it   i saw it through  look around   vampires rule this city now   i got rid of the werewolves   i even found a way to shut down the witches   the blood never stops flowing   and the party never ends   you want to pass on through   you want to stay a while   great  what's mine is yours   but it is mine    my home   my family  my rules   and if someone breaks those rules   they die   mercy is for the weak   you taught me that  too   and i'm not the prince of the quarter  friend   i'm the king   show me some respect   you're friend will be dead by the weekend   which means i've broken one of your rules   and yet a cannot be killed   i am immortal   who has the power now  friend   elijah  he's willing to give up everything   come on  elijah   does that really surprise you   i can already see it  he's spiraling   he's lashing out in blind rage   you know  the last time i saw him like this   it lasted 200 years   then leave him to his temper tantrum  and come home   with any luck  this misadventure  will allow us a reprieve from all of his insanity   it was so close   when he heard the baby's heartbeat   i could see it in his eyes   he wanted it   he could almost taste happiness   and now his temper has destroyed it   even if i was to return him to sanity   he just lost marcel's trust   so i'm almost out of time to get the girl   get her   have you lost your mind   are we running an orphanage now   say what you will about niklaus   but on my life   i'm not letting anything happen to that baby   you find him  and then you call me   don't worry  i know how to deal with klaus   elijah  is that so  please elaborate   elijah mikaelson   no  i got it  it's all good   it's time we had a little chat   well  if you're gonna talk  talk   i got things to do   oh  my  you have grown quite confident  over the last century  haven't you   me  i'd say it's you and your brother got cocky   come to my town like you own the place   well  we did own the place once   we were all quite happy here  as i recall   but we could never control  those pesky witches at the french quarter   how do you do it   hmm  brother asked me the same question   i gave him the same answer  it's my business   everything in the quarter is my business   klaus comes into town all nice and friendly   then he starts looking down his nose at what i done  like it's some cheap knockoff  of one of his dumb paintings   then he gets pissed off like a little bitch  and bites one of my guys   well  i do apologize for klaus' poor behavior   i assume you know that that bite  will kill your friend within a matter of days   of course  niklaus' blood would cure him   what  yes   apparently  the blood of the hybrid  will cure a werewolf bite   quite a handy  little thing  when one needs leverage a negotiation   what kind of negotiations we talking about   return the body of the witch jane anne   allow her people to put her to rest   what do you care about the witches   well  that's my business  now  isn't it     his time is up   what are you gonna do now  sophie   i'm gonna do what i said i was gonna do   woman  what  kill the girl  kill yourself   klaus does not care about the child   elijah  i do     and i bring proof  of my intent to help you     the body of your fallen friend   which i procured from marcel himself   oh  jane anne   may she be granted peace   klaus will agree to your terms   i just need a little more time   you had your time  it's passed   shut up  agnes   for now  accept the deal   the girl and the child remain unharmed   or klaus will kill you all     and i will help him     have i not made clear my desire to be left alone   oh  you demand to be left alone  at least once a decade   your words have ceased to have impact   why must you keep harping on about the baby   that child will never be born   in fact  hayley is probably dead already   you will not walk away from this   let me go  no   don't make me say it again   i will not let you go  i will never let go   even if i have to spend eternity  saving you from your own stubborn  petulant   vile self   if i have to beat you as father used to beat you  to remind you of your own humanity   to care about anything     you're beyond pathetic  elijah   who's more pathetic   the one who sees hope to make his family whole     or the coward  who can only see the world through his own fear   i haven't cared about anything for centuries   why on earth do you   because i failed you   because the first time our father laid a hand on you   i should've struck him dead   and i made a promise to you     always  forever family above all   ha ha ha   ha ha ha   you are a sentimental fool   perhaps   i've lasted this long in spite of it  haven't i   elijah  voice over  the bond of family blesses us  with an immeasurable power     elijah  voice over  but we also must accept what comes with it   it gives us a responsibility to love without condition     without apology   we can never waiver from the power of that bond   even when it is tested   the bond nourishes us  gives us strength   without that power  we have nothing   this town was my home once  and in my absence   marcel has got everything i ever wanted     power  loyalty  family   i made him in my image  and he has bettered me   i want what he has   i want it back   i want to be king   elijah  so is that all this child means to you   a grab for power   what does it mean to you   i think this child  can offer you the one thing  that you've never believed you had   and what's that   the unconditional love of family   tell sophie deveraux we have a deal     you all right   just dust   this place is ancient   yes  it should serve our purposes   it's a sanctuary from our business in the quarter   right now  you're the most important person  in this family   you need a good home   so i'm curious   in all this time  has anyone  asked you how you feel   about having a miracle baby  with a psychotic one night stand   about being a mother   i     i was abandoned when i was born   and my adoptive parents kicked me out  the second that i turned into a wolf   so i don't really know  how i feel about being a mother  because i never really had a good one   i will always protect you   you have my word on that   klaus  and noble elijah always keeps his word   is it done   as a matter of fact  yes   your underhanded deal worked quite well   marcel was only too happy to accept my blood   even as he accepted my heartfelt apologies   his man thierry yet lives   and i remain a welcome guest in the french quarter   my own concern now  is this coven of impudent witches   i believe them to be honorable   they did release hayley   though they haven't been entirely forthcoming   marcel obviously has something  that they need   they don't want him dead   there must be a reason why     i assume it's all quiet out there   the witches know better than to use magic   they know i can sense it when they do   what about the old ones   they're dangerous   and i don't want them to hurt you   the originals   davina  as powerful as you are   they don't stand a chance   in addition to the secret weapon  he uses to control the witches   marcel has assembled a small army of vampires   working together  we could destroy them from the inside   and what of rebekah   has she stopped her pouting long enough  to join the fun   she has made her disinterest quite clear   one too many times daggered  and shoved in a box  i gather   or perhaps she doesn't share  your unwavering belief that i can be saved   rebekah may surprise us yet   after all  we all swore the same vow   i hope she stays far away  because in my desire to reclaim this town   to steal from marcel that which he holds  most dear  i have realized  one massive vulnerability   one weakness that marcel could exploit   and what is that   you   waah  uh   uh   forgive me  my brother   there is no power in love   mercy makes you weak  family makes you weak   if i'm ever going to win this war   i have to do it alone
