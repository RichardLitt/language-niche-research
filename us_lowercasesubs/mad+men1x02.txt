 two eggs are better   tell the  uh  lieutenant  please   that things are getting a little dry around code 29   am i wrong   all clear in no man's land   roger  you've expressed your desire for another drink   no need to take the orders   right away  sir   wine list   and i'll have another one of these while i'm waiting for the list   another egg   well  i am having fried chicken   as long as the egg comes first   my nanny  belva  made fried chicken   i used to take it to school wrapped in wax paper   his sweet belvedere  he really loved that woman   had another nanny originally  german girl   round face  enormous bosom   my parents got rid of her after the lindbergh baby   we thought about getting a nanny   we have a girl that comes in as sort of a house keeper  and sometimes babysitter   i let her take the children to play group   sometimes the park   belva raised me   i turned out just fine   didn't have to go to a psychiatrist  like some people's kids   oh  what's the big deal   margaret is practically the last girl  in our building to go   sixteen years old  wouldn't get out of bed   i tell ya  i can not wait until that girl  is another man's problem   what about you  don  did you have a nanny   i can't tell you about my childhood   it'll ruin the first half of my novel   don doesn't like to talk about himself   i know better than to ask   an add man who doesn't like to talk about himself     i think i may cry   it's not that interesting a story   just think of me as moses   i was a baby in a basket   to moses and don draper     couple of princes   if the gentleman will be patient   i'll join you   i think i may know more about your wife  than i do about my own   maybe your wife is just a better drinker   entirely possible   mona  can you help me here   i've seem to grow a set of thumbs   do you ever have that when your hands go numb   want me to touch you up   i think you'll have to   look at those lips   i bet it's not hard for you  to hold on to a man like that   don't smile  it'll make it harder   it's hard to hold on to anything right now  with the children and running the house   i don't know if i told you   but my mother died three months ago   i'm sorry     there are other ladies waiting to use the mirror   those purses get any smaller   we're gonna starve   i loved seeing you like that   well  you were sitting on my good side   no  i mean  the way other people see you   when you're with strangers you know exactly what you want   well  i'd like to think i always know what i want   um  slow down   i have to put that in my diary   lobster  newberg  and gimlets should get a divorce   they're not getting along very well   once you rounded the corner on number two   i took it for a case of nerves   he's your boss   he likes you   toujour means he likes me   when he gets us to the four seasons   then we'll know he trusts me   he seemed very forth coming   he was stoned on martinis   i don't know     it all seemed like an invitation to to confide   well  maybe it's just manners   but i was raised to see it as a sin of pride  to go on like that about yourself   you're so reverent   did you have a nanny   i've never asked you that   why  what difference does it make   i don't know  we've never talked about it   did you   no  of course not   so your mother and your father are responsible  for all this   i'll have to thank them someday   jesus  bets  it's like politics  religion   or sex     why talk about it   i see your point   who's in there   peggy  next step is accessories    35 a week minus 6 75 for fica   can you believe it   maybe it's the fumes from the rubber cement on that envelope   but there's nothing to be happy about here   although  you never forget your worth   for two weeks  i've been telling people  i have a job in manhattan   look at you  you're indomitable   you'd never know you were the very bottom of the food chain   bridget  are you okay   thanks to the precision valve corporation  for the next 18 months   gillette is the only company on earth  that can spray deodorant out of a can   modern deodorant for a modern man   he prefers jet travel to train travel   vodka scotch   and likes to get his news from the radio  not the paper   harold hill  give it a rest   oh  do not puncture or incinerate     sounds dangerous   hey  i got a dud   how is it a guy as big as you  ken   has no basketball skills   i'm sure more research is need   you should try it out   who smells bad in here   oh no  come on   come on  kenny   knock it off   just pretend it's prom night   you can be the girl   stop   all right  close your eyes   mr  draper  i was buzzing you   mr  cooper is waiting   i always thought it was sterling who was responsible  for the navy attitude around this place   brazerre account     just figured out we can't sell 'em to men   so much yarn  so little time   so roger mentioned this nixon thing   yeah  he mentioned it   i just assumed it went away   it didn't   the last i read  nixon was running without an agency   make no mistake   we know better what dick nixon needs     better than dick nixon   and what does dick nixon think he needs   what he already has    ted rogers   brains behind that checkers broadcast   see the problem   he dodged a financial scandal by standing  with his wife and begging for his dog   an admission wrapped in a distraction     i'd say they know what they're doing   dogs are winners   well  they think they're set without us   why chase a girl that doesn't want to get caught   you have a problem with nixon   i don't vote   hear hear   but politics aside these last eight years  have been good to us because they've been good  to proctor and gamble and united fruit company  etcetera   so whether dick nixon likes it or not     we will give our people what they want  agreed   i said cut it out   be my pleasure   goodie   assemble a team  start files on contenders   simington  kennedy     who knows  maybe eleanor roosevelt will throw  her feed bag into the ring   don  you still on for lunch   no   don't tell me that's lunch   i've got a lot of work to catch up on   i do that sometimes  saunter over to

 niagara falls    greetings from the wettest place on earth    i say we skip lunch all together  and try on those narrow sweater sets  i saw at lord and taylor   do you want me to sit outside the dressing room  and hold your purse   what he's trying to say is  can we buy you lunch   i don't know  we hadn't planned on eating   come on  three on two   i know you all like to be out numbered  it's

merely browsing   she's browsing   and like most of us she's disappointed  with the selection of merchandise   perhaps  i can interest you in a 42 long   that's not his suit size   she blushes   no i don't   you know  maybe i shouldn't tell you this   but you are the subject of much debate   money riding on the outcome   money for me   now there's even a third possibility     paying you   we should be getting back   i'll get the check   my goodness  thank you for lunch  boys   yes  thank you   hmm  take the rest of the afternoon off   we could go to the zoo   see what the animals are up to   um     i should get back to work  or shopping   guess you don't seeing any money changing hands  kenny   you'll see    my persistence is my charm   that was delicious   you enjoy yourself with the hitler youth   oh  well it was kind of last minute     easy    see that draper takes a look at these   certainly   you can look too   three of the last pta presidents  are from the kindergarten class   i say you go in there and lay some ground work   i will not have marilyn keckner dictate the agenda   the woman is obsessed with nutrition   although  you wouldn't know it to look at her   francine  you're terrible   i ran into juanita cabet at square dancing  and i found out who's moving into  that little dutch colonial down the street   who   her name is helen bishop   is she an old lady   divorced   really   nine year old boy and a baby   that's awful   i know   all on her own   i know   can you imagine worrying about money  at this point in our lives   well  obviously  that's not the worst of it   no   no  it isn't   it is too quiet in there   ernie   sally   we're playing space man   sally draper come over here this minute   if the clothes from that dry cleaning bag  are on the floor my closet   you're going to be a very sorry young lady   make sure your brother hasn't climbed out of the play yard   juanita it might be bad for real estate value  and she'll mark     one divorcee   bobby   oh my god   are you okay   what's that   what   that   oh  that's a television   since when do you have a television   i don't know   i think it's been about ten days   it's been so amazing i sort of lost track   i seem to remember a woman  wasting a good piece of a beautiful afternoon  reciting this diatrave against television  that should've ended with her banging her shoe on the table   don darling if you wanna ask the question   just ask it   where'd you get the tv   i got it   same place you got that wig   someone gave it to me   and you took it   have you seen this thing called  people are funny    oh jesus  don   all better   yes   sit at your places   daddy   we went to the hospital   we got lollipops   they're fine  don   what about you   a little sore   a little embarrassed   sorry they couldn't get ahold of me   we had to carry freddy rumsen out of ratazys   oh there was nothing you could've done   daddy  use a fork   how's the car   not bad   uh  thank god i was only going 25 tops   i hate the way you drive  you know   i'm finished  can i go watch shirley temple story book   yes  both of you   so what happened   i don't know really   it all happened so fast   at 20 an hour  it's not that fast   it's stupid   was it sally playing with the radio again   i've warned her  no  she was fine   she was just sitting there no   it was my hands   it happened again   jesus   betty you have to get this taken care of   that doctor patterson is not through   i swear when we walk down park avenue   i could hear the quacking   i know you said that   this doctor was nice   he was older actually   he was from rochester   has two children that are ten years apart   okay  you've given me his credentials   what did he say   well he said i could go to new york  and run the di tests   and i said that i already had  and that the results were negative  and he even called doctor patterson   so   they said there was nothing physically wrong with me   then i told him what happened  and he said that i should see a psychiatrist   doctors must love that they now have an answer  for i don't know what's wrong   he said it could be a nervous condition   nervous about what    driving   so we'll go down to he grand union parking lot   we'll practice your 10 00 and 2 00   he seemed very concerned if you wanna know   but that's their solution   why not open the hood and poke around   so   so    i left   what else am i supposed to do   well go to a doctor  another doctor a good one   i'll get a specialist from burt cooper   his name's on a wall over at saint vincents   okay   and leave the dishes for the girl   seven     eight     nine     ten     eleven     twelve     ninety eight     ninety nine     one hundred   you know i do worry about you  burty   i know   when you brought it up i was shocked   although i realized that  that's what doctor patterson  was trying to say in his own way and     it doesn't have as much of a sigma today   i just don't know what they can possibly tell you   doyouthink i need a psychiatrist   i always thought people saw psychiatrists  when they were unhappy     but i look at you     and this     and them     and that     and i think  are you unhappy   of course i'm happy   well that'll be 35 dollars    you're welcome   whatever you think is best   good   act of god    sorry   someone threw themselves in front of the train   ah  suicide   okay  boys     what do we have   gentlemen  the aerosol can is nothing less than space age   it's steel  it has exhaust     it's even shaped like a rocket   certainly an engineering marvel   right guard    it works in my suit    or yours    we'll punch the yellow of the moon so it pops behind him   we're looking for new worlds   and with that search comes any number of gadgets   it's not just some random association   this thing is shiny   it's explosive   it's from the future    a place so close to us now   filled with wonder and ease   except some people think of the future  and it upsets them   they see a rocket  they start building a bomb shelter   what  how do you get there   i don't think it's ridiculous to assume  we're looking for other planets  because this one will end   i thought we had something here   who is this moron flying around space   i mean  he pees in his pants   brass tacks    who buys this   some woman   your girl or your mother will pick this up  walking through the grocery store or the druggist   we should be asking ourselves  what do women want    i don't know  but i wish i had it   maybe a chesty alien girl  also wants to get into his suit   i'm not asking what do women want  in some bull crap research psychology way   i'm asking  what would make a woman look  at this man's deodorant and say   i want that    well  i've stopped trying to figure out what they think   maybe i should stop paying you   well  i always thought women liked the way we smell   that explains a lot   i feel like we're close here   i mean  this one   the can's right side up but the guy's upside down   no   let's bring it down to earth   you think they want a cowboy   he's quiet and strong   he always bring the cattle home safe   you watch tv   what if they want something else   inside  some     mysterious wish that we're ignoring   how'd it go   i've still got my novel   i'm sorry   buy me lunch   samuel  that drape  man  it's sadder than a map   well  it's lightweight and it tells me i'm at work   but you sure can talk  mr  kensey   sixty cents   what are you doing   keep the change   you figure the place out yet   what do you mean   how it runs   i know the copywriters tell the art department what to do   and i know the account executives tell the copywriters what to do   what   no one tells the writers what to do  except for the head of creative    your boss   it's all on draper   don't think that just 'cause he's good looking  he's not a writer   dig   this is the media department   they're where 90  of where the client's check goes   they buy space    newspapers  billboards  television   and my favorite aging whore  radio   that's the whole shakedown  actually   all you really need to know   they don't sell ideas or campaigns or jingles   they sell media    at a 15  markup   creative is just window dressing  it's thrown in for free   really   accounting    they keep track of how much we're spending  versus how much we're taking in   and since we're buying futures   if you ever  ever see  um   the man upstairs go in there   grab the lifeboats  baby    we're going down   account management   where prep schoolers skip arm in arm    wizard of oz  style  joined together  by their lack of skill and their love of mirrors   account executives are all good at something   although it's never advertising   submitted for your approval   one peter campbell   a man who recently discovered  that the only place for his hand  is in your pocket   you watch it   have you seen it     the twilight zone    i don't think so  i don't like science fiction   i'm gonna pretend you didn't say that   mitch in media says cbs might pull the plug   i'll kill myself   and here we have the creative department   the talent  home sweet home   like the art department downstairs   they put us far enough away from the elevator  so we can't sneak out   you know  there are women copywriters     good ones    sure   i mean  you     you can always tell when a woman's writing copy   but sometimes she just might be the right man  for the job  you know   you must be very creatively satisfied   let's not lose our heads   sterling coop is positively cro magnon   i have a friend    i'm not even gonna say what agency     but all they do is smoke mary jane and play darts   and honestly  i think they're the best store on the street   you like ukrainian food   oxtail dumplings   we still have a lot of work to do   i think he's still in there   ah  got it   thanks for lunch   sorry about your copy   thanks for reminding me   i can never get used to the fact that  most of the time it looks like you're doing nothing   fix you something    close enough   coop is gonna want a carbon  with your hand picked team for nixon on it   and i warn you right now  it includes pete campbell   i should go to niagara falls for two weeks   it does wonders for your career   niagara falls   boy  redefines lack of imagination   ahh  that's where you've been   let me ask you something   what do women want   who cares   you mentioned the other night  that your daughter had been to a psychiatrist   i'm sure you must be mistaken about that   you know what   i am very comfortable with my mind   thoughts clean and unclean  loving and     the opposite of that   but i am not a woman   and i think it behooves any man to toss  all female troubles into the hands of a stranger   we had one head shrinker in the army   a gossip   busting with other people's thoughts   hasn't changed much  just costs more   you can't shoot at them   we live in troubling times   we do   who could not be happy with all of this   jesus  you know what they want   everything   especially if the other girls have it   trust me  psychiatry is just this year's candy pink stove   it's just more happiness   people     are     funny   beauty and the beast   hey  daddy   hey there  cold lamb sound good   yeah   someone started on a train   in the office   because of a good day or a bad day   you know  when i told you you had everything     i was wrong   oh my god   white gold   it's got one of those tiny little faces that you have to be young to see   oh  don its beautiful   the guy at the store set the time  but he was english so it might be six hours off   did you look at sally's face   i think she has a bruise   i didn't see it   on her cheek bone under her eye   i thought that was ketchup   what if she had gotten a scar    something permanent   i don't wanna play  what if    i'm just saying   if it had happened to bobby it would've been okay  because a boy with a scar is nothing  but a girl    so much worse   nothing happened   i keep  thinking     not that i could've killed the kids but     worse   sally could've survived  and gone on living with this  horrible scar on her face and     some long  lonely   miserable life   don     what's happening to me   do i need to see someone   i don't know   i guess so   whatever you want    brought betty into the city to see the doctor but  uh   honestly i think i'm the one not feeling so great   i called in sick   don't bring that here   i'm serious  don  don't talk to me about her   that makes me feel cruel   you're right   sometimes   i can't decide if you have everything     or nothing   i live in the moment   nothing is everything   it sounds more like you live in the village   actually i live in the hall   i lost my key   i had to  um     spend the night abroad   could you be a gentlemen  and break into the fire escape  so i don't have to   is draper in yet   he's not coming in today  he's not feeling well   i'm leaving  don't tell anyone i was here   no it's  peggy   hello   i don't think i can go out to lunch today   mr  draper's not coming in   that means you can go out to lunch   have you never worked in an office before   he could call   it's my second week another time   i did enjoy the tour the other day   it was eye opening   i didn't think your eyes could be any wider   that's clever   i guess i'll go to the cart  you want something   what   the office is gonna empty out any second   we could push the couch in front of the door   paul   do you belong to someone else   shit   i don't even like to sit in dons chair   i think we've misunderstood each other   there is someone else  right   yes   i hope you know that covering your typewriter's  office code for i'm done for the day   i'm not feeling so swell   neither am i  look at these letters you typed after lunch   taraho indiana has two  r's   and an  a  and an  e  at the end   i gather you missed homerow by a hand  or you were out drinking with the junior account boys again   i wasn't drinking   i don't like your tone   i'll redo these right away   look at you all in a snip   are you gonna watch me   what is wrong with you   honestly   why is it that every time  a man takes you out to lunch around here you're     you're the desert   that's terrible   it's constant from every corner   i'm from bay ridge   we have manners   why can't they just leave it alone   because men always bother you all the time   they follow you down the street   well  not exactly   look dear  i don't know you that well  but you're the new girl and you're not much  so you might as well enjoy it while it lasts   of course   don't be that way   i'm just offering some perspective that's all   thank you  joan   i'll save my thank you's  till you correct that correspondence   i don't know why i'm here   i'm    i mean i do  i'm     nervous i guess   anxious   i don't sleep that well   and my hands     well they're fine now   it's like when you have a problem with your car  and you go to the mechanic and it's not doing it anymore   not that you are a mechanic   i guess a lot of people must come here worried about the bum   is that true   it's a common nightmare people say   i read it in a magazine   my mother always told me  that it wasn't polite to talk about yourself   she passed away recently   i guess i already said that   can i smoke in here   we're all so lucky to be here   it's 7 30   i have to go to roys reading   i have to be there to acted surprised when jack kerouac doesn't show   lock the door when you leave   if you're gonna go home   take a shower you stink   it's cause i'm the man   you seem to forget that sometimes   i'm lucky they aren't all like you   i take that as a compliment   what do women want   well one of the things has to be  not being asked something like that   what do women want   you know better then to ask   give me a pen   jesus   what do women want   any excuse to get closer   thank god   there's that ego people pay to see   i'll have the filet of sole   excellent   cream spinach or cream corn   spinach   fried potatoes or au gratin   au gratin    with tomato juice to start   i'll have the goulash   very good  sir   vodka gimlet   old fashioned   how was your day   fine   you know i work with doctors   they'll say anything you pay them to   of course dear  but dinner in the city     i'm glad i'm hungry   i saw an interesting thing in the journal american   apparently the phone company wants to start  charging people for unlisted numbers   well  that doesn't seem fair   some people agree with you  and they're giving aliases to ma bell   they call it anom de phone   isn't that smart   of course most of them are pornographic   the best one     pat magroin   oh my god   i'd believe they would print that in the journal american  let alone in the phone book   this is nice   i'll be right up   hello   sorry to bother you so late   it's don draper   oh hello  mr  draper   no  no it's not to late at all   glad to hear that   well   well  i had a very interesting hour  with
