 mech tracks   armory could be a trap   those weapons better be worth it   it's about six hours old  that's when the rain stopped   those ones are empty   okay  who's got the ball   hal  right here   think you can get it that far  old man    5 million says you can't hit the front steps     you make that a stick of gum  we got a bet   all right  buddy  you ready  ready for this       nemo  come back   go  go  go         matty   it's time to get up   if i see him  i'll let you know  i'm sorry   what was that   word's out i saw harnessed kids before we hit the shopsmart   they want to know if i saw their kid   aw  man  oatmeal again   we passed a denny's  maybe you can get a grand slam   bite me   not much of a morning person  are you  matthew   come on  you go get in line  i'll catch up to you   i have to go report in   you gonna go look for ben tonight   that's the plan   i found some sticks in the basement   want to play catch later   after school   tom  no sign of any skitters   but wherever there's a mech     weapons inside   didn't go in   didn't feel it was worth taking it on and attracting skitters   you were to be discreet   well  we had a little breakdown in discipline   we drew fire   who   jimmy   he's a good fighter   tom   go back tonight  find out for sure   no  our agreement was that we would be going after ben  once we scouted the armory   which you haven't done   you're right   that said  just like the food stores  and the pharmacies that we've seen   it's probably empty  and the skitters are just staking it out   and you're probably right  but we need to know   hey  this isn't what we talked about   you find a better place to make camp   i scouted city hall   too many windows  buildings all around   i saw a factory on the edge of town  might work  though   i'm guessing you didn't see any harnessed kids   you know how much i want to   all right  let's go  come show me on the map   anne  captain weaver   dr  glass   couldn't help but notice  all your people are sleeping in houses  while the rest of us are in tents   my fighters need the best sleep they can get   and we need to be able to get the civilians  out of here fast in case of attack     wouldn't be feasible if everyone was in houses   well  maybe we take a few houses  and rotate some people through   what  are you their leader now   there's no leader   i'm a doctor  and doctors hear things   well  doctor  you tell your patients  that if they're dissatisfied  they're free to leave   if they want the protection of my soldiers   they can minimize the whining and be grateful for the oatmeal   they're not just eaters   they know that's what your soldiers say about them sometimes     they're eaters   they contribute to the fight   they cook  they fix clothing  they haul trash   dr  glass  a few years from now   when the skitters have been wiped out  or sent back to the undoubtedly hideous planet  that they call home   the concerns of the civilians will be addressed   until then  there's no time for this   dear lord   i did not come here to get in an argument     uncle scott wants a word with you   he has some thoughts on the aliens  he thought might be useful   happy to talk to him after i get a little food   oh  what i wouldn't give for an egg     some bacon    a hash brown   white or wheat   english muffin  fork split   with enough butter that would make  a doctor such as yourself worry about my heart   ha   you know  you never gave your opinion   on   the rights of the civilians   i don't think i've ever been to acton before   it's a nice town   civilians versus the military    it's an age old question   what side do you come down on   i think civilians are a liability and a hindrance   and i also feel  that they're the best motivation we have to fight   child  no   this way   child  2  just kick it   kick it  yeah   come on  come on  guys     here you go     scott  biology   children  biology   scott  biology  biology     it's from a greek word meaning  life discourse    that's from the dictionary  but you know what it is to me   to me  it is the study of the most miraculous gift  that has ever been bestowed on us   it is the study of the wonder and the beauty  and the mystery that is life itself   and to study it is to     well  is to learn humility  and responsibility  and gratitude  right   yeah  matt   we're not grateful for skitters   scott  no  no  we are not grateful for skitters  right   and we're not grateful for parasites or cancer  either   but they are part of life   and we're grateful for the chance to study them  right   and hopefully by studying them  we'll be able  to better figure out how to kill them  right   right   boy  yep scott  you bet   i had a class of  uh    of older kids   and i had them brainstorming about the aliens   and they came up with mostly  you know   the stuff that we all talked about     that the skitters must come from a planet  similar to ours  and      mm hmm      that they have a wide range of temperature tolerance   anyway  this one girl came up  with something that made me think   she said  you know  whenever we've dreamed up robots   we've always imagined them to sort of be  basically like ourselves     a head  two arms  two legs   but the skitters have six legs   and yet  their robots  the mechs  are bipedal   now  why wouldn't they build robots  that look like themselves  you know   well  chances are  they've been studying the earth for a while   maybe they built mechs that way  to have a bigger psychological impact on us   maybe  huh   hey  hal   those harnessed kids you saw the other day     they were headed west   yeah  but they may have changed direction after i saw them   hey  you  uh  never asked if i saw your son   i figured you'd tell me if you had   after i saw ben  you know  i just     i didn't see anything else   we'll be going out tonight  i'll be looking for him   well  when you go  i'd like to go with you   all right   hey  do you need a hand   i got it  but thanks   you could take mine   uh  oh  okay     she's kidding    i am   you are  right   o  okay   um     hey  i saw you walk in past the outpost sentries   you looked tired   what were you doing by the outpost   i was in the church on the corner  praying   it's episcopalian  not catholic  but it's close   i wonder if the skitters have a god   i  i know a lot of people have lost their faith   but mine is stronger than ever   good for you   the next time you get on your knees and pray   could you see if the big guy might get us  an operational b 2 bomber loaded with nukes   i don't pray for god to give me things   i don't think that's how it works   then what do you pray for   i ask god to show me what i could do for him   wonder who she was     girl who lived here   well  maybe she's still alive   she liked  harry potter    dad used to read these to me   i'd always fall asleep    he read them all to ben   lucky ben   maybe lourdes could read them to you   oh  for    she's just being nice   she's just trying to get in your shorts     karen    oh  don't play dumb   i'm sure you had plenty of experience  with the female admirers back at school   i played lacrosse   football players got the groupies   hey  you know there's no competition  right   hal  change of plans   whoa    uh  get a room   we got a room  could you knock   just wanted to let you know  we're going back to the armory tonight   we're going to look for ben   weaver wants us to make sure  that there's no weapons there   there aren't any  they're using it as bait   we're gonna go make sure   we'll get ben tomorrow night   well  i'll go with you when you do     anthony  me too    dal  count me in    thin walls   i guess everybody hears everything   we'll find him   yeah   all right   jimmy  come here a second   you're gonna sit this one out  all right   because i screwed up   tom needs someone bigger in case they find weapons     that'll be me    okay   good

 we can get you more guns   where   i thought you were all just a bunch of strangers  thrown together by fate   we're with the resistance  we're part of the 2nd massachusetts   the what    the 2nd massachusetts   well  how revolutionary war   so  what do you got   fife and drums  tri cornered hats   no  we have guns   hey   what you have  punk   is a 50 cal mounted to the back of a gto   you got 111 fighters and 200 civilians  camped out in the big meadow   i've been watching you     for two days   that's why we were staking out the armory   figured you'd be looking for guns   i'm not gonna kill your old man   ugh   now  he is your old man  right   i can't imagine you shouting out like that if he wasn't kin     you know what     we're not gonna kill anybody   not yet    you're all way too valuable   so  here's what we're gonna do   we're gonna make a deal   you lot for the 50 cal on the back of that car   maggie   darling  please escort young prince charming here  back into town  so that he can bring the terms of our deal  to the supreme allied commander  of the 2nd massachusetts   so  what were you     you know    before   i taught history    b  u   history  what kind of    kind of history   the sumerians on up  what   american   american   so  how's the resistance going   just getting started   you honestly believe that   i do   pope  history buff such as yourself ought to know better   i taught the american revolution   you know how that turned out   yeah   but is that the right  uh     what do you call it    analogy   instead of us being the colonials  and the aliens being the redcoats   isn't it more like we're the indians  and they're the never ending tide of humanity  coming in from europe   how'd that work out for the indians   well  if you don't see any hope     why don't i just eat a gun   well    i'll tell you  professor   and this may come off as a little insensitive   considering the 90  of mankind that's already gone to the grave   but the arrival of these evil creatures  is the best damn thing that's ever happened to me   see  we've been on a bug hunt the last six months   and we've been having a blast     maggie  is that your name    no   huh   i could have sworn  i heard him say that your name was maggie   you heard wrong   i want you to consider something   and i want you to shut up   you should join us  we're fighting back   shut up    now   are you stupid   i figured it was worth a shot   you do anything like that again   and i will use the gun    get up     turn around   bag   walk   what do you call them    spidery bastards     skitters    that's good   we call them cooties  you know   like the  uh    kids' game   well  before the cooties came   i was always going up against cops  and  you know  people like me   but you go around killing people today  even the bad guys   and people tend to get a bit uptight   but cooties    it's open season on them   you killed any   a few   how   rifle   shoot for the head   it seems to do the trick   well  i hate to be the one to tell you  friend   but you've been going about it all wrong     you don't shoot for the head   you take out a couple of legs   you slow them down  it weakens them   then you take the head shot   you ever go one on one   this one i did solo   thought i was gonna die  but i didn't    it did   you ever take down a ship   the cooties and their robot friends  respond to sound  right   the ships    they go off heat  you know that   mm hmm   well  we raided the armory  right   we got ourselves a genuine bazooka  right   and we're like   all right    so we    we peel this engine block  out of an old volkswagen  right  and we set it on fire   it gets hot enough  magnesium just  you know   ignites  like staring into the heart of the sun   having a few beers  lo and behold     in comes this airship  right   billy takes a bazooka   gets a cootie bird in its sights   lets a shell fly   it arcs   i mean  it's going    i don't know   the ship must have sensed something  right   it must have sensed it   'cause it    it just deked out of the way   that would've been sweet     hey  you think i could have a beer   why the hell not   don't go anywhere     you've got one hour   anne  do you know them   no   wonder what happened to them   as far as i heard  people from this area  were herded to the camp in stockton   then nuked   after the kids were taken   what can i do for you  doc   i had some more thoughts on the housing   mm  you're still on that   actually  yes  'cause it's still not fair   you back already   we have a problem   where's your father   don't do anything stupid   come on  i just want a beer     it's cold   yeah  ain't we civilized   got ourselves and old  uh  fridge there  running off our genny   yeah   so  he

that's no way to live   you have kids   boy and a girl   they  uh    they're with their mother in florida   i suppose i should use the past tense now   so  when you gonna do it  when you gonna make your move   excuse me   you've been  uh  eyeballing billy's sidearm  since you got here   that obvious  huh   i tend to notice little things like that   you know    here  i'm thinking  we're having this good conversation   yet you had ulterior motives   what would you do     so  you don't have  a lot of good conversation with your men  huh   you kidding   last book any of them read had a dog named spot in it   maybe you should join us     join who    the resistance    you kidding   and why would i do that   i can guarantee good conversation   and what do you get   apparently  you know how to kill skitters   you know what  professor   you kill me   i don't know what kind of fairy tales you've got  going on in that head of yours about saving the earth   but the way i see it     there ain't no place this is going but down   hal  one's bleeding out  click shot him in the leg   you mean before he died   is that supposed to make me feel better   mike  get in here   do you need me to

50  they give us tom and his team   how do we make the trade   we don't   what   you don't understand what's happening  do you   we start negotiating with them  they will bleed us dry   if they don't
