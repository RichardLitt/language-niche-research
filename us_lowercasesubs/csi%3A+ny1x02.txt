scuff marks on the knees   nails are intact   it appears putrefaction has set in   she's starting to bloat up a bit   which could explain the inconsistency of her belt   see the wear   it's two notches off   if the killer re dressed her  he did it at considerable amount of time after death   why would he dress her back up   i don't know   what i do know is    he took the time   someone out there is missing a wife   team csi  ny  zed22   space67   kanoril   mista zon   xe0linh   moustou   bendef  transcript  raceman  season 1   episode 1 blink  morning  dear   do i have a tail back there

morning   dr  hawkes   oh   sorry   your jane doe did me in   when you see her  you'll know why   okay    from the top  shall we   contusions and ecchymoses around areas of the neck   strangulation   nothing in her eyes to indicate petechial hemorrhaging   before we get to cause of death  you better see this   horizontal lividity slots along the coronal plane   she was on her back for awhile   agreat while   indicated by bedsores   cause of death   hemorrhagic stroke   she had two strokes actually   upon examination of the brain  i found evidence of an ischemic stroke  a process where blood was cut off from the cerebrum   the effects of the ischemic stroke caused severe deterioration of blood vessels in her brain   which then led to a hemorrhagic conversion   two strokes   what went on with this woman   i'm afraid it doesn't stop there   histology indicates she inhaled something her body didn't agree with   perimortem smoke inhalation   she inhaled something just prior to death   run a full tox screen   i want to know everything about this woman   leann goodman   i don't understand   there must be some mistake  this can't be my wife   mr  goodman  would you feel more comfortable if we arranged a private viewing   are you gonna okay with this   i realize this is a very trying time for you   could you tell us more about the last time you were with your wife   we had lunch that day   i put her in a cab and we parted ways   i'll see you tonight   i love you  bye     that was the last time i saw her   tox screen came back on leann goodman   sex assault   negative  but dr  hawkes was dead on   the wife inhaled something she shouldn't have    fry  sticks   laced cigarettes  what's the additive   spec found codeine based cough syrup in her blood and trace levels of nicotine   how fast the city changes  ghb is dead as disco   and fry sticks are the new date rape drug of new york city   three puffs  down goes frazier   doesn't make any sense   rape kit came back negative   why give someone a date rape drug and not rape   detective taylor   similar neck contusions as the first woman   murdered by the same hands   one way to find out   we got a serial   there's reason to believe we have a serial dumping bodies all over the city   trucks come in  they dump  and they head back out   so it's our job to sift and isolate garbage from evidence   what's the dimensions on the barge   about 140 by 38 feet   half the size of a football field   my kit's fully stocked   bring it   stella and i'll beat the m e 's   you guys aren't sticking around   we're bucking time here  danny   sooner we draw parallels to our victims  the fewer bodies we're gonna find  so focus   d j  vu in some ways   different in some others   differences first   no bed sores   cause of death   asphyxiation due to strangulation   after death is where it got nasty   he broke her neck   postmortem   he's getting more aggressive     similarities    plenty   time of death on both women was around the same time  both were putrefied   rape kit was negative  lividity slats  and  of course  neck contusions     centering around the occipital artery  internal  common and external carotid arteries   as well as the vagus nerve   all arteries to the brain   what was he doing   depriving her of oxygen   that    or blood flow to the brain   i was about to x ray her teeth  until i saw this   russian   it's gold mixed with heavy copper impurities  i saw this type of dentistry when i was in the marines   during cold weather training in scandinavia  there were a lot of russian ex pats with this type of work done   russian descent  certainly narrows my choices   do me a favor  hawkes  will you   write those arteries down for me   dr  giles   you know what they say about men who study too much data   they become a statistic   something like that   listen  do you still have that medical bust   skinless or boneless   skinless   jackpot  danny  i found a purse   unzipped  there's nothing inside   check this out   camera   still on   the back hatch is broken   maybe somebody tried to rip the film out   okay  so whoever ripped    tried to rip the film out didn't destroy every frame   black and white film   do you see red   no   wait  something's coming   where's the autopsy pic of the russian girl   that's her   they really get around  these two  huh   empire state building  rockefeller center  the zoo  the met     and     yeah  where was this taken   mr  and mrs  ivanov  we're very sorry about your loss   was zoya pavlova your daughter   we were her sponsors   she came over to america by way of moscow to be a student   it says in her missing persons report that you waited four days before reporting her missing   zoya has done this kind of thing before   the second she comes to america  she goes crazy   she's always with that american boyfriend   disappears three  four days at a time   she doesn't tell us what she does  where she goes   bogdhan  think of the girl   is this her boyfriend in the picture   yes   we found these pictures in a camera where zoya was discovered   the first four are of her and her boyfriend in front of various tourist spots   what's puzzling us is this photograph here   is this the boyfriend's residence   we have never seen his house   do you know his name   we only know him as jason   he sells stuff on the streets   street vendor  where   hey   you got a peddler's license   yeah   yeah  what's your name   jason parnell  why   hey  how you doin'   you want glasses and whatnot  there's one on every corner   cart's closed   jason parnell   i'm detective taylor   this is detective bonasera from crime scene   do you recognize this woman   yeah  that's my girlfriend   that's zoya     why  did you guys find her    she's dead   when was the last time you saw her   hey  when was the last time you saw her   i don't know  four  five days ago   we went sightseeing   we were supposed to hook up at coney island  the boardwalk that night  but she never showed up  she never returned my phone calls  so     i just figured she wanted out   i didn't know her that long   but she's    she's dead   damn   how   recognize these pictures  jason   yeah  yeah  that's us   this is the empire state building  that's the museum  this is    that's the bronx zoo   that was a funny day   the baboons pick their asses right in front of you   how about this picture  jason   you recognize this residence   no   no   then who's she blowing the kiss to   i don't know   it wasn't me   i never saw that house in my life  i swear on my grandmother   let me arrest him for swearing on his grandmother   you're coming with us   well  what about my stuff   forget about your stuff  you're good to go  let's go   trying to find a single house in a city of eight million   this should be fun   all we need is a photograph   all right  let's get this triangulation started   we'll use zoya as our primary reference  what's her height   uh  m e  says she's five nine   okay   secondary object far left   isolate the needle on the chrysler building    tertiary object  far right   the slant on the citicorp building    we've got our three reference points   how far are the buildings from zoya   we'll know in a sec   right down to her front door   circling and isolating   queens   long island city   listen  you hear that   yeah   where's it coming from   hello   she's alive   listen up   we have two dead women and one still alive  we divide and conquer   detective flack  you find the owner of this residence   put out a  wanted  message   all five boroughs  consider it done   danny  process the bedrooms  aiden  join him   okay   stella  process the basement  will you  medical equipment     where are you going   angel of mercy hospital   the victim's priority  she's alive   she may be the only person who's seen the suspect  i have to process her   mac   you all right   yes  why   you've been working yourself to the ground  when was the last time you slept   i'll rest my head when i tire   what   what is it  did the husband get to you   i'll be at angel of mercy   no pictures  no personal effects   not a partial  nothing   what's this guy live in gloves   i'm getting all kinds of love over here   i think he got tipped off   i think he got off   i thought sex wasn't part of the deal with these women   it's not   i'll have giles type it and run it through codis   maybe he can tell who's beneath the sheets   she is alive  barely   she's in a deep coma   what's her condition   critical but stable   how deep of a coma   we're still evaluating her   she's not responding to painful stimuli   we're running a cat scan to look for a cause   you have no objection if i process her   i'm detective mac taylor   i'm a crime scene investigator   i'm here to help you   first  i'd like to photograph any signs of trauma you may have suffered   scrape under your fingernails   take your fingerprints   see if we can't find out who you are   nurse  could you assist me  please   i need to photograph her neck   uh  could you  uh   turn her head please   ma'am  i    apologize  if i've done anything to make you feel uncomfortable   a half dead woman was found in your rental home   how is it you can't tell me who you rented it to   i told you  the management company handles all that   i heard that part already     too much in one interrogation  as it turns out   what this mother's face isn't buying is     how hidta  the entire nypd     me    can't seem to find a single transaction that you rented the house to a real person   hey  mind if i swab him  flack   be my guest   you won't have any problem getting his mouth open  he don't shut up   i'd like to take a buccal swab for a dna sample  it'll only take a second   open up   sir  open up your mouth  please  sir   open up  mr  silo you like things with soft tips in your mouth am i right   hey  that's harassment   thank you   hoops on saturday  flack  don't forget   where were we   dr  giles  what do you think   it didn't feel random   the blinking  no  no  it didn't   almost felt as if she was trying to communicate  but she couldn't  it's probable   what do you mean   locked in syndrome  i think i know what this is   think your angel of mercy victim may be the victim of a perverted science experiment   no doubt by someone with an acute medical acumen   locked in syndrome   a rare neurological disorder characterized by complete paralysis  of all voluntary muscles in the body with the exception of the eyes   in essence  she's  locked inside  her own body  yet her mind is fully sound   ca can she unlock   snap out of it   afraid not  the condition is irreversible   how is he intentionally  locking  them in   skillfully  i'd imagine first  he'd have to sedate the subject   put them in a docile state in order to locate specific arterial pressure points   he wasn't getting more violent  he was perfecting his maneuver   leann goodman was found     first  but she had bedsores   the russian woman we found second  died first   she had no bed sores  she died quickly   this means we found the bodies out of order   our first two victims were failures   our angel of mercy victim was a success  she was kept   so     now what  dr  giles   she's seen the killer    and she can't talk   it's mac taylor   we ran your prints through our missing persons database   but we haven't been able to i d  you as yet   ma'am     i know you can hear me   i want to find the person who did this to you   i'm going to ask you some questions  i realize you cannot speak  but     i want you to answer by blinking your eyes   i'd like you to blink twice for  yes  and once for  no   do you understand   were you answering yes   i'm going to show you some pictures   the first is a woman named     leann goodman   do you know her   this is her husband  tim goodman   did he do this to you   zoya pavlova   she's a russian woman out of coney island  do you know her   okay  this is her boyfriend  jason parnell  did he do this to you   the home we found you in belongs to this man   nurse   i need a doctor in he  nurse   detective taylor  she suffered a severe stroke  we've run some preliminary tests   i'm afraid she has a glasgow coma score of three   what are you saying  she's brain dead   i'm afraid so   hey     its me        it's detective taylor   can you hear me   it's mac taylor   can you hear me   mac   i'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news  but the dna on the semen from the bed sheets came back   no match on the boyfriend or the home owner   that only proves they didn't have sex with her   it doesn't exonerate them of murder   danny and aiden lit that place up like a christmas tree   they couldn't find so much as a partial   i talked to the victim  she implicated the home owner   you talked to the victim   i thought maybe she was blinking because     it's a temporary setback  we keep working  right   why   what  why  stella  why does he do it   what's the connection  why does he lock women inside their own bodies   talk out the nature of the crime with me   what is it  in its very nature   it's diabolical   it's calculated   it's personal   it's intimate   he removed himself from the house   if that's true  we interrupted his cover up  left us a live witness   he's saving her for some reason   he removed himself from the house   but the question is  did he remove himself from her   what about the medical equipment   we superglued and dusted  there's no detectable print   oh  th this killer's in cover up mode  he's way too smart for superglue or or powders  we need     we need further enhancement  let's spray it with rodamine  hit it with a laser     go back in    yeah    what kind of letters are those    cyrillic   they look like initials   they are   b  i    russian   bogdhan ivanov   bogdhan ivanov   says here you were a medical doctor in the soviet union   did a stint in prison under brezhnev for treason in '81   released and later fled to america   we got a match from your reference sample  to the dna mixture pulled from the bed sheets in your rental house   it also contained zoya's dna   yes  zoya and i made love in that bed many times   you loved her   very much   did you take this picture  sir   no  i wouldn't have taken you for a man in denial  mr  ivanov   doctor ivanov   you're not a doctor  you're a murderer  with a medical degree   why don't i start the story for you     doctor  you killed zoya trying to lock her inside her own body   you're a taxi driver   is that how you picked up your victims   why   why lock them in   you know what name  bogdhan  means in russia   gift from god   zoya came to me   she was the one who wanted to be taken care of by me   feed her  bathe her  read her literature   play music   she wanted to be free from the burden of daily life   achieve a cerebral utopia   live inside dreams with her mind wandering without disturbances   give her the gift of freedom   that was the plan   that was the pact   i think when zoya asked you to take care of her   paralyzing her from the eyes down wasn't what she had in mind   was it  doctor   this wasn't about freedom   or zoya   or some gift from god   this was about control   the second we darkened your door  you lost control   and you removed yourself from your house  but you left the woman   after all  she was still alive   you couldn't pull the plug  could you  doctor   it finally worked   those women died for the same reason you got caught   you didn't know when to let go   i'm so tired   you know i used to sit like this with my wife   her name was claire   she died  uh  on 9 11   nobody saw it coming   i was cleaning out that closet the other day and  uh     i found this beach ball   and i remembered     it was my wife who blew it up  i never told anybody this  but  uh   i got rid of everything that reminded me of claire   too painful   the one thing i     i couldn't throw away was     that beach ball   her breath is still in there   ground zero  please
