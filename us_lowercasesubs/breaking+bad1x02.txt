previously on breaking bad     i don't know what's been going on with you lately   you understood what i've just said to you   lung cancer  inoperable   you wanna cook crystal meth  you and me   you know the business  and i know the chemistry   you got crystals in here     what now    run  mr  white  run   i'll teach you my recipe  what do you say  you wanna cook like me    twelve hours earlier    you are a life saver    yeah  man     we can't thank you enough    hey  mad props   i could have sworn the guy said south   but then  all of a sudden we're off the main road   i'm trying to read the map while i'm driving  which is a bonehead maneuver   and all of a sudden    bam  we're in that ditch   yeah  bam  i'm like  what the hell  you know   yes  and my coffee mug   coffee  my mug of coffee   it spills all over my pants  i mean  just    a nightmare   dude  you so need gps  i mean  for real   like i said   we couldn't be more grateful   can't we just dump 'em here   what  then somebody finds them   then what  people have seen us   you're gonna flood it  man   i'm not gonna flood it  she's not gonna flood  all right   we're just gonna stay positive  right   we're going to clean up this mess  wish you would start   damn it  see  you flooded it   all right  all right  you know what   the rv is going to start now   the rv is going to start right now   it's gonna start and we're gonna drive it over to your house     my house    yes   we'll drive it over there and park it overnight     and then tomorrow      no  man  not my house   shut up   after we finish cleaning up this mess   we will go our separate ways   our paths will never cross   and we will tell this to no one   understood   what  i can talk now   fine   that goes double for me   be good to me   oh  shit   synchro   tyno transcript   tyno  kevin   walt   you coming out   yeah  absolutely   you wanna hear something funny   we had a faculty meeting last thursday  and the topic was senior class photos   and how we had instituted a new rule last year  that seniors are allowed to  have photos taken by a photographer of their choice   not necessarily the photographer that the school hires  right  so     anyway  some of the senior girls  were going to that     glamour shots place  to have their photos taken   and now they're bringing us all these photos   and joan epperman  you know joan   suddenly has to go through all these photos  and turn them down  because they show cleavage   did you get enough pancakes  sweetie   yeah  i'm good   you know  even these small busted girls    have cleavage   apparently there's some new type of brassiere   or something   the wonderbra     it's the wonderbra   hey  there  you've reached walt  skyler and walter  junior   we can't come to the phone right now  so please leave us a message   hello  mr  white  this is at t calling   are you happy with your current long distance service   'cause if you're not  i would definitely  really  love to talk to you as soon as possible about     hello  hello  this is walter white speaking   you said he was practically dead  okay   you said he would die any minute   listen  i am having breakfast with my family right now   and i really don't appreciate these sales calls   well  too bad  man  'cause guess what   he's still not dead   i went and put my ear to the rv  i can hear him  like   rolling around in there  all right   i think he's awake  man  i think he's trying to get loose   where the hell are you  i'm freaking out over here     calm down  damn it    are you gonna help me clean this up     we got loose ends here    calm down   i will be there after school   after school  are you shitting me   ditch it  man  call in sick   listen  that is just not going to work for me   i'm not interested in that at all   and i would appreciate if you don't call here anymore   damn  they're so annoying  those people     you have a good day  sweetie    okay  mom  you too   bye  honey     drive safe    okay   yo  yo  yo  148 3369   representing the abq   what up  biatch   leave it at the tone   so  the term  chiral   derives from the greek word  hand    the concept here being that  just as your left hand   and your right hand are mirror images of one another  right   identical  and yet opposite   well  so too organic compounds can exist as  mirror image forms  of one another all the way down at the molecular level   but although they may look the same   they don't always behave the same   for instance     i'm sorry    for instance     thalidomide   the right handed isomer of the drug thalidomide  is a perfectly fine good medicine to give to a pregnant woman  to prevent morning sickness but   make the mistake of giving that same pregnant woman  the left handed isomer of the drug thalidomide   and her child will be born with  horrible birth defects   which is precisely what happened in the 1950s   so  chiral  chirality   mirrored images  right   active  inactive   good  bad   yes  ben   is this gonna be on the murder   what   is this gonna be on the mid term   the chirality on the mid term  no  no  well  maybe   maybe  yes  you know  but prepare  for it to be on the mid term   can't hurt to know it  right   knowledge is power   oh  no  no     not good  not good   what the     hey  you   listen    no  no  no  no   oh  god   milf's   what the hell is a milf   now what   the other one  out in the rv  he's       you're sure    yes   positive     feel free to go check it yourself    yes  good idea   maybe i should do that before he  too  wanders off on the damn street     okay  you know what  i      all right  all right   the one downstairs  tell me about him   come on  anything  something     start with his name  at least    krazy 8   krazy 8  what the hell does that even mean   i don't know  man  okay  i mean  he's like   krazy 8  okay  i don't know   so  you work with him regularly   no  not him so much     his cousin  mainly    who's his cousin     the guy out in the rv    all right  all right   krazy 8's one level higher   one level higher   yeah  you know  not like street level   higher   you know  there's like a starbucks at every corner   krazy 8 is  like  the dude that sells starbucks his beans   okay  so he's a distributor   okay  so  is he     i mean  is he    in other words     what is his reputation for violence   well  um     he did try to kill us both yesterday  so there's that   what i'm trying to say is that he's a distributor  right   he's a    he's a businessman  he's a man of business   it would therefore seem to follow that he is capable of acting  out of mutual self interest  yes   what   do you think he is capable  of listening to reason   what kind of reason   like  dear krazy 8  listen    if i let you go  will you promise not to come back and waste my family    no colombian neckties   you mean that kind of reason   no  man  i can't say as i have high hopes where that's concerned   what was that   what was what   come see   we gotta tie him up   why the hell didn't we tie him up   because he was out cold   but what if he's faking it   like if it was me  i'd be all faking being knocked out  yo   and then  when the coast is clear   i'd be up looking for weapons and shit   waiting to pounce   now if it was me  and i couldn't find a decent enough weapon   i would just lie back down  and bide my time   so now what do we do   you keep asking me that  like you think i have some answer     well  you gotta do something    we   we have got to do something  and i am opened to suggestions   man  uh uh  okay  this whole thing was your deal   don't you dare put that on me   you brought those guys out there  this is your responsability   like i came to you  begging to cook meth    nerdiest old dude i know  you wanna come cook crystal   please    i'd ask my diaper wearing granny  but her wheelchair wouldn't fit in the rv    what about the    the phosphate gas   phosphine gas  what about it   i mean  do you think it still might kill him   you know  with like a delayed reaction or something   i don't know     you're supposed to be a scientist    look   this isn't even the issue that demands immediate attention   we have got a body in that rv   and it's getting warmer outside  understand   and we have got to do something about that soon   and in a way that no one will ever find it   now that last part  is very  very important   therefore   it seems to me that our best course of action  would be chemical disincorporation   dissolving in strong acid   oh man  that's messed up   you're not    you're not serious   you're serious   who's gonna do that   and don't look at me   i guess we'll both do it together   no  mr  white  okay  i'm not good with dead bodies   we're in this 50 50  okay   i guess the only other fair way  to go about this would be     that one of us deals with the     body situation  while the other one of us     deals with the krazy 8 situation   in a scenario like this   i don't suppose it is bad form to just     flip a coin     heads or tails    i'll do the body in the acid  okay   heads or tails   heads   best two out of three   yo  yo  yo  148 3369   representing the abq   what up  biatch   leave it at the tone   mr  white  it's me  pick up   i got a container question   hello  mr  white  pick up the phone  man   yes   what kind of plastic  man   polyethylene   how the hell am i supposed to know that   because i told you   look  just     look at the bottom for a triangle  stamped  ldpe    it should be molded right into the plastic   yeah  yeah  ldpe  right on  got it   but    i don't know  man  this feels kind of flimsy   any decent acid's gonna eat right through this     not hydrofluoric    why not   look  you skipped   clowned around or otherwise jerked off  to every lecture i ever gave   as far as i'm concerned  your chemistry education is over   oh  okay  be a dick about it   so  hey  have you     have you done the thing   yeah  i'm working up to it   you know what  i bet he doesn't even wake up   not even if you took him to the hospital right now   now  if it was me  i would just try and think of it like i was     i was doing him a favor   who's there   don't you fucking play games with me  who's there   yeah  i see you   what are you gonna do   i need water   bring me some water  would you   please   you don't like the crust   where's my cousin emilio   he dead   hey  mr  white   mr  white   are you smoking weed   oh  my god   wait a minute  is that my weed   what the hell  man   make yourself at home  why don't you   so what did you end up buying   nothing   no store in town sells a plastic bin big enough for a body   i don't suppose you could buy two bins     legs in one  torso in the other   god   i don't suppose you could kiss my ass   how did it go   so you didn't do it   not yet   god     i gotta go    what  no  come back here   sorry  i'll do it tomorrow  i promise   tomorrow   i've got a doctor's appointement  i gotta go   look  stay away from him   he's awake   hey  man  we flipped a coin   we flipped a coin   we're good   we're very good   we're excellent  i'd say   oh  would you look at that face   smile  peanut   so  who's up for knowing   girl   girl     you sure    pretty sure   can i tell you this is exactly what i was hoping   you remember you said that when she's 16 and starts dating   looking fabulous

our house again   you stay away from him  or you'll be one sorry individual   you got me   i think so  yeah   no more marijuana   i can dig it   you can dig it   wonderful   not that it's any of my business   but you might wanna consider a different line of work   okay    let's go to your house  yo    makes perfect sense  let's      let's completely screw up your house   so you never wanna spend another night in it     sure  you know  why not     and then  how's about i send over my psycho bitch wife to      you know  break your balls and threaten you    god  that'd be hilarious     and then  the killer in the basement    the one who's completely my responsabilty    hell  let's just let him live down there    just  i don't know  make sure to feed him  like      three times a day     sure  why not    that would be amazing    thank you so much for the opportunity    i always dreamt about  i don't know  melting bodies    you got a brother in the goddamned dea   what   you said you were just doing some ride along   yes or no  do you have a brother in the dea   brother in law   now there's a load off my mind   where did you hear that   your freaking wife told me when she was here all up on my shit   yeah  that's right   she almost caught me moving emilio   good job in wearing the pants in the family   and why did you go and tell her i was selling you weed   because somehow  it seemed preferable to admitting  that i cook crystal meth and killed a man   is that what i think it is   yeah  it is  i smoked a bowl  so what   my house  my rules   hey  no  no  don't give me that  okay  i held up my end   i already took care of emilio   you're still diddling around  trying to get your nut up   well  boo hoo  i have the truly awful job here   you wanna talk awful  you wanna go there   try dragging 200 pounds of stink up a flight of stairs   i barely got him in the bathtub   bathtub  what       what do you mean   bathtub     that's another thing   why you got me running around town   trying to find some stupid piece of plastic   when i have a perfectly good tub i can use   oh  god   i'm sorry  what were you asking me   oh  yes   that stupid plastic container i asked you to buy   you see  hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic   it will however dissolve metal  rock   glass  ceramic   so there's that
