is she ever gonna get a clue  what a loser   come here   hey  isn't that your dad's car   aria   emily   when did you get back   hey   yesterday   i almost didn't recognize you   i think the last time we saw each other   you had a pink stripe in your hair   well  when your parents want you to be yourself  and you don't know who you are     you wore it well   you should have called   it's so weird just running into you here   oh   well  we've kind of lost touch  emily  remember   that's what we had to do   i saw a poster of alison yesterday   it's awful   i mean  we all know she's dead  right   i just never heard anyone say it   so  i hear the new teacher's really hot   is that hanna   she's the  it  girl now   and where there's hanna  there's mona   that's mona   can you believe it   wow  talk about a makeover   what's up with her   you two fighting   we didn't just fall out of touch with you  aria   we all fell out of touch with each other   they're not so close anymore either   so they're friendly  but not friends   holy crap   sorry   uh  i'm mr  fitz  your new english teacher   alison   i can't believe they sold the house   just too many memories for the dilaurentises   i can't even imagine   it's just so weird to think of other people living in alison's house   i know  honey   aria's back   does she still have that pink hair   no  mom  she doesn't   you know something  i never really understood that family   why would a mother let her daughter do something like that   because they believe their kids are their equals  not their property   honey  i don't think you're my property  but i'm your mom   what kind of mother would i be if i let you  run around looking like a goth   that kind of lifestyle might fly in europe   but it's not gonna get you very far here in rosewood   not everyone dreams of making it in rosewood  mom   oh   some people dream of making it out   you want that   maya st  germain  a k a  new girl   i'm emily   welcome to the neighborhood   thank you   mmm  foie gras and cornichons   my favorites   it's from my mother   i figured   oh  that stuff was in my room   you can have anything you want   it all belonged to alison   is she a friend of yours   she was  a long time ago   that's all i get  no details   uh  there were five of us who used to hang out  but     we don't anymore   would it be outrageous of me to ask  if you'll help with our last few boxes   yes   but i don't mind   female vocalist    so  why aren't you still friends  with the girl who used to live here   you ask a lot of questions   how else am i supposed to get to know you   there you go  another question   fine  your turn   ask me anything   is this your boyfriend   his name is justin   he's cute   he's also 3 000 miles away   my boyfriend's name is ben   what's he like  he's a swimmer  like me   i bet you're good   you totally have the body   my mom's a cellist   they're building a studio   do you play  yeah   but not the cello   if you're a big jock   does that mean you'd kill me if i smoked a little weed   now   i won't if you don't want me to   where are your parents   relax   they're out   go ahead   you want to join me   okay   first time   no   yes   so i'm corrupting you   you okay with that   yeah  i think i am   hey  what do you think   you have an eye for design  i absolutely love it   thank you   honestly  when mom said you were converting the barn to a loft   i couldn't see it  but it's beautiful   job well done   i'm glad you like it   and i totally appreciate your letting us move in   what   ren and i are staying in the barn while we redo my place in the city   i'm moving in for junior year  melissa   that's the deal that i made with mom and dad   i got the grades  i did the internship   i gave up my summer because i wanted this   well  you'll just have to wait   why can't you stay in my room   we're a couple  spencer   we need our own space  and mom and dad agree   but they promised me   is everything okay   i'm ren   i was hoping you'd be happy for me   well  you know what they say about hope   breeds eternal misery   sounds like she was counting on moving into the barn   don't worry about spencer  she'll get over it   shouldn't you know better   i mean  you are a med student  right   you're a bit of a smart ass   a bit   does my sister know you smoke   does she have to know everything   i'm sorry that we're moving into your loft   if you want me to say something   it wouldn't make a difference   thank you for being sorry   you're not like melissa's usual boyfriends   how am i unusual   we're late for dinner   i actually like you   that's what's unusual   you told me you went to hollis   no  i said i was thinking about majoring in english   and that's true   look  i think you're amazing  aria   when i first met you  i thought      who is this girl    i'm still that girl  nothing's changed   yes  yes  it has  i'm your teacher   i know it's not just me   you   you feel like this is right for us too   it's not right   we just can't   thanks for walking me home   it's no big deal   practice doesn't start until four   i've never had a jock friend before   i guess that makes you my first   are you okay   it's hard for me to talk about   i didn't tell you everything about the girl who used to live here   alison   she disappeared last summer   she's still missing   that must have been awful for you   i used to think if i didn't talk about her  i wouldn't think about her   but yostill do  yeah   i'm sorry   see you tomorrow   yeah  bye   hey  you been hanging out with aria   not really   emily   is everything all right   why wouldn't it be   perfect time for a jacuzzi   i thought you guys weren't moving in till next week   melissa wanted to get settled before classes start   you wouldn't happen to have a towel  would you   tough day at school   tough field hockey practice   i rowed for oxford   that looks good on a med school app   i did it 'cause i loved it   mm   you probably have a fluid buildup in your bursa sac   i bet you say that to all the girls   i can help   okay     dr  ren   that's awesome   is that all right   melissa  ren   who were you talking to   no one   found them   look what else i found   ohh  she used to drag that thing everywhere   i think you're happy to be back   aren't you   well  haven't decided yet   ohh  you and aria are so much alike   i don't think she's happy to be home either   i know it was like a vacation from our real life  but     i felt like we really bonded when we were away   well  we had to connect  we didn't know anybody else   i don't want to lose that   are you really worried that we will   it's just easy for stuff to get in the way   what do you mean  what kind of stuff   ohh     you know  i'm really surprised that she brought that with us   well  she loves it because you gave it to her   what kind of stuff could get in the way of us   no  nothing  nothing  you know me   i just get a little overly obsessed about work  that's all   hm   we're good  ella   come here   mm  it's all good   oh  i drove past alison's house today   it's definitely something i haven't missed   oh  god  a year later   imagine what that poor family is going through   i can't  i don't ever want to imagine   if anything ever happened to you    nothing is gonna happen   we are safe  we're together   and we're

that   somebody left a note in my locker   from  a   you too   do you really think it's her  is it possible   only alison could have known   what  known   known what   it was     personal   i really believed she was dead   yeah  yeah  we all did   could she really be back   i think she's playing with us   why would she do that   it's alison that we're talking about here   i mean  wasn't that her favorite sport   should we tell someone   i don't     i don't know about you  but     i can't   i'm glad you're back   it's funny     i mean  even though i grew up here   i feel like a total outsider   me too   i ran into ella montgomery today   why didn't you tell me aria was back   it's not like we're still friends   she didn't know your father left   i hate telling that story   so change the story  i did   you grew up  you grew apart   it was mutual  and  honestly   we are much happier without him   hanna   say it enough  and you'll actually start to believe it   well  i have to admit  it does sound a lot better than the truth   nobody needs to know that we got dumped    we  didn't get dumped  i did   he left both of us   if that's mona  i'm staging an intervention   hanna  it's dinnertime   it's ashley   yes  i left it on your desk  mm hmm   hanna marin   yeah  why   is your mother home   let me call you back   what's this about   we received a call from rosewood mall

why i do it   then why do    this is something you do   a few times   this is about your father  isn't it   you think this is going to get his attention   i made a mistake   in rosewood  you don't have room to make a mistake   and neither do i   i'm sorry   i'll fix it somehow   you will deny you did anything wrong   it was a misunderstanding   but     i'm taking care of it   female vocalist
