quite liked   one minute   but a second ago  you said two minutes     what's going on here    time flies  huh   you   you're a character   i was telling my friends this morning how yesterday you come to me and    if you don't get out of town in  come on  what is that   they thought it was a joke  they started laughing   you tell them about the man you killed   the way you did it   'cause i found nothing funny in that   then maybe i should've killed you  huh  maybe i made a mistake   we all have regrets   cut me a little slack here  okay   does nothing count  that i let you live   i'm giving you the same consideration right now   you can get up and go    so  what are you gonna do   in front of all these people  you're gonna pull out a gun  and you're gonna shoot an unarmed man   you're unarmed  huh   you got eyes  you see a piece on me     you know what  seriously   you come in  you interrupt my meal  you won't eat with me   this is bullshit   this is supreme bullshit   us attorney's gonna have a lot of questions   nothing i can't answer   they might think that you cornered him  didn't give him a choice     he had a choice    how's the hat  hmm   i was wondering if it shrunk  got a little too tight   you took it off your head  and now you're suffering from sunstroke   you do know  we're not allowed to shoot people on sight anymore       i didn't    and haven't been for     maybe 100 years    he pulled first   it's not about who pulled first   you remember the meth head last year  the one who pulled a shotgun   that ended up on what  page nine  this    this bullshit     this is gonna be on the nightly news   episode 101  fire in the hole  doj inquiry number 359826  into the shooting death of thomas francis buckley  on march 3  2010   in miami  florida   would you like to make a statement   the marshal's office has conducted an internal investigation  of the proceedings  that occurred at the hotel in question on     come on  let's just keep it simple  huh   he pulled first  i shot him   i thought that went well   you thought that went well   i got a phone call this morning from the director   before that  the director got a phone call from the ag   let me put it to you this way  the weather forecast  is for a shitload of shit raining down on this office from washington   i'm gonna reassign you   prison transport   no  i'm getting you out of dodge   they need manpower in the eastern district of kentucky   i talked to the chief of the district  art mullen     said you guys taught firearms together at glynco   no  no  dan  i grew up in kentucky  i don't want to go back there   we have a problem  because you don't want to go back to kentucky   and you cannot  under any circumstances  stay here   got any other skills   a bit of a comedown from the miami office  i'd expect   not with you here   good to see you   i won't overwhelm you with everybody's name right now   you want to go have a drink   sounds good   follow me  and i'll pack up  and we'll go   you look the same as you did at glynco     same coat  same boots   the boots are fairly new   don't tell me that hat is   no  it's old   have a seat   you were working fugitives in miami  huh   yeah  i did   here  everybody does everything     fugitives  witness relocation   judicial protection   forfeitures   prisoner transport   boy  every office i ever worked in   prisoner transport was the shit detail     chief always used it as punishment   but here we all do it     even you    no  hell no   i heard about you and winona   from who   winona  she works here   in lexington   in the courthouse    she's a court reporter   i knew she was coming back to kentucky  i think her mom took ill   i thought that was why you picked kentucky   art  no offense     i didn't pick kentucky   i talked to your marshal down there in miami   tell me about the shooting   it was justified   you concerned about me coming down here   it's a small office  raylan   i'm concerned when we switch brands of coffee   is your dad still down there in harlan   far as i know   thought you were from there   reason i ask    the us attorney's trying to build this case  against this guy in harlan  and he's about the same age as you   it's a small town   thought you might know him    boyd crowder   my god  art  any other shit you want to dump on me tonight     you do know him    yeah  i know him   boyd and i dug coal together when we were 19   boyd   what do you think   jared  i think it sucks   what  why   i appreciate the sentiment   wanting to go after a federal building under construction   but  you see  we'd need us a whole box of emulex to bring that down   and that's if you got cuts in the steel   and all we got's a rocket launcher   and impressive as that is  the only thing it's gonna do  is knock some shit around   don't you worry about it  we'll just go to plan b   plan b   there's always a plan b   now  it used to be a couple of crackers in an suv   would set the jungle on edge   these surely are end times   all right  this is it right here   let's shoot straight up here  make a right   this is good right here   i believe we can take her from here   what  you gonna blow up that church   boyd  there's people on the streets   they're gonna see us  they're gonna id my car   you worried about your car   you know  i just crushed     fire in the hole   boyd became a powder man   he'd crawl down the hole with his case of emulex 520   come out stringing wire  call out  fire in the hole  to clear the shaft   she'd blow  and we'd go back in  dig out the pieces   we weren't what you'd call buddies  but you work a deep mine with a man   you look out for each other   after that  he joined the army   and he went to kuwait for desert storm   and when he came back   after a couple years   he quit paying his taxes   claimed that he was a sovereign citizen   and so us attorneys sent him down to alderson   that's where he got involved with the patriot movement  and the white supremacy bullshit   got them making horseshit bombs  you know   fertilizer and fuel oil   they'll come into a town like somerset  and they'll blow up a car   and then while the cops are busy  they'll go rob a bank   saw that in a steve mcqueen movie   these guys ain't movie actors   did he change much   other than the fact he's now a racist asshole   he's lost some hair   but that's about it   how come you didn't want to blow up that church   i told you   i didn't want them to id my car   i got to thinking  that maybe you had an aversion to hurting people   hell no   i also got to thinking  that a building under construction  might just be the kind of innocuous target     you know what that means  that means harmless   it might just be the kind of harmless target  that the federal bureau of imperialism might be willing to sacrifice  in order to get somebody deep in the movement   you think i'm a snitch   all i know is you don't have any tattoos   you keep rubbing that head like you don't think that hair's gonna grow back   you think i'm a snitch 'cause i rub my head   you understand where i'm coming from  right   you come out here from oklahoma    full of piss and vinegar   talking about how you were tired of spray painting synagogues   saying you want to blow some shit up   you don't believe me  you check it out     why don't you call oklahoma    we are   devil's doing it as we speak   you'll see  boyd  i ain't no snitch   like you said   we'll see   right there     turn that shit off    why don't you eat my ass     how'd it go    out of the way     get over    the primary was a waste of time   but took care of the secondary just fine     where you at    east of 75 on tates creek road   we got a call from oklahoma   jared checks out   how'd he do   i had to let jared go   was it 'cause you didn't trust him or you just didn't like him much   probably a little bit of both   i am gonna need you to pick me up  though   i will show that my client did not engage in fraud   a report by a forensic accountant will show that any anomalies  are due entirely to a misentering of amounts   a common bookkeeping error   and by no means fraud   thank you  counselor   will the prosecution please approach the jury   thank you  your honor   it might seem like a simple technical mistake   but the state will prove there was malicious intent     one second   sorry  i was in the courthouse  i'll be up in a minute   tates creek road   i think i know where that is   county sheriff's deputy found it just after dawn   name's jared hale   bureau has him listed as some kind of aryan knight   oklahoma driver's license and registration   you got him connected to boyd     so far  tenuously    i talked to his sister in tulsa   and she said that he came to kentucky to hook up with some commandos   now  that's probably the murder weapon  it's recently been fired   there's no prints on it  in fact  the whole vehicle's clean   except for this   now  do you know what that is   i didn't  either   that is the cap that goes on the end of a rocket launcher   no shit   last night in lexington  we had a church bombing   and the feeb says that whoever did it used a rocket launcher   all the wits say the same   two white males drove up in a dark suv   they parked at that corner by the curb   one male got out with what looked like a bazooka   he said a few words and then fired at the church   what did he say  the fella that got out of the suv   one said it was  liars and hos    another heard  time to go   my favorite's  heidi heidi heidi ho    maybe we should put out an apb out on cab calloway     i think he's dead    then he should be easy to find   the pastor had it different   he heard the man say   fire in the hole    you know what  why don't you just go just do your job   did the good pastor say he got a good look at the shooter     he says no    i bet if we put crowder in a lineup  and told the pastor that the trigger man was there   it might jog his memory   rachel  why don't you go ask our old friend  if he'll have a word with us     be nice    when am i ever not nice   you think fandi's gonna want to cooperate   fandi is ethiopian by way of jamaica  by way of being completely full of shit   the temple of the cool and beautiful jc  was one of those churches that claims that marijuana is a sacramental herb     it is protected by the constitution    the constitution of dope sellers   'cause selling ganja to kids means you're a drug dealer   i could've sworn i told her to be nice   pastor fandi  if i could just talk to you for just one moment     no  you could not   i saw peter tosh once   you assume 'cause i'm black and have a jamaican accent  i like reggae   people assume a lot about me  it's the way of the world   how was he  peter tosh   it was not my taste  but the girl i was chasing loved him   and i let her stay till the encore before i took her off to jail   what do you want   that was a close one   i felt the air move   what's all the fuss  they out of velveeta   your brother got shot   what  where   at his house   no  dumb ass  where on his body     i don't know    is it serious   he's dead   did you know bowman crowder  boyd's brother   sort of  star running back in high school   boyd was always saying bowman had the goods to go pro   i was never that sure   you remember the girl he married  ava   if it's the same one  she lived down the street     she's married to bowman    she was   she ended the union last night with a  30 06   plugged him right through the heart   that's the sheriff's report  she admits shooting him  says she got  tired of bowman getting drunk and beating her   she still in custody   she was arraigned  did you talk to her   i did  i told her  given boyd's reputation   he's probably gonna come looking for her   she said it's none of our business   i told her it is if he shoots her   we should go talk to her again  is that the address   yeah  but good luck on finding it  i tried to map it  got nothing   i guess some places haven't been entered into the system   like north korea and raylan's hometown   i know where it is   my god   you remember me   i never forgot you   i had a crush on you from the time i was 12 years old   i knew you liked me  but you didn't want to show it   you were too young   i was 16 when you left   i heard you got married   are you still   turned out to be a mistake   want to talk about mistakes   i told bowman i wanted a divorce   he goes   you file  you'll never be seen again    he said i'd disappear from the face of the earth   do you want a drink   i'd love one   i married him a year out of high school 'cause he was cute   he was sure of himself  and he told me he'd never work in a goddamn coal mine   he'd wear the blue and white of the university of kentucky   and then he'd get drafted by a pro team   he wouldn't mind the cowboys   what do you want in yours  i got diet coca cola  rc cola   dr pepper   just ice   i ever forget to fill the trays  bowman would start slapping me    what's wrong with you  don't you know how to keep house    and that all started as soon as he realized  he was never getting out of harlan   he blamed it on me  said it was my fault he had to dig coal   it was my fault that i had a miscarriage after he beat me with his belt  and     he didn't have a son to take hunting with him  and his creepy brother  boyd   last time he hit me was  because i called his brother creepy to his face   he kept after me  with that belt till i fell and i hit my head on the stove   i got up off that floor knowing that he was never gonna hit me again   the next night   he came in   i had his favorite supper on the table     ham and yams and cream style corn  and left over okra fixed with tomatoes   i waited till he was shoveling food in his face   then i got his deer rifle from the kitchen closet   and i went in there  and i did what i had to do   i just finished cleaning up   i had to scrub the wall with lysol   to get the stain off of it   lysol's the best cleaning product you can buy   i still got a knot  where i fell and i hit my head on the stove   you want to feel it   dear lord  my hair's a mess   you close your eyes  i don't want you to see me like this   the minute you walked in  i knew everything was gonna be all right   i was right about you   about what   having a crush on you  you're a good kisser   i was thinking we'd have to stop doing that   why   this isn't a social call  ava   came down to harlan on business   you tell me all about your business when i get out of the shower   who the hell are you  the undertaker   i might be undertaking a situation here   let me see your chest   you buy that necklace or poach the gator and yank her teeth out   i shot her and ate her tail   that would put you in florida  around lake okeechobee   belle glade  who are you   i'm a deputy    united states marshal   you mind telling me who you are   you know your name  don't you   i'm dewey crowe   i sent a boy to starke from belle glade   fella named dale crowe jr   he's my kin   what are you doing here  mr  crowe     i come to take ava someplace    hold on   let me tell you something   you don't walk into a person's house unless you're invited   what you better do is go on outside   you knock on the door   ava wants to see you  i'll let you in  she don't  and you can be on your way   all right  i'm gonna go out   and then i'm coming back in   you better hold on there a sec while i explain something to you   i want you to understand   i don't pull my sidearm unless i'm gonna shoot to kill   that's its purpose  to kill  so it's how i use it   i want you to think about that before you act and it's too late   jesus christ  i got a scattergun pointed right at you   can you rack in a load before i put a hole through you     where'd you want to take her    i don't understand you     boyd want to see her    it's not your business   you know boyd and i were buddies  we dug coal and drank beer together   in fact  you see him  you tell him i'm in harlan  all right   if i was you   i'd give up this nazi bullshit   go back to poaching gators    safer   next time i see you  i'm gonna     you tell boyd his old buddy wants to see him     only reason i don't take ava out and shoot her     'cause i see she had no choice in what she done   don't get me wrong  i loved my brother   but you knew bowman  you knew how he could get   and that woman  she showed some spunk    you think about it     doing what she did  and then there's the bible   in the bible  it says that a man should see to the needs of his brother's widow   and i intend to do that   they sure are taking their sweet time   let me ask you something   shouldn't we have our money from your boys in lexington by now   i'll give them a call  don't worry  they're good for it   you damn right they're good for it   'cause if they aren't  i'll go down there and blow their shit up  too   come on   let's go   right now   right now   come on  let's go   who was that   the one with the  heil hitler  on his neck   he was one of bowman's buddies   you haven't seen boyd   i mean  since   but he'll be after me  i know  he's been after me   that's why we want to keep an eye on you   you know i'm    i'm with the marshal's service   i believe your mother told me before she passed   you been to see your father   are you looking for boyd   we are   but we have to catch him in the act     robbing a bank  blowing up a church     making an attempt on your life   mine   you said yourself he'll be coming after you   boyd don't want to shoot me   he wants to    you know   go to bed with me   you want me to help you catch him   maybe you could just  get him to talk to me   i could do that   you know where he is   i do   and did you want to tell me   what do i get if i do   who you know drives a town car   look at you     a suit   a necktie   looking good   looking like a lawman   now  see   this is how you wear a hat  all casual   not down on your goddamn ears like you do   i heard you called on ava   my boy dewey said he had to run you off   you believe that   not if you say it ain't so     i'll take care of him    get us a jar and two glasses   this party's just for raylan and me   go on   he just got his release  so he's feeling a little itchy   i can tell   old times   you been gone too long   god damn   so  what     what was life like in florida   just as advertised    sunny and hot   i just don't think i could take me a place so flat   you seen your daddy yet   no  not yet   boy  he was a wild man back in his day  wasn't he   what was that scam he had going back in the early '90s     stealing mining machinery   selling it to the colombians  getting paid in cocaine    you remember that   guess i was gone by then   how's your daddy   i suspect you know how my daddy is   yeah  all those days  good and bad  they all long gone now   everything's changed  it's all changed  mining's changed   no more following a seam underground   cheaper to take the tops off mountains  and let the slag run down and ruin the creeks   you remember the picket lines  don't you   courts backing the company scabs and gun thugs   whose side you think the government's always been on   us or people with money   and who do you think controls that money   who do you think  wants to mongrelize the world   who   the jews   you know any jews   see     i recruit skins   they don't know no more than you do   and i have to teach them that we have a     a moral obligation to get rid of the jews  see  it was in the bible   where   in the beginning   it's part of creation   see  in the beginning   right  you had your mud people   now  they were also referred to as beasts because they had no souls   see  they were soulless   and then cain    you remember him  now   he laid down with the mud people   and out of these fornications came the edomites   do you know who they are   who     they're the jews    you're serious   read your bible as interpreted by experts   you know  boyd   i think you just use the bible to do whatever the hell you like   what do you think i like  raylan   you like to get money and blow shit up   i know about your friend devil and his record selling dope   and i'm willing to bet  that you blew up that church in lexington  not because it was black  because it was a dope store   by some other dope dealer around  who didn't like the idea of the preacher getting a free pass from the police   win win for you  wasn't it  boyd   not only did you get to blow something to smithereens  you got money   see  i'm giving you the benefit  you aren't mental   i know you're not stupid enough to believe that mud people story   you think you know me   i know you  deputy marshal raylan givens   i know you like to shoot bad people   i heard about that gun thug you shot in a hotel  in miami  you heard about that   we have tvs down here now  raylan   but  you know   at any point   when you were looking at that gun thug   did you see your daddy's face   the reason i'm here     we're having a little lineup tomorrow at the courthouse   what did i do now   listen  we got a witness  who saw a man fire a bazooka into a church   and i'd appreciate it if you'd be in that lineup     i bet you would    you either show up   or we'll come get you   let me ask you a question   would you shoot me  if you get the chance   you make me pull  i'll put you down   reverend  what do you think   i don't know  you know  it was dark  and the man was far away   and if you heard anybody  you know  shoot a rocket at you   you don't stand there and look  you know  i just run   cut them loose   i did my part  i showed up   the idea of walking in past a gathering of law enforcement appealed to you   especially since you knew that preacher didn't have the balls to pick you   it's always good to see you   you know that man you shot in florida   my boy dewey's cousin down there    he said he heard a rumor  that you gave that gun thug  or you'd shoot him on sight   is that true   i gave him the option to leave miami  he turned it down   what would you say if i made you the same offer   you get out of harlan county by tomorrow noon   or i'm gonna come looking for you   does that sound fair   now you're talking   my lawyer's talking to the prosecutor   come with me while i smoke   i plead to manslaughter  and i won't have to go to prison   though if i have to  i have to  it was worth it   why don't you come by for supper   i'll pick up a couple of fryers   fix you some hot biscuits and gravy   look at you licking your lips   all my life  fried chicken's been my favorite   but i shouldn't   why not   because     an officer of the law isn't supposed to be  socializing with the defendant in a murder investigation   i didn't know that   it's sort of frowned upon   i'm fixing it anyway   you're a big boy   you want to come  there's nothing on earth gonna stop you   if it weren't for boyd  i'd have me some of ava   wasn't for boyd  me and you could have us the marshal   so  what did boyd say exactly      he's coming for you  or  we're coming    he said he was   but we don't know whether he wants to shoot you or blow you up  do we   then again  he could just jump the gun  and come after you when you aren't looking   if i was you  i'd look under the car before i turned the key every time   we're like big game hunters   except that you're the bait   you're kind of like the goat tethered to the pole   and all i got to do is keep you in sight   you're enjoying this  aren't you   he's at the motel with his friends   well  do you see our friends   i do   what do you want us to do   sit tight   you expecting someone   give me them things   what are they doing out there   you folks are missing a hell of a show   i think rachel's trying to shoot the moon   i don't try  i do  and you weep   one single  solitary tear   hello   can you smell the chicken frying   it'll be done by the time you get here   i'm on my way   boyd's at ava's   you sure   i'm not saying there was a gun to her head   but she didn't sound right   let's hit it   call raylan  tell him to keep the line open     where do you want me    keep going  get ava  we got this   you got this   go

hello  gary   you almost gave him a heart attack   sorry about that   i told him if you were gonna shoot him   you would've done it six years ago when i left you   what are you doing here  raylan   i'm gonna be working in kentucky   working for the marshal's office   what are you doing here   i was in nicaragua a while back   looking for this     money launderer named roland pike   the cartel's gun thug  tommy bucks  was looking for him  too   bucks     got me  took my gun  put me in a car with some other man   drove us to some old coconut plantation   then he tied the man to a palm tree  and asked me where roland was   i told him what i knew    no sense in lying   i guess  he wasn't certain he could believe me  and needed to be sure   or he just wanted to impress upon me how serious he was   but i watched as tommy bucks  stuck a stick of dynamite in that poor man's mouth   taped it so he couldn't spit it out   and lit the fuse   the next time i saw tommy bucks was in miami   i told him he's got 24 hours to get out of town  or i'm gonna kill him   did you   but he pulled first  so i was justified   but what troubles me  is what if he hadn't   what if he just sat there  and let the clock run out   would i have killed him anyway   i know i wanted to   guess i just never thought of myself as an angry man   you do a good job of hiding it  and i     i suppose most folks don't see it  but  honestly   you're the angriest man i have ever known       la fabrique      downloaded from
