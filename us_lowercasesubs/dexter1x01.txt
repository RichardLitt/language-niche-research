  stop  that never helped anybody   please  you can have anything   that's good  beg  did these little boys beg   i couldn't help myself   i couldn't  i just     please  you have to understand   trust

wrapped hefties  in my own small corner of the world   it'll be a neater  happier place   a better place   my name is dexter  dexter morgan   i don't know what made me the way i am   but whatever it was left a hollow place inside   people fake a lot of human interactions   but i feel like i fake them all   and i fake them very well   ahoy   ahoy  there  captain  any big marlin out there today   and that's my burden  i guess   but i don't blame my foster parents for that   harry and doris morgan did a wonderful job raising me   but they're both dead now   i didn't kill them     honest   you're different  aren't you  dexter   what do you mean  pop   the billups say buddy disappeared   i found the grave  son   that dog was a noisy little creep  dad   he was barking all night  and mom couldn't sleep   and she's very  very sick   and that lousy dog was yapping  at every leaf that blew down the sidewalk   there were a lot of bones in there  dexter   and not just buddy's   hola  dexter   blood     sometimes it sets my teeth on edge   other times  it helps me control the chaos   the code of harry  my foster father  is satisfied   and so am i   harry was a great cop here in miami   he taught me how to think like one   taught me how to cover my tracks   i'm a very neat monster   dexter  are you there   okay  dex  please  as soon as you get in   i'm at a crime scene by the shithole the seven seas motel   and i need you here  okay   dex  please   pretty fucking please with cheese on top   that's my foul mouthed foster sister  debra   she has a big heart but won't let anyone see it   she's the only person in the world who loves me   i think that's nice   i don't have feelings about anything   but if i could have feelings at all  i'd have them for deb   there's something strange and disarming  about looking at a homicide scene in the daylight of miami   it makes the most grotesque killings look staged   like you're in a new and daring section of disney world     dahmer land   you better be a cop   no  forensics   dex   hey  what's up   jeez  deb  where the hell do you keep your gum   they found another hooker in the pool   another  chopped up in bits and pieces   that's the third one in five months   third  you mean there's a     a serial killer  that's right   the other two were in broward   chopped up just like this one   any suspects   wish i knew   i'm on vice  so laguerta sent me to my room  and told me to stay out of sight   god forbid she listens to what you have to say   tell me about it   how does someone so dumb get so much power   she knows how to play the game   you could take a lesson   in what  ass kissing   politics   i just want to catch this guy  before he kills another one of my girls   you can't get so emotionally invested   you always say that  so did dad   yeah  but he also said   go after what you want    i want out of vice and into homicide   what can i do to help   you get these hunches  you know   with these types of murders   only sometimes   well  see if you get one this time   and can i bounce some ideas off of you later   i always get smarter when i'm talking to you   you just need a little more confidence   all right  i'll take a look   in the meantime  avoid laguerta and talk to captain matthews   he and dad were tight  maybe he'll put you on the case   you're making me smarter already  see   and keep the sex suit on when you talk to the captain   it'll help your cause   that's a nice haircut  masuoka   i saw your sister  damn  looking hot   yeah  she should  it's hot as hell out here   so    why are you here   it's a crime scene   yeah  but you do blood spatter  so   so    there's no blood here   what was that   yeah  there's no blood in or on  or near the body at all   it's the weirdest thing you ever saw   hey  angel  let's show him   no blood   no sticky  hot  messy  awful blood   no blood at all   why hadn't i thought of that  no blood   what a beautiful idea   how does the killer get rid of the blood   it's hard to say   the body's in good shape   she got a nice ass  too   head is over there  if you want to take a look   this is unique   no shit   and no prints  either   i've never seen such clean  dry  neat looking dead flesh   wonderful   very clean   yeah  but he didn't finish   no termin    it looks pretty completo to me  angel   no  no  look   he cut the leg in four pieces  almost like using a ruler   but this leg is in three pieces   now  look  he started to make a fourth cut but stopped   it's possible that he got interrupted   laguerta's looking for a witness   working on the motel porter back there   god help him   no blood   i can't think  i have to get out of here   dex   d nde va   where are you going   hey  no blood    no trabajo   i wish she'd stop that   it's one of those mating rituals  which i really don't understand   but that bloodless body     this guy may have exceeded my own abilities   morning  dex   morning   hey  dex   hey  sue  dan   how are the families   good  you   see you at the next bloodbath   never miss a party   thanks   salt of the earth  these people   and they work hard   but with the solve rate for murders at about 20    miami is a great place for me   a great place for me to hone my craft   viva miami   dex   oh  i like your other outfit better   you're a sick bastard  guess what   sex suit worked  captain put me on the case   laguerta wasn't happy  but she needs to get laid   i guess  so congrats   so you got any ideas yet   nope   well  uh  start working on your mental autopsy  'cause i could use your theories   and thanks for the fucking doughnut   i got to go   doughnut   you keeping your fingernails clean   never leave home without my rubber gloves   good boy   so  anything new   one of these days you're gonna tell me   i already told you   blood spatter doesn't take up all my time   i like doing it  maybe i can help out   it fills my nights   you have a morbid sense of fun   that's probably true   you should find a pretty girl   i found you   charming like your father   just don't get me fired   then who would i bring doughnuts to   angel   una m s   gracias   de nada   just like me     empty inside     cha  cha  cha      cha  cha  cha    where the hell you been   crime scene   what about these   the hotel cokehead murders  this dealer and the girl   oh   well  this hallmark looking couple  didn't die by the hands of a professional   no  this is child's play   messy work     all that blood on the walls looks like a finger painting   you give me the fucking creeps  you know that  dexter   yeah  i know   sorry about that   fuck you   okay   is there something i can do   you can give me a fucking analysis on the blood spatter   you think i'm here to invite you to my nephew's bris   i didn't know you were jewish   shut the fuck up and write your report already   don't even know why i need you   grab a crayon  psycho  and scribble this down   rival dealer came in   two scumbags slashed to hell  dealer stole the drugs   wham  bam  done   and i don't give a shit what you say  because that's what happened and that's who i'm looking for   hey  we are looking for a motherfucking thief dealer   you got it   okay  sure   i guess   but i should get over there   then get over there already  you fucking weirdo   i need it quick   i'm on it  sergeant   the only real question i have  is why  in a building full of cops   all supposedly with a keen insight into the human soul   is doakes the only one who gets the creeps from me   so this killer used a sword   uh  no   probably a very sharp knife   look at the blood spatter  look at the patterns   it tells a story   you see this big pond of blood right there   that's from the initial stab   the male victim was standing right here   and the killer plunged his knife into the shoulder   severing the carotid artery  and    blpph   notice the long  thick  heavy drips   yeah  nice   now  over here  you have nice  clean sprays of blood   that can only happen when you're holding something light  and moving quick    nice  sharp slices through the body   no splashes  no drips   clean and easy   this guy knew how to use a blade   so we're looking for a sushi chef   yeah  sushi chef is possible   wouldn't be my first choice  but  hey  you never know   now what   now i eat   the problem with eating and driving   which i love to do  is not being able to employ  the 10 00 2 00 hand position on the wheel   it's a matter of public safety   but there's always a sacrifice   this guy  jamie jaworski   six months ago  i think he fell in love with a pretty brunette   mrs  jane saunders     a sweet mother of two married to a successful banker     all living a pleasant life  until she  unfortunately  disappeared   leaving the kids emotionally devastated forever   the cops arrested my favorite valet   but his lawyer got him off on a faulty search warrant   it's a good thing i don't bother with them   animals don't like me  especially dogs   i don't think they approve  of what i sometimes do to their masters   that dog recognizes me  as easily as i can recognize jaworski  or any other killer   interesting taste in literature   his needs are evolving  turning violent   he's on the fast track   harry  have you ever wanted to kill anything else   you know  something bigger than a dog   yes   like a person   yeah  but no one in particular   why didn't you   i thought you and mom wouldn't like it   come here   friday night    date night in miami   every night is date night in miami   and everyone's having sex   but for me  sex never enters into it   i don't understand sex   not that i have anything against women   and i certainly have an appropriate sensibility about men   but when it comes to the actual act of sex   it's always just seemed so     undignified   but i have to play the game   and after years of trying to look normal   i think i met the right woman for me   deb saved her life on a domestic dispute call   introduced us   and we've been dating for six months now   she's perfect because rita is  in her own way   as damaged as me   i'm running late  i'll just be a sec   i have to change   okeydoke   hi  dexter   may i say that you look lovely this evening   okay   master cody  handsome as ever   high five   do the space shuttle   vanilla     chocolate  and strawberry   no coffee   which one do you think melts faster   ready   rita's ex hubby  the crack addict   repeatedly raped her  knocked her around   ever since then  she's been completely uninterested in sex   that works for me   cody  will you be back   of course i'll be back   i meant dexter   you'll be asleep   no  i won't   then i'll stop in and we'll all play cards   texas hold 'em   give mommy a kiss   ready   yeah   needless to say  i have some unusual habits   yet all these socially acceptable people  can't wait to pick up hammers  and publicly smash their food to bits   normal people are so hostile     but not her   where are we going   they might need me   just stay right there  i'll be right back   son of a whore   who   talking about this hijo de puta   this asshole killer   this maric n savage  who makes us work on a friday night   only mondays through thursdays     that's what i always say   of course  co o  be reasonable   who wants to work on a friday night   i have my needs   so   c mo est s  what are you doing here   i was in the neighborhood  i'm on a date   a date  nice   same guy  same pattern   bone dry  no blood again   pero mira esto   there's some small differences in the cuts this time   over here    rough  almost emotion   then over here  not so much   and then over here    clean   muy bien   yeah  nice  but look at this   all bone   the killer flayed the skin  the flesh  completely off   now  why would he do that   he's experimenting   he's trying to find the right way   is he experimenting with the head  too   what do you mean   la bestia left her tits and took her fucking head   i don't find anyone around here   and god only knows what he's doing with it   he's certainly raising the bar   damn   this guy is good   will they catch him soon   i doubt it   the killer is an artist   what do you mean   his technique     is incredible   i'm sorry  i don't think i want to   i mean  i'm    i'm not ready   damn it  dexter   what have i done now   and why can't i get that neat stack of body parts  out of my head   no blood   why did i touch her that way   i need to get back to my work   jaworski's website  scream bitch scream     the mother of all rape sites   that's it   he's definitely the one   now it's just a matter of time  before he becomes a drop of blood  in my glass slide collection   but i have to wait   i have to be careful and follow the code of harry   hey  dad   i can explain   you and i had an understanding   whenever you get an urge  you come to me  you tell me   and we deal with it together   i do tell you  dad  the hell you do   there's blood on this knife   animals  i find animals  that's all   are you sure   are you telling me the truth  yes   i thought we had this under control   you still don't remember anything from before   you know  before we took you in   no   is that why i have these urges   what happened changed something inside you   it got into you too early   i'm afraid your urge to kill is only gonna get stronger   you're saying i'll be like this forever   you're a good kid  dex   you are   otherwise  it would have been a lot worse than animals   okay  we can't stop this   but maybe     we can do something to channel it   use it for good   how could it ever be good   son  there are people out there who do really bad things   terrible people   and the police can't catch them all   do you understand what i'm saying   you're saying they deserve it   that's right   but  of course  you have to learn how to spot them   how to cover your tracks   but i can teach you   dad     it's okay  dex   you can't help what happened to you   but you can make the best of it   remember this forever     you are my son   you are not alone  and you are loved   okay   preparation is vital   no detail can be overlooked   and the ritual is intoxicating   duct tape     rubber sheets     necessary tools of the trade   you can't bullshit me  dex   help me out   laguerta still has me interviewing hookers   it's a waste of time   deb  if he was interrupted     think   jesus christ  right   because then how do you have time to wrap all the pieces   she's dumber than the boat people   throw her a fucking raft   but now we have a fourth body  and the cuts were different   and that's telling us a story   the ritual is changing   he's looking for some kind of inspiration and not finding it   so he keeps doing it until he gets it right   i could be wrong   so how the hell was your date with rita last night   great   you should try it sometime  you need a life   well  find me a guy i can trust   i need a transfer to homicide  bro   then we'll see about a life   it certainly would sound better  for the kids to say   mommy's on homicide    don't make me hit you   come on   then we could talk about more little morgans   nephews and nieces   you sound like mom   i just    tell me what you know about cell crystallization   what do you mean   i heard the coroner say it last night   he was talking about that dead     the headless chick   you got that look in your eye   i was there before you   and i noticed this body looked different than the other ones   the pieces were cold   they were  like  meat packing cold   is that what cell crystallization means   my god  why didn't i think of that   it's beautiful   dex   what are you thinking   sorry   that makes sense   cold   it slows the flow of blood   why the hell is that important   it's just a feeling   that's not good enough   i got to show laguerta and her boys   they're making fun of me   they're saying  the only way i can close a case is on my back   i got to get out of vice   dex  please  you got to     refrigerated truck   what the fuck are you talking about   a refrigerated truck   he wants a cold environment to slow the flow of blood   clean and mobile so he can dump the garbage afterwards   so i'm looking for a refrigerated truck now   probably a stolen one   you think there are a lot of stolen trucks out there   are you nuts  in miami   choir    kids     just do something   just find my husband   ma'am  the detectives are looking into everything   i'm pretty sure i covered all my tracks   what do you care about that woman   i don't  i was just     you like when women cry   you like that   what's your thing  psycho   i was just heading to the briefing room   you got no call to be in there  so flee   lieutenant  this fucking guy doesn't belong   i'm still waiting for his spatter report  on the cokehead murders    go do that   it's okay  i don't want to upset anybody   he can stay   i'd like your input   and we'll discuss your case after the meeting   how about we get started    encontr ste algo  nada todav a   hazme un favor y qu tate la gorra   disc lpame   you ready   i'm gonna shame this bitch   just state your case clean and easy   you'll be the hero   okay  settle down   now  has anyone tracked down that witness   oh  come on  people   someone needs to find something here   uh  lieutenant laguerta   oh  officer morgan   i didn't recognize you with your clothes on   i have an idea  something in a different direction   an idea   well  please  share it with us   cell crystallization   excuse me   a little more confidence  please   um     on the last victim   i'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks  have been stolen in the last    week or so   refrigerated trucks like ice cream trucks   um     no  not ice cream trucks   a refrigerated vehicle  that could cause that kind of tissue damage   a refrigerated truck that's mobile  so he'll be harder to catch   a refrigerated truck that might give us a lead   that's very interesting  very creative   let's keep looking for the witness  okay   we know that he or she is out there   the forensic evidence   the interrupted cut proves that there was an eyewitness   now  somebody out there saw something   so let's concentrate on finding that person  okay   but    just keep talking to all your hookers   that's all for today   what the fuck was i supposed to say   the only reason i'm in here  is because the captain said they had to let me in   but he didn't say they had to listen to you   well  right again   so say adi s to my career  i'm gonna die a meter maid   stop it  deb  there's another way   find the truck   excuse me  dexter    my office  please   what the hell   what the fuck   are you boning her   no  oh  my god   deb  wait   shut up   it had nothing to do with drugs   l t   this is a waste of our damn time   i think sergeant doakes is right   i read the other reports  all the other forensic analysis   everyone agrees the cokehead murders  had nothing to do with cocaine   it was a crime of passion   the murderer came to kill the woman  not the dealer   he did him quick and got him out of the way   but he sure as hell took his sweet time slicing up that lady   and you don't do that unless you have a close   personal relationship with someone   probably an ex boyfriend   that's who i'd look for   okay   it's a bit of a push   but  sergeant  you should check it out   i'm watching you  motherfucker   jaworski's been coming here for weeks     likes to steal all the copper plumbing   there's good money in that   no security guards    that's good   fuck  talk   what do you mean   i think you know what i mean  no   oh  god   talk to me about jane saunders   okay   i did her   how   in a movie    snuff film   but i'm not sorry   of course not   no  i'm not sorry  either   hello   hey  i'm    i'm sorry   i mean  i'm sorry about the other night   but  uh    look  dex   i really  really need to see you   so can you    can you come by later   you know  just for  like  a little while   i mean  i'm really     all right  what are you doing now   i'm just finishing up a little project   but i'll come by later   okay  bye   all in all  it was a good night   one less amateur filmmaker polluting the internet   no way   give us a minute   hanging in there   this will teach me to tailgate   let's go over this again   i'm all yours   so all the ice trucks in miami     bit of a coincidence  don't you think   sure  during business hours   but this time of night  a truck like that sticks out   and you followed it   that's right   you never saw the driver   just high beams and a flying head   so then he must have already had the head with him  in the front seat   that's weird  why would he keep it there   i don't know  so he could use a carpool lane   it just seems odd   your sister has this ice truck theory   and then here you are to back it up   she's good  lieutenant  you should give her a chance   you know  you should call me maria   but i'll tell you who's good    you are   doakes picked up the killer in the cokehead murders   you were right  it was her boyfriend   of course  doakes still hates you   of course   tell me  dexter   how did you get to be so smart  huh   mm     lots of sleep   is it okay if i fill out that report tomorrow   sure thing  you're tired   good night  lieutenant   i'll catch you later   dex   it's been a while   i'm sorry   i was worried   i didn't know what to do   i called in sick   i mean     are you okay   yeah  i'm fine  i was just     i'm sorry  there was another    you know   oh   well  the kids slept over next door   okay   would you like to come in   okay   okay   i don't want to lose you  dex   okay  sure   and     well    i want you   i mean     oh   okay   thanks   you're welcome   do you mind   um  no   it could be the kids   better get it  then   hello   cody   cody  stop crying  sweetie   all right  i'll come get you   cody just threw up all over colleen's couch   i got to go get him   tell me we're okay   better than   okay   go be a good mom   okay  that was close   i'll admit  making out with rita was     interesting   but if i don't keep a lid on this   it could be the end of us   i suppose i should be upset   even feel violated   but i'm not   no   in fact  i think this is a friendly message   kind of like   hey  want to play    and  yes  i want to play   i really  really do     oye  cayuco      oye  mi cha  cha  cha      pero mira  baila  baila cayuquito      como t  goza mi cha  cha  cha
