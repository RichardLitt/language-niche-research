   1 my name is leonardo da vinci   you're the eccentric that verrocchio employs   i'm an artist and an anatomist and an engineer of some note   search for the book of leaves  fate has chosen you   where do i start my search   the hanged man   the jew that was hanged   i want to unearth his body   my mistress insisted that you be the one to capture her beauty     i sense the vatican's hand behind this   you need weapons of your own your magnificence   this will greatly increase your firepower   the medicis have employed him to design siege weapons   you know this how  i have an agent  within lorenzo's ranks       davinci's demons 1x02     the serpent original air date on april 19  2013     sync  corrected by elderman            he told you time is a river   he told me the river was circular   that one man's death paves the way for the birth of another   indeed  and men like ourselves   we can change the river's course   i'm like you  then   i find that hard to believe   you don't know who i am  do you     my brother and i    your bandits tried to take my honor     where    down the path  to the left     hurry    this way   in you go  go on  in   alright   you should be safe in there   come on   i'm sorry   the fools locked the gate   the fools are worth worrying about   a locked gate       not so much   there is no yesterday  you see   no tomorrow   time is all one single continuum   we have met  haven't we   of course  we're brothers   who are you   start with your heel  roll to your toe     i already have a maestro    keep da vinci's counsel   but enhance it   there   what is it   they don't like their graves being violated   so they cover them in sand and letters to alert them of mischief   what does it say   funnily enough     'taken '  i'm a son of earth and starry heaven   i'm thirsty   please     give me something to drink from the fountain of memory   see  as i have seen       into infinity       and you will be a god   but know this   you will   suffer        one corpse   freshly plucked   was it a nightmare  maestro   no  it was something else entirely   take notes  would you   i perceive the expected marks from strangulation   crushed larynx   nico   diminished musculature  likely from malnutrition   circumcised member   i've never seen one of those before   what is that   a missing fingernail  on the right digitus primus   leo  what are you doing   the turk said to start my quest with a hanged man   specifically  the seat of the soul   it's a euphemism for the stomach      the missing fingernail   odd that he would ingest it       oh       one man's death  opens the doorway for another     did your husband give you that   it's a family heirloom   from ceylon   it's a stone called serendibite   what's troubling you   count riario is coming to pay us a visit   for what purpose   oh  nothing pleasant  i'm sure   but i'll be expected to wine and dine him   whilst hosting the rest of florence's elite   will you come   you can keep riario entertained   will clarice be there   of course   we can steal glances throughout the evening     i'll even invite that scoundrel  if you like   da vinci   the one who's supposed to be painting your portrait   and building me a weapon     you're late  son   contract   signed   and now binding     did you not even read it    we'd agreed the terms   but not the administration of those terms   i told you to stay away   i let you know there would be consequences   what do you think you've done   painting lucrezia donati   fraudulently leading the medicis to believe you can deliver preposterous weapons   you've overreached  and now i've made it so you'll soon be gone   there isn't a contract you can devise that can contain me   you're the bastard son of a servant girl i spilled my seed into   your heritage contains you        no     what's wrong    what's changed   something's shifted in you since last we met   perhaps it's just you and me here in lorenzo's home   feeling guilty   it's not as if i don't have affection for him   or perhaps       i'm guilty about feeling guilty   it's not as if i don't have affection for you as well   which guilt do you prefer  then   i have known lorenzo since i was a girl  i've known you a week     that's not an answer    well     the jew they executed     what was his offence   he said he had to run from cut throats     and he took refuge in a bookstore   the authorities suspect he stole something   but nothing was missing   and the bag he carried was empty   so  they hanged a man     for stealing something that wasn't missing   the scene of the crime requires further investigation   does it       prepare the horses   i want to be off at once   oh     you've finished already   yes  signor da vinci had somewhere to be   ah  yes  he's testing his gun for us   today he gives florence its sting       while i show him mine   it's quite considerate he left us a moment to be alone   mmm      lorenzo  anybody could walk in   i just needed a bit of you   and you will have it     for it is yours alone     good luck today    we're off   good luck   that bit of you     it's not his alone   no   it's not   but it will always be his first   do you have any saltpeter   what do you need potassium nitrate for   gunpowder  the maestro's designing a weapon   he calls it the pipe organ musket   the recoil will kill him   don't worry  he's worked it out   by god   he's corrupted you already   over there  third shelf  between the vermillion and the ultramarine   and tell him i expect to be paid in coin   not idle boasts  like last time   come on     god    careful  giuliano   fucking hell  what are we doing here  in the middle of nowhere     where is he    perhaps he's simply late   or perhaps he realized what he proposed was more than a flying party trick   i wouldn't be surprised if he had no intention of coming here   i'm telling you   the man's a lunatic and a coward   god  shit   keep control of yourself   they're only cut outs   quickly  soldiers advancing on florence   how   how dare you   you are pointing a weapon at the house of medici   men  take him     hold    it passed its first test     it's done nothing    no  it's done a great deal   intimidation   now  if you will proceed to the gallery        we will proceed to testing its less ephemeral utility   you've picked quite a day for it        yes  you like it   i think it adds to the verisimilitude   i question the company the maestro keeps   that man's a known reprobate   are these soldiers meant to be swiss     and you would be       commander quattrone   leader of the florentine militia   his magnificence thought it wise  to bring a military strategist along   in order to better evaluate your work     i wish i'd brought a boat    well  he has a keen eye   what you see here is a representation of rome's private mercenary regiment   it's a bit of theatrics   but often presentation is more than half the performance   well  get on with it  da vinci   while you delay  we drown     where was i    yes  come on   quickly  soldiers advancing on florence     yes  yes  yes    the man is mad       the house of medici has invested hundreds of florins in this project   according to your contract  the failure of this contraption  constitutes fraud   men  take him away   on your feet  maestro   hold   you have one week  artista   lorenzo  no   the materials alone will cost another 200 florins   one week    that sounds   quite reasonable      i'll have two  if the price is right   i'm gonna have words with you  boy   we found footprints in the graveyard where the jew's body was stolen   a donkey's  a man's and a child's   long toed poulaines     such as you are wearing     do you know who i am   i am lord girolamo riario   count and captain general of the holy roman church   nephew of his holiness       pope sixtus iv   signor morgante has informed us of your grave robbing exploits     i don't know what you mean    don't insult us  boy   we're well aware of who your master is   erm   your excellency  there was the matter of payment   hmm   yes  of course   captain grunwald       jesus     now that we've established my propensity for directness   i trust our conversation will proceed smoothly   now  we're interested in why da vinci required the jew's body   and  lest you be tempted to feign further ignorance   i wanted to demonstrate a remarkable device  i recently acquired from the orient   it's called    the widow's tear     no   the source of the discomfort you're feeling is an exquisitely tooled  diamond needle  the titular widow's tear   and as i turn the handle  the diamond         slowly incises a circle of skin   from the back of the hand  one layer of epidermis at a time     now  i want you to weigh your next answer very  very carefully   why did da vinci unearth the jew's body   very well  another turn     stop  stop  stop   shhh  shhh  it's alright  nico   just a few simple words  and we can end all this unpleasantness   he was searching     the jew swallowed something   what  child   a key   leave nothing unturned  just find the key    rip it apart   stop   you won't find it     that's what you're looking for     open it    i can't  it's locked   hack it apart     wait a moment    let's get out of here  hurry   let's get out of here   you  boy     you      you have defied instruments of the lord's will         leonardo   go  go   leonardo  are you alright   oh   oh  merciful heaven  what happened here   these men are agents of the papacy   what  it wasn't enough to tangle with the medicis  now you're      leo  you're talking about the pope   not to worry  they could only have our entrails torn out   nico  who did this to you   count riario   the papal nephew and attack dog   he snatched me from the market   i told him    i'm sorry   i told him you took the key from the jew's body   well  you may have told them that  but you showed them something else   hey  you've done something exceptional  nico   you've saved your own life  into the bargain   halt   be still   our visitor was expected   you know i can't be seen with you  there are too many prying eyes   if i had been stopped on the road     you needn't lecture me on the necessity of discretion   i wouldn't jeopardize such a valuable asset as yourself without ample reason   now  take these   a list of secure locales hidden throughout florence   i need more information   details of lorenzo and da vinci's activities   if you have something pertinent to convey   inscribe the greek letter alpha  above whichever locale is convenient   if we have something to convey to you   we will inscribe the letter omega   are you clear on all this   that's the official papal seal   mark your messages with it   and one final thing   what is it   instructions will be forthcoming   in the meantime  keep it hidden   now  da vinci     has your celebrated artist made any mention of a key     what about the jew    he asked about his capture   he wanted to return to the scene of the crime   that's how he put it   he was preoccupied with why a jew would hide in a bookshop   why would da vinci concern himself with a bookshop   i don't know  perhaps da vinci is more clever than you   but then that would be heresy  wouldn't it   keep an eye on that bookshop   if we're lucky  da vinci will complete our investigations for us   and you  miss donati   do continue ensnaring lorenzo and da vinci with that     pretty little cunt of yours     you're a bastard    yes   and the architect of my pedigree  is the holy father himself   now  go  lest the prying eyes of florence see us together  and question your already compromised character   she grows more impertinent with every encounter   hmm   even a mouse occasionally bears its teeth when it's about to be crushed   scudos  the papal currency   let's review the events again  da vinci   they took the boy and ransacked your workshop   what were they looking for   my weapon designs   well  let rome have them  by this time next week  they'll have decimated themselves   by this time next week  they could decimate us     lorenzo      open your eyes  brother   we no longer enjoy milan's protection   i want your men to surround this building   no one to come in or out  save da vinci and the boy   you will accompany da vinci wherever he goes   oh  i hardly think that's necessary     go   you have three days for a successful fire of your gun   if it fails  there will be no second chances   there will be no trial  you will hang   whatever you need to accomplish this you will possess   money  materials  men   make your vision real  da vinci       for your very life   when the black hood pulls the lever     be sure to clench    those guards are going to make it difficult to sneak off to the tavern     did you hear what he said    yes    i need to think   and if i need to think  i need to drink   this place is wonderful   so much better than the convent   a million thanks to you  leonardo   what are you doing   i'm trying to envisage what kind of lock the notches on this key correspond to   nico  do you have that coin the turk gave you   ahh   i thought so   two keys   whatever lock this corresponds with  i'd wager  the key represents only half of the mechanism needed to open it   leo  honestly  who cares   just give the damn thing to riario   inspiration can't be forced   oh  well  tell that to the hangman    hangman  inspiration cannot be forced  look  the fact that riario would jeopardize a formal visit to acquire this  is telling   obviously  it's linked to the book of leaves  the turk confirmed it   of course  the turk  your mystery man   yes  and since we have a mystery here       i intend to see it through   what mystery  the jew stole a key   he swallowed it to prevent his pursuers from getting it   why would he break into a bookshop   that's where the key was in the first place  that's why he broke in   no  the narrative doesn't hold up   the bookshop reported nothing missing     oh  for fuck's sake    and his bag was empty   and why the fingernail  and why was the jew being pursued       before the bookshop   according to the count  the jew crossed the piazza  and then entered the road here   perhaps someone witnessed the event   please  signor  can you offer any charity   tell me  good man   were you here the night the jew was caught   indeed i was  for this is my home  and i have no other   can't you see this man's blind   shhh        a florin  signor   you could identify that by its sound   i am well versed in the respective tones of our realm's coinage   if you would  could you describe what you heard that night   with pleasure  it was a cold night   when i first heard the shouts  i thought i was dreaming   they were coming from the duomo   then i heard the jew's footsteps and his breath   he was terrified  i could tell that   then he fell   dropped something  pages fluttering like bird's wings   then i heard the jew say  'wo  wo '  wo  wo   and i heard more shouts  his pursuers calling after him   i did not understand a word they said  except for 'halt'   halt   how does this shed light on your mystery   the men chasing the jew spoke a foreign tongue  yet they used the word 'halt'   only german and english use that     so       so  the swiss mercenaries  employed by rome speak german   and they must have assumed the jew understood it   since most jews speak yiddish  a form of german   the word 'wo' in yiddish means 'where'   the jew wasn't fearful  he was searching for something   see  i believe he had two items in his possession   the first was small enough for him to swallow   the key   the second was larger   forcing him to find a hiding place     a book    precisely   and where would one best hide a book   would you mind skulking around  making the proprietor apprehensive   why me   well  because you reek of dishonesty    as usual   signor vesticci  how goes it   tell me   how many rows of shelves do you have   ten  what of it   you there   did you just stuff something into your robes just now   i beg your pardon  i was simply hefting the weight of this tome   the fingernail was a clue to the second item's location   ten shelves  ten fingers   now  we're facing the west   it would be more obvious  when counting  to face  the opposite direction   the east and the rising sun   additionally  hebrew is the sacred language of the jews   read from right to left   so  if we count from the right       we get row number five   blood   now  we know he bit off his fingernail   look  nico  there   dust  no one's disturbed these books in ages   but here     there's no dust at all on this book   written in hebrew  no less   i think we've found item number two   i take it all back  if you had tits  i'd marry you   so  you long for the soul of a man but the breasts of a woman   you have a treacherous road ahead  my friend   artista  you will come with us   if you resist    well  just ask your little friend about riario's hospitality   well  unfortunately  we will have to decline the count's invitation   what is that   well  you're acquainted with my infernal devices   the exploding chest  in my workshop   well  this works on the same principle   it is a grenado  it's packed with gunpowder   activated by a push button on its base   and if i remove my thumb        the device will explode   he's lying  it's a snuff box   don't test my resolve  i do not care for you to die   on this day or any other   you think the greatest mind in all of europe needs to bluff  then try us   there's a vendor nearby that sells those things   this is da vinci you're staring down     it's a snuff box    it's a fucking grenado     fuck me    split up   after him   halt  you won't get away from us   halt   halt   stay where you are     got him    shit   shit   stop         oh  please  give riario my regrets     count riario  if you'd be so kind   signor di medici   lady orsini   thank you most humbly for the hospitality  you've extended to our modest delegation   we are only too happy  to receive rome's favored son   lord girolamo   we are ecstatic   shall you and i retire to my study for a few moments   drop the niceties  riario   your men broke into my artist's studio   i want to know why   word of da vinci has reached the holy father's ears   he's tasked me with finding artisans to adorn the great chapel he's building   i thought     do you know what   an exploratory meeting might be in order   and was the death of your men part of that exploration   only retroactively  but it taught me a few things about your man  and made me anxious to make his acquaintance   da vinci is a mere dilettante   an amusement  nothing more   and yet i'm told you've advanced him a stipend  of 50 florins   quite a handsome allowance for a mere dilettante   rome hears every whisper  lorenzo   even outlandish ones concerning artisans capable of constructing war machines   the manufacture of armaments could be construed as a provocative move   as could the assassination of duke sforza   or the refusal to pay one's debts   usury  it's such an unseemly business   i hear the holy father is now borrowing money from the pazzi family   is he planning on bilking them as well   since we're on the subject of provocations   i believe it's time i stated the purpose of my visit   his holiness wishes to inform you of his choice for the archbishop of pisa   pisa falls under florence's jurisdiction   nevertheless  the selection has been made   his holiness has appointed francesco salviati     your cousin    hmm   well     it appears congratulations are in order   please  inform the holy father  that you and salviati should assemble the largest army you can find     because the only way you're setting foot in pisa  is if i am dead and buried   i see   so  that's your proposed condition   rome fired the first salvo  not i   and we intend to fire the last   good night  magnifico   how in christ's name  did he know all that   troubling       you look very fetching in your night shirt   what are you doing  skulking around  i could have hurt you   with a drafting compass   why are you here  leonardo   i can't go to my quarters  the vatican's thugs are looking for me   lorenzo's men have been in and out of here all day  looking for you   lorenzo gave me a deadline on my musket   frankly  i'm not sure i can make it   i'm not surprised   you have three layers of cannons on top of one another  yes   mm hm   well  there's going to be some powder contamination between the tiers   look  i promised lorenzo a musket that could be fired and loaded simultaneously   this is a dangerous game you're playing with lorenzo  have you overreached   christ  andrea  the whole point of progress is overreaching   why doesn't anyone understand that   drink   now  do you want to tell me what this is all really about   have you heard of the book of leaves   it's a myth  no more real than a unicorn     i believe it exists    a book of wonders   containing the secret history of the world  please   the jew that was hanged  hm   this was his   your hebrew's better than mine  perhaps you can tell me what it concerns   it's   it's a treatise on the origins of the universe   astronomy   it keeps referring to the vault of heaven   how it can be opened   or perhaps    ah ha   so  the vault of heaven could refer to the night sky   so  perhaps the book can be found by looking for a constellation   leo  give up on this fool's errand  and focus on your commission   stop borrowing trouble based on a fable   this fable     is bound up in the fate of my mother   i can draw anything i've seen  andrea  anything   but i can't draw her face   i've tried  i can't   i can't  i just can't remember it   if there's any knowledge to be had of her  bound up in this quest       i need to see it through   then your need will most likely end up getting you killed   hmm     he told me the linens were from naples   isn't that right  dear   me  a textile merchant   i suggested he start getting his wine from the orient  while he's at it   shouldn't you be working on lorenzo's musket   well  unlike you  i'm capable of doing two things at the same time   drinking and digging your own grave   yours   the question you asked of me earlier   which gift do i prefer   you seem very uncomfortable   i don't often attend affairs such as this   well  i do  it's a confection of pretence and masks   smile  lorenzo's watching us     your pardons and indulgences  your pardons and indulgences   welcome  all of you       to a feast of florence   so full of life and vibrancy     so like eden     full of fresh fruits   full of bird and game   full of nature's grace       so like eden     but  of course  eden had guests     as do we      of course  our guest is somewhat more pleasant than the serpent     please let us welcome count girolamo riario   emissary from rome   to our eden  to our florence   dinner is served     what do you see   i know who you are  you know who i am  we both know what's transpired   now  tell me  what do you see   i believe i saw someone call you a snake in front of all those people   and i see a key that you will be giving to me       along with what you took from that bookstore   well  both the key and the book the jew hid are quite useless   unless one has the intellect required to find the vault of heaven     then i'll have you as well    why would i  surrender myself to rome   perhaps you value your life   not enough to betray florence   then     perhaps you value the life of another a little more   i know desire when i see it   and i am very well versed in the myriad ways  of exploiting it   you know  this doesn't have to be contentious  da vinci   join us  and the whole of the vatican's secret archives  can be at your disposal   you're offering me forbidden fruit now   that's what serpents do  isn't it   meet me tomorrow at sunrise   and then the key  all of its secrets   can be yours   and your services   surely  if i'm to find the book of leaves  i'll need those  as well     what is he doing    he's playing with a bottle   of course he is   i'll admit he eluded us once   but this time we're ready for him     there  it makes sense   he was already working with the roman scum   do we need any more proof   he is complicit with them   consider this a retainer   for your services to rome   why do you hesitate  da vinci   this is the next step   sorry  i don't follow you   why did you exhume the jew   why do you endeavor to find the vault   i don't endeavor   i've found it   the vault of heaven  which  presumably  contains the book of leaves   i've had it put on wheels  so i might move it for safekeeping   apparently  it requires two keys to open   the jew  the vault  the book   you've done all this  because you want to know  what's next   between the base animal clawing for money  and the enlightened man's reach for god  lies knowledge   you just want to know what's next  i do too   oh  that's not what you want   you want to suppress knowledge   no  i want to administer it   someone has to  why not an agent of god   well  if god exists  surely  he intended his knowledge to be shared by all   the truth is  progress frightens you and your ilk    not at all  we embrace it   really   really   are we at an impasse  then   that would be unfortunate   this is your last chance for an amicable partnership   i decline your offer    i pledge allegiance to lorenzo the magnificent   his foolish brother   and the whole of florence   you want to tame florence   but i prefer it wild   for all its quirks and criminals   so  why don't you scurry on back to rome  and tell your pope that neither florence nor da vinci  will be contained       you hurt my friend   go  run  you fools       i'm sorry   i did warn you   why aren't we meeting at the palace   i come here to retreat from public life   and the words i would have with you aren't meant to be public   i believe there may be a spy in my court   riario knew the details of our arrangement   the exact amount of the stipend i've advanced you   you suspect my allegiance   no   no  the fact that you just killed six of the papal guard  releases you from the circle of suspicion   hmm   no  you wanted me to witness your meeting with riario today  didn't you   what makes you say that   well  you managed to evade my officers  even though i insisted they watch over you   and then today  conveniently  you slip up   you intended for us to track you to the quarry   i thought you'd appreciate seeing the gun work on real opponents  not wooden ones   how did you fix the gun's flaws   the cannons needed more separation   so the rotating drum i fashioned did just that   and can your musket now be produced on a large scale   well  given the resources  absolutely   then you will have them   you have done well  da vinci   we struck riario quite a blow today   but it won't be long before he retaliates   lorenzo  we don't have much       i thought we were alone    it's all right  lucrezia   it's only da vinci   and i trust we can rely on his discretion   absolutely   good man   get to work  maestro   florence is counting on you     why do you laugh   one day  lupo   all that you see here will fall under rome's rule   and if that day happens a bit further down the road   because of da vinci's intervention       so be it   but he has the key   that makes him one step closer to obtaining the book of leaves   let him keep it for now  at least we know where it is   and besides   the key is useless without its counterpart   and what if da vinci obtains that   he won't   how do you know   because i have it    and now you know  dear lupo       why i find the whole affair so amusing   why the long face  leo   the maestro's never satisfied
