good afternoon  greendale community college   i am your dean with a few corrections to the fall class catalog   cosmology should be cosmetology   astrology should be astronomy   and the students on the cover should be smiling   but that's a matter of opinion   whoever is growing a patch of cannabis behind the gymnasium   congratulations  you have won a cruise   report to security to claim your tickets   in order to increase awareness of homelessness   security has been given binoculars   in campus news   the debate over our library's pa system continues  with some students suggesting its volume be lowered   while others question its very purpose   more on that story as it unfolds     he makes a lot of announcements    i like it   every ten minutes feel like a new scene of a tv show   illusion only lasts until someone says something they'd never say on tv  like how much their life is like tv  there  it's gone   i guess jeff's running late again   what a shame  we should get started     we should wait for jeff before we start studying   but when jeff gets here   we could talk to him about his tardiness   don't use that word around abed   if you want me to have a chat with jeff  i'd be happy to do it   we've got a bond going  kind of  sorta like brothers   hope you didn't take baths together 'cause one of you would've been 30   that's funny   jeff probably comes late not to sit through your tardiness   sorry   will you have some self respect   you're obsessing over someone who does not give you a second thought   in guatemala  journalists are killed by their own government   you jumped a column  what's happening there     nothing    journalists are being murdered   believe me  every day in that country  people are killed for speaking out   the worst part of it is when it's over       spoilers    it would never even happened   real stories    they don't have spoilers   you understand that tv and life are different  right     milady    milord     baby    sweetie     you smell nice  vitamin p    morning  jeffrey   people were jazzed to see me too     word 'em up    word 'em everywhere     good entrance    that was for you   there's something that the group would like to tell you   actually  there's nothing     if you're gonna study with people  it would be cool to show up on time   were you waiting   talking about your personal lives and your cool emotional problems   i never have anything to offer   truth is my life is emptier than this three ring binder   you have any spanish notes that might fit in there   double spaced  thank you   what's a guy got to do to get a c around here   one liner    good studying  see you later  bye   you know what today is   the two week anniversary of my horrible first impression     there's a card for that    not specifically   but if you think of grandsons as a metaphor for friendship   you'll agree with this transformer here  that it's time for ours to become a man   by reading from the torah   you're harmless to me cause a life full of ups and downs  has given me douche ray vision  but those are good people in there   and they trust and respect you  watching you exploit them bums me out     exploit them  they're my friends    you want me to bring your car around   i don't want you to bring my car around   i'll bring yours around  good guy  you get going  all right   you're cute   but selfish and narcissistic to the point of near delusion   she said i was cute   tell you what  you take her  i have less to prove   you can't pursue people so desperately   it starts to creep them out   why don't we go get a beer  i'll give you some advice   and we can have what the kids calls a sausage fest   i'm not much of a sausage guy  maybe next time   next time  then     will you tell us more about guatemala    i never went to a real college   you should discover that stuff on your own   but we need your help   we've been living on the wrong side of the looking glass   you're like jodie foster or susan sarandon     you'd keep it real than be likeable    can you tell us what to google   you could start with this journalist chacata panecos   he wrote an article critical of the government  and they killed him     that's horrible    can we have a protest     i want to protest something    we could have a candlelight vigil    like lesbians have on the news    i could make brownies   brownies   every once in a while  a student come up to me and ask    se  or chang  why do you teach spanish    they say it just like that    why do you teach  spanish     why you    why not math   why not photography   why not martial arts   i mean  surely it must be in my nature  to instruct you in something  that's ancient and secret  like building a wall that you can see from outer space   i'll tell you why i teach spanish   it is none of your business  okay   now  i don't want to have any conversations  about what a mysterious and inscrutable man i am   i am a spanish genius   in espa  ol  my nickname is   el tigre chino    'cause my knowledge will bite her face off   so don't question se  or chang or you'll get bit   ya bit   ya bit   friday ma  ana  we'll have conversations with the rest of the class  using some of the phrases we learned in unit one   you'll be partnering up in pairs of dos   if you look under your desk   you'll find a card with either a picture or a word on it   for ejemplo  blondie aqui  has a card with a picture of a house on it   so that means the person with the card with the word casa on it is her partner   comprende  star burns   see you friday  find your partners  have a great day   what do we say at the end of every class   come on  hands     you want to trade cards   i'll give you 20 bucks     50 bucks    i don't want your money  your shirt     what    i've had my eye on it sincefirst day     fine  give me your card    i want to wear it out of here   what are the odds   are you sure you didn't adjust the odds   i know abed's been eyeing that shirt for three weeks   it's almost like you gave it to him so he would switch cards   i gave abed my shirt because i'm not selfish   which is something you'll discover while we are working on this   tomorrow night  dinner  drinks   i think that's something we should discuss with our partners   see  i did switch cards   can you believe this  what are the odds   that's a nice shirt  want to sell it   what's the moist towelette industry like   believe me  it's nothing like the product   it's a hard  dry  large business   destroyed all my marriages   it didn't help i can't have children  i'm not sterile   in fact  it's a rare condition they call  hyper virility    apparently my sperm shoot through the egg like bullets     can you believe that    i can't   but you can  so that's fine   the assignment is  to write a spanish conversation using those five phrases   hemingway's lemonade     no need to make it a long evening      am i a piece of garbage to you   what   got ya   let's have one drink before we work   to the  empowerage  of words   to the irony of that sentence   so what's up with you  jeffrey  seems like you got a burr up your ass   i guess that it's       it's britta    forget her   you just have to know her name  what is she  a water filter   she's ugly     why don't we start with me saying      what are you doing   our assignment   this is the first time people'll see winger and hawthorne together   we show them we're a force to be reckoned with   come on  let's brainstorm some story ideas   better yet  before we do that  let's ask ourselves       what is a story    my god in heaven   like that brownie  you'll hate what's up on in guatemala   google it   raise the truth   once it gets dark   i hand out the candles and we do a speechless protest   we put tape over our mouths   and gather hand in hand in a sea of outraged silence     what with you    this ain't how you do this   we know it's not how you do it cause we're doing everything   but this is tacky and lame   i didn't mean that   i'm sorry   what i meant to say  is that this cause is really personal to me   are you saying that we're not allowed to protest     you sound like guatemala    somebody has a case of   likes to use french politics to make themselves special    but doesn't actually ever want to do anything itis    i do things   i went to     i don't do anything   what can i do   you hang the chacata panecos pi  ata   you guys realize he was beaten to death  right   that's where we got the idea from   poignant     tell me what i've got so far    what we have so far   we have something incredibly long   and very confusing  and a little homophobic   and really  really  specifically   surprisingly  and gratuitously critical of israel   it's called  two conquistadors   should probably be  dos    i mean  it is a spanish class   which reminds me  the only thing not included in this  are the five phrases required to get me a passing grade   you're right  needs more work     what're you guys doing    i have no idea     we head to the demonstration    hippies     some cause britta's into    a silent protest  lots of candles   gets the ladies in the mood for social change     a chance to put miles on this shirt    conversations are due in the morning   right   what do you want to do   hacks   what do we do about the ending of act two   i tell you what we're gonna do   we gonna take this  and we gonna put it in a museum for crazy people   then we're gonna take this   and memorize five phrases from it tomorrow morning before class     good night    wait a minute   you're bailing on our first sausage fest   this is your definition of friendship   this is my definition of you trying way too hard   and me finding it harder and harder to stay polite   now this was a fine enough way to spend an evening devoid of hope   but a woman i kind of like  is out there caring about something stupid   and this is my chance to show her i care enough to act like i care too     that's all you had to say    that was it   that would've been great if i had done that two hours ago   nice sign   i like what you've done with the place   i think i was a little too harsh on you   i'm not perfect   i am  i'd be happy to show you the ropes   awesome   look at awesome jeffrey winger   too awesome for old pierce  with your hip shirts   and your gelled hair   and your cool  tape over your mouth   why are you wearing tape over their mouth   it's a protest   good   cause i know what i'd like to protest     how much you hurt me   conflicts like these will ultimately bring us together as an unlikely family     you have horrible breath right now    you constantly blow me off   you want me to do your homework   you tell me i'm trying too hard to be your friend so you have to go   you have to come out here to pretend  to care about the stupid stuff she cares about     his words  not mine    he is paraphrasing   pierce  i got an idea   get a coffee   hold some waitress hostage with a monologue about your sperm   i'll show you some sperm  buddy   was this your idea  what the hell  fire   i'm not ready to die   he's jumped in the fountain   he's fine     have you seen it    we did it  girl    page three   mostly about pierce  but listen to last paragraph    the incident occurred during a protest regarding events in guatemala      awareness    it's not the school paper   it's a real paper  there's a marmaduke in there   it's more than i ever accomplished   you know about the ethnic cleansing in burma   need to bust out brownie mix   morning   i get it  garfield's wishing me a happy arbor day     you'd like a fresh start    nice try   it's secretary's day  and it says i'm sorry about crashing your protest  with that drunken  self immolating baby boomer   we don't blame you  he has always been on my watch list   that dude is crazy    he told me girls have two pee holes   i sang christmas carols at a nursing home once   i've seen the face of dementia  and last night i saw it again   you know what he did that's really crazy   he offered me  100 to switch cards with him  just so he could be partners with jeff   he thought getting closer to jeff would bring him respect in the group   i think he spent his whole life looking out for himself  and he would trade it all for a shot at some kind of family   time for our presentations   first up was supposed to be jeff and pierce   but pierce explained the situation   apparently there was a falling out  things were said  people were betrayed   jeff  having heard pierce's side of the story   the only humane thing to do would be to give you a c  and let him do his presentation alone  if that sounds fair to you   that doesn't sound fair to me at all   i understand if you don't want to be my friend   but this thing we've created     it is bigger than the both of us   and it deserves to be done right   all right   why are there costumes involved  these are short conversations     they're not supposed to take      your breath away   well  tough   you ready  amigo   f   f minus   what   did you say s   so   that was one of the worst things i have ever seen   which i guess makes being a part of it a pretty selfless act   so i'm impressed   how do you know i didn't do it just to get another shot at you   cause a smart guy like you would know  no woman would be able to look at you as a sexually viable candidate  ever again   no  i know   i thought of that   she looked back   you did an all right job up there  my friend   you got this thing you do with your face when you're trying to be funny  that forces people to think about how cool you think you are                   it's 2009   word
