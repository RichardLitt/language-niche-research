pair of jacks   ace high   three cowboys   oh  my god  my wedding ring   oh  my god  oh  my god   now  you should all learn from pete's mistake   my wife's gonna kill me   you see  in poker as in business   the key to success is to determine  your opponent's strength and  more importantly  his weaknesses   everyone has a tell   a weakness of character  that manifests itself physically   oh   like when lutz here has a good hand  he stops eating   when frank is bluffing  he asks a series of insane questions to hide his nervousness   oh  really   is that what you think  is that what i do   am i doing that right now  yeah  i'm out   okay  rainman  tell me what i got   well  you have two of your cards backwards actually   i'm out   hi  pinot grigio  please   this is beyond the pale

that we're lesbians   i am a lesbian   mm  that's awesome   is this the first time somebody's made that assumption about you   lemon  don't let these girls give you a hard time about who you are   you know  you need to brush your teeth more  young man   oh  my  what an adorable little lesbian   what  i don't know   who remembers that kind of thing   well  look  obviously this is a miscommunication   i mean  i'm certainly not interested in chasing a straight girl   of course  yeah   i completely understand if you just want to go home   no  it's fine  i'll stay   jack is ridiculous   oh  i worked with jack in plastics   he tends to approach everything the same way   locate the problem  isolate the problem   set the problem up with a lesbian   that's a pretty good joke for somebody from plastics   well  i wasn't always in plastics   i used to work in water and process technologies   working mainly in primary metals   oh  so you have a comedy background   how was your evening with thomas   you mean  gretchen thomas  the brilliant plastics engineer lesbian   what made you think i was gay   your shoes   well  i'm straight   those shoes are definitely bi curious   regardless  i am straight   well  i'm sorry if i offended you   no  i'm not offended    g ood   what do you know about kenneth the page   i don't know  he's a sweet kid   yes   and a surprisingly good poker player   did you know that his middle name is ellen   no  that's weird   and that his myers briggs psychological testing shows shows a rare combination  of extroverted  intuitive and aggressive   really   the same as mine   he could be trouble down the line   kenneth   kenneth ellen   all right then   you're not a lesbian  duly noted   i'll correct that on your file   it's too bad  though  thomas thought you were great     she did    yes   she said she thought you looked like jennifer jason leigh   really  she said that   yes  i made her repeat it  i was sure she meant jason lee   miss lemon   yeah

sound really weird  but  um   do you every worry about choking to death  alone in your apartment   oh   it's so weird you would say that   i think about it all the time   i mean  you'd die  and they wouldn't find you  until your neighbor's dog smelled you from the hallway   ugh  yes  and they'd show a picture of you on new york one   and it's not just choking   ever since i turned 30  every time i get in or out  of the bathtub  i think in my head   careful  careful    yes   agh   everything's the worst   do you want to get some dinner   sure    see you in 20 at neptune   yeah  okay  perfect

'cause that chick is hot   we're just friends  like oprah and gayle   why is that so hard for everybody to believe   she's great  you should marry that girl   one problem  i'm not gay   oh  lemon  in the ten years that i've known you   you've had some really terrible boyfriends   i have   there was the guy who was obsessed with charlie chaplin   neil   there was the guy who played halo under the name slutbanger   dennis   there was a tall  gangly  red haired guy  who played guitar all the time   conan   you're more relaxed with gretchen than you were with any of those guys   so what are you saying  pete   i should just be a lesbian   well  i'm not saying it'll be easy   you know  get drunk first   why do guys think women can just flip a switch like that   what if i said to you   go be with frank now    ah  i would be honored   frank is a very tender  beautiful man   he's awesome   you can't read his thoughts  'cause he doesn't have any   i raise you 200   and i see your 200 and raise you 300   will you  little kenneth ellen parcell from stone mountain  georgia   growing up in your momma's tract house  dreaming of working on a tv show   dreaming of making it all the way to the nbc   you're scaring me  mr  donaghy   you've come a long way  haven't you  kenneth ellen   with your cheap loafers and your page jacket   but you'll always be a pig farmer's son  boy   'cause i smell fried bologna all over you   i'm all in   i'm out of chips  mr  donaghy   hey  i got a fun idea   you put your page jacket on the table   and if you win  you can get it back   if you lose  you go on home   you go on home  little kenneth ellen   all the way to stone mountain   he's bluffing  go for it   he's bluffing  come on  trust yourself   trust yourself  don't do it   no   you can do it   okay  okay   come on   use your instincts   you've got good instincts   do it  kenneth   i've got a pair of twos   well  let's just see weeby here   i've got a two  a four  a nine  a six  and a king   that means i win   kenneth   why did you bet that terrible hand   why   because   i believe that life is for the living   i believe in taking risks and biting off more than you can chew   and also  people were yelling   and i got confused about the rules   kenneth   i wasn't really going to fire you   i just wanted to remind you that i could   i want you back here at 6 00 in the morning sharp  so you can sweep up these shrimp tails   yes  sir  mr  donaghy   uh   i'm gonna have my eye on you  kenneth   you will not be disappointed  sir   well  it was nice of you to let him keep his job   the italians have a saying  lemon    keep your friends close and your enemies closer    and although they've never won a war   or mass produced a decent car  in this area  they are correct   in five years  we'll all either be working for him     or be dead by his hand   hey  after ikea tomorrow  you wanna go see margaret cho at the beacon   oh  boy  um  oprah   yes  gayle   i think we need to take a break   is this because i waused to submit us for the amazing race   because i was 80  joking about that   no  it's    you know  i said i'm not into chasing straight girls   and i kinda think that's what's starting to happen here   so    unless you're ready to make a big life change   i need to move on  find my steadman   i thought i was oprah in this metaphor   also  you're gay  so that's a little confusing   you should say  like   my lady steadman    okay   i'm going out on a limb here   okay  sorry   um  it's just    if i try to imagine us being together   i think   yeah  okay  this could be fun  you know    picking out furniture and making flower beds out of old railroad ties    but the thing is  if i'm gonna be with someone   it has to be a guy   you sound pretty sure about that   what can i say   i love a bald spot and a hairy back   you're alone there   i should go   i'll see you around   okay  wait   um  what if we made a pact   what if we say that in  like  25 years   if neither of us has someone   we'll move in together and be roommates   and even though i am not into the sex stuff   if it helps you    i would let you    do stuff to me   i can't be around you anymore   bye  liz   that's funny  that's what the guys always say   who's gonna go with me to cooking class next weekend   well  if by  cooking class  you mean your bed   and by  next weekend  you
