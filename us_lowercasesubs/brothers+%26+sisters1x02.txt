previously on  brothers and sisters   to kitty  with you home  the circle is complete   i was afraid of the things i didn't want to say   well  let's just say it  that i sent justin to war  that i put him on the front lines  that's ridiculous   he trusted you  he asked you   all right  so  dad  right  i'm at the office the other day and i saw something   her name's holly harper  she and dad have been friends for years   what if i can really make a difference   by being an 11 30 smartass on tv   dad  something's not right with the company   where did all the money go  saul   you think i have it   no  saul  we need to have something that makes sense   the pension funds     grandpa    get your grandmother  now   dad  what have you done       there's just no escaping him in this house   no  there never was   you know  i lived in new york for so long  i barely saw him  i shouldn't be missing him this much   of course you should  it's only been three weeks   three weeks    god   are you sure you wanna stay here   yeah  yeah  i have to   mom needs me   oh my god  i have so much stuff   i know  i'm starting to wonder what jonathan got in the break up   we are not broken up  kevin   this is just us  giving each other a little space   he wants me to be here  and he wants me to do the show   sure he does  so  when does the show start  anyway   tomorrow  we're discussing ballot tampering in the swing states  you better watch it   wow  who said politics isn't sexy   ok  i'm off to work   mommy  where's my grass skirt   oh my god   oh  don't tell me  you said that she would get it   mom  we're doing the states for school  i'm hawaii   hey  babe  what if we make one out of paper   i can't be hawaii without a grass skirt   you guys promised i could have one  a real one   you said that you'd go to the party store  you remember  we talked about this  i got lessons all day  i can't     i will  i will  i'll go today  see  i won't forget   i thought the whole point of giving up the big corporate job for the family business was  you know     so did i     hey  josh    cool  hi  mrs  whedon    aloha     so  any plans for the afternoon   you know  it is so funny     the minute the funeral was over  then virtually every single conversation over the past three weeks  has contained some variation of   are you keeping busy    are you filling your days    are you moving on    so are you   yes  yes   sometimes   and then  sometimes  it gets very  very quiet   but  kitty's moving in  that's    great   i have this idea  i think you should move in  too  and then the house would be really  really alive   i'm kidding     oh  god  don't do that    i'm kidding you   wow  you're on    you're actually early   your award is to help me carry heavy boxes up a long flight of stairs     mom  where's  ah   where's dad's address book   i just want to write manny over at rousseau's to say thanks for hiring me   honey  that's so sweet  just look in his rolodex  which is on his desk in his office   ok  great  thanks   you wanna help me with the boxes  no  later  ok    i'm fine   you know  i think he's turning over a new leaf  i      really do  i think he's doing so much better than     look at her reading habits  who knew there were so many biographies on ronald reagan   you know  this is such a bad idea  she should be in a nice little house  at least five miles away  with uniformed guards between you   just stop  i had to let her stay here   dad's gone  jonathan's back in new york  she needs me   what time is everybody else getting here  huh   i don't know why you had to make such a big deal out of this reading of the will  you could've just emailed everybody   that's the way it's done  ok  that's the way dad wanted it  so     god  what does she have in here  the original federalist papers   probably   i'm justin walker   i know who you are   i saw you at my dad's office the day before he died   um  we were doing business   i saw you again at the funeral   we were friends   i don't think so   see   i remember you from a long time ago   yes  you do   how long have you two  ah      long enough   who else knows about you and my father   saul   anyone else   no   i'm so sorry   before i show this to you   let's just remember that we're family and we all want the same thing  to get back to something good   here   what is this   tommy  you wanted proof that i don't bear all the responsibility of what happened to the company   well  here it is  if you look over here  you'll see that your dad sold a million dollars of his own stock in the company to the pension fund   right  i see that  so   he made the pension fund pay him  15 million for it   he inflated the value of the stock   and now the company is on the verge of bankruptcy   why would he do something like this   it doesn't make sense   we have to find out   no  the first thing we have to do is go to the authorities   sarah  you can't do that   don't you think i would have done it   i want you to think about your mother   how would she respond to this   no  we can't tell anyone in the family about this  anyone   what is it that you're suggesting we do  saul   i'm suggesting we do what families do  we stick together   we rebuild  we go back to where we were  we repay the debt together  and move on   together  as a family   as a family of criminals   no  no  i won't   i won't do that   ok   ok  well  we have to go to your mother's   yeah    let's see what else the man left us     hey    hey     hey    look at you  the family lawyer   you've got your bad news face on   no  i don't   yeah  this is like when dad had you sent in to tell me bingo had been hit by a car   bingo     he loved to chase things   this is not like bingo   let's hope not   this isn't going to be like bingo  is it   don't ask me that   the last piece of company business to be addressed is  of course  the line of succession at ojai foods   justin     sorry  kit   saul stays on as chief financial officer   as it should be   tommy continues as vice president of operations and sarah is to be president of the company   all personal assets obviously     dad's wishes  guys  ok   all personal assets obviously go to mom     and if   and when mom dies     thank you for the  if  kevin  it was really sweet   you got it  ah   the entire trust is then passed on  equally  to all of us  with one notable exception   and uh  i apologize for having to be the one to say this to you     what    dad set it up so     after mom's gone     your share of the inheritance will be kept in a conservatorship   which is what  like a museum   no  you'll get an allowance  and  um  and kitty will be the     what  the babysitter   conservator   he knew how close you two are  so he     he figured     what  that i was too messed up to handle my own finances     no    no  i mean that's it  right  i'm an idiot   no     when you're high like you are right now  yes    you know what  go to hell  tommy   why don't you go to hell   guys  guys   you know  justin  we'll   we'll work something out   you know  it's ok  fine  right  i mean  this is what dad wants  you know  it's freaking perfect   kevin  why didn't you tell me this before   because i'm acting as a lawyer now  ok  not as a son  i'm sorry   justin  honey  don't go  please   you know  i gotta go to work  mom   that's what i deserve  right  i mean  i'm not as good as the rest of you  you're all such saints   i don't want his money  anyway  thanks for the heads up today   bingo   brothers   sisters  1x02  i was just a receptionist  but even i could see it was fraud   and how exactly did you find out there was fraud taking place at mangopian insurance  mr  wandell   because whenever i was bored  which was always  i eavesdropped on the salesmen's calls   what did you hear    that many   did anyone ever ask you to lie   oh my god  oh my god  you're gay   if you could answer the question  'cause these guys have lawyers that will shred you   i'm not being prepped anymore until you admit you're a gay   yeah  yeah  i am  a  gay  so   i mean  whatever   how did you know   so  you're like all in the closet  in this day and age   ah  no  actually  i'm not in the closet at all  i'm open and proud   you're not proud  you're trying to pass   wow  is this your boyfriend   ex   you looked much happier when you were younger    and gayer   you know  i'm having a not great day  i don't know if that matters to you  so can we just do this   not even the house   i understand everything   but he didn't even leave me my house   holly   it's all right   how could he   it's all right  i knew the rules   women don't have affairs to be remembered in the will  that's why they get married   but  it does mean something    that you came to see me  to tell me   that you care   i do  i do care   it's what makes  this  so difficult  holly    this    triangulation   look  holly  i love my sister   and i think that that makes a friendship     between us   impossible   yeah   i would have to lie to them  and i've had my fill of lying   i think you have  too   my sister  my nieces  and nephews   already justin has  i'm all they have now   i can't subject them to any more deception   no  of course you can't   oh  hi  mannyi  i'm sorry  the damn smoke alarm is going off   no  no  there's no fire  manny   would i be standing here talking to you if there were a fire   listen  i do wanna thank you and everyone at rousseau's for  for hiring justin   yeah  it's times like these that we really know who are friends are  that's for sure   and he seems to be doing so well   i'm sorry  manny  you'll have to speak up  i can't hear you   what   he didn't show up today   he hasn't shown up all week   oh  yes  of course you have to let him go   i understand   you certainly did try   thanks  manny   it's basically one family's war  they're just making the whole country pay for it   bush  sr  never wanted baghdad   oh  no  he just wanted to protect the kuwaitis  right  come on   you know  if we inherited this war from anybody  it was bill clinton who decided     who was a helluva lot more proactive in the mid east peace process than this president ever even dreamt of being     right  until he decided that cheap  blue dresses were a lot more alluring than his credibility as leader of the free world  and not to mention        i am so tired of this puritanical nonsense  the man was a human being  for god's sakes   hello  nora walker  kitty's mom     big fan    of mine   i want you to know your take on immigration is absolutely right   i'd be ashamed to live in a country with a wall  it makes me sick   thank you     mom     what   what the hell are you doing here   he hasn't come into work for three days   where is he now   i don't know   he might be at home  but he's not answering   we should go over   why we  why me   this is your fault   how is this my fault   you're the one who told him to go fight in that stupid war   oh  mom  dad was the one who told him it was the right thing to do   but  kitty  you pushed him   justin is who he is   i didn't convince him to enlist any more than you convinced him to raid your medicine cabinet at age 16     or to   or to get himself kicked out of college for selling 'shrooms in the back of his car   he never wanted to be a soldier   that's what you and your father never understood  he just wanted your approval   you were supposed to say  no   you were supposed to say   we love you too much to let you get hurt like this  no    and now i don't know where my son is   i need you to help me find him  please     ok  let's go    ok  let's go   great shoes   don't ask  what are you guys doing here   we need to talk   so  we're talking serious embezzlement  at ojai foods     yeah    and dad was responsible   saul claims dad made a bad investment  been draining the pension fund to cover it up   i'm not convinced   that doesn't matter  you have to go to the authorities   no  no  no  we need to find out what dad was doing   he must have had a reason   are you not getting it   i get it  i just don't agree   well  you're president now  what do you wanna do   go to hell   tommy  tommy   sarah  trust your gut  do you wanna go down for a crime you inherited   ok  so  if we went to the authorities  what would it look like   it's federal  i have a friend in the u s  attorney's office  we could call him  but there'd be an investigation   you know  bean counters going through trash  subpoenaing the workers  the family     and they'd close us down   we might end up in receivorship  yeah  or forced into bankruptcy   great  sounds great   look  i want you to be prepared  it would be ugly  ok   but the government will go easier if you approach them   that counts   and what about the employees  what about their retirement money  what happens to that   they'd either get very little or nothing   look  it'll be worse if you wait  sarah  you have to come forward   how am i going to tell mom   u s  attorney dan sullivan   please  please  call him   there's no other way  sarah  i'm sorry   ok  thanks   i have a key  i have a key in here somewhere   we don't need a key  mom   good lord in heaven   oh   mom   wake her up   you do it     you do it    you do it    oh  for god's sakes   it's fawn  it's fawn  fawn  fawn  it's ok  it's ok  hi  hi  it's kitty and nora  justin's     how did you guys get in here   the front door was unlocked  where's justin  fawn   at work  right   no  he actually hasn't been showing up  they fired him   those bastards   do you have any idea where justin might be   not really  um  zuma or venice   pineburger   are you covering for him   you can tell us   i swear   mrs   justin  i don't know where he is   oh  all right  my darling  we believe you   but  i really don't think this is very healthy   what's not   medicating  sleeping all day     and you know  you don't look well  i don't think this situation is working out for you  is it   so  let's get ourselves up  get dressed     take your trash and go home    mom   you really don't know where he is   i thought he was at work   i'm not a bad girl   i'm sure you're not  you just need to get up earlier   you know  ok     the truck just broke down out of nowhere     yeah  apparently  and  apparently  it's a real mess   what's wrong   i've got it under control   i'm sure you do  but could i at least know what it is that you're controlling  please   look  one of the rigs broke down in bakersfield  20 tons of peaches     in 115 degrees    so we      look  i said i have it under control  go run your errand     you have that thing to pick up for paige  right    right   excuse me  guys  could i just have a minute   of course   so  is this how it's going to be   you tell me   don't walk away from me again  tommy   what  what are you gonna do  fire me     i'm just trying to get a truck out there so we can salvage what we have    it's just a title   it's more than a title and you know it     you ask most of the guys who runs this company  they'll say me    good   they would've said the same when dad was alive  too   i know  i know   i'm just saying   you wanna be president  just say it   say it  i'll step aside right now   can i do my job   please     sure    thanks     hello    hey  it's noah     remember me  the guy you used to work with    yeah   i just heard about your father  ah  i'm sorry   yeah  well  it's   it's a mess   would you like to grab some coffee   that's a spectacularly bad idea   you're right  i grabbed the wrong file   i meant to grab the file of  reasonably bad ideas    but i grabbed the  spectacularly bad ones  instead   been that kind of day     yeah    come on  just one   this is dumb  hanging out here waiting for him   well  do you really wanna go on a tour of a video arcade or a  2 movie theater   or he could be hiking in griffith park for all we know   i know  i know   we should've put one of those things that they put on dogs so you can track 'em   don't be snippy with me  i'm not on your damn tv show   god  i hate this day   well  i'm not exactly over the moon about it  either   i know what jonathan would do   he would call some friend in washington  and  there'd be some really fancy  expensive detective here with justin in about four hours   well  why don't you call him   you know  you really can tell me the problem with him  i swear i won't judge   the problem     doesn't feel like you and dad   i guess they don't make 'em like that anymore   oh  look   oh  yeah       we've just had too many damn blessings    maybe   hello  yeah  kevin  hi   is he all right   oh  thank god     all right  yeah  come pick us up  we're still at his place    where is he   all right  bye  he's a  he's in jail  ah  in oceanside   he was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct   dad left some serious problems with the company  beyond serious   you think you might have to shut it down   maybe   probably   i can't go into details  i can't even tell joe   you know what they say at business school     almost all family businesses fail in successive generations  i mean       if ojai is already having problems      then we should kick it to the curb  according to our m ba   that's the smart play   it's not that easy   losing ojai'd devastate my family   come on   you have no idea what families can survive   besides  you are not responsible for everything  sarah   you always took on everybody else's problems   you could come back to north light today  you are on the fast track   no  that place was eating up my life   i need to make time for paige and cooper   and joe   then  why do you seem more stressed out now than ever   i mean  at least before  you weren't in it alone   noah   tell me something  how can you feel so guilty     when nothing happened between us   because being in sync with a man who is not your husband  is almost as painful as not being in sync with your husband   don't you ever miss looking forward to something   you know  picking out your shoes  your shirt for somebody   everyday   don't you miss that   sarah  is your hand bleeding   oh god  oh  i suck     what    hawaii   my daughter is hawaii  noah  i'll call  ok   he needs to go into a treatment program again   i agree  even if it's outpatient   you know  a partner of mine just came back from hazleton  minnesota   i'm not sending my son to minnesota  very cold there this time of year   he needs some kind of professional help  mom   i'm not saying he doesn't need help  kevin   i'm just saying now's not the time to theorize about your poor brother  as if he was some sort of case study   what needs to happen is we need to get down to this oceanside place and  get him out of jail  and take him home   why didn't you tell me your father was going to insult him like that   oh  what would you have done if you'd known   i don't know  we could've prepared him   we could've come up with a plan  as it is  you dropped it on him like a bomb   no wonder he's gone off and done something to himself   are you serious   yes  yes  certainly i am   do you ever stop and think that some of this could possibly be your fault   what  what   i was too permissive   no  no  no  no  i'm not talking about the liberal child rearing sense  mom   you blame everybody but yourself  you go out of your way  it's me   it's kevin  it's dad  where were you in the picture  do you ever think about that   i don't see any ocean out there   this is a terrible place to come to   please  please  just one minute  one minute  it's for my little girl   thank you so much  you're so kind   this must happen every night   yeah  it's like  sophie's choice  in here  what do you need   i need a grass hawaiian skirt for a hula   there's miriachis  which would be mexico     coconut cup  closer     ukelele   that's a good sign   sorry   no  don't tell me that  don't tell me that   look  i'm sorry   they're weirdly popular   i can order you one   yeah  yeah  why don't you do that   that'd be great  because then they'll get here  in what    it's the minimum basic requirement that a party store always have hawaii   children have recitals  and their parents  their mothers   can't do it all and we rely on our party store  to keep up their end of the bargain  so that our husbands and our children don't despise us when we come home empty handed   i'll buy the lei   he's really wrecked  usually we like to let this kind dry out for the night in lock up   it reinforces the point  you know   sure  sure   we have driven all the way from los angeles   there's a motel nearby  see you in the a m   bring coffee   all right  thank you  thanks   hi   i'm justin's mother and this is his big sister  kitty   kitty walker   the right idea  and  red  white and blue      you're kidding    no   you're her   yeah  i am   me  yes   i love your show   and we're not asking to be the exception here     yes  we are   no  we're not     yes    no  no     yes  we are    no  we aren't   we are   all the girls came to get me  that's cool  where's sarah     kitty  he's sitting in the back with you    no  seriously  thanks for bringing the whole family  i mean  my day wasn't bad enough   they were worried about you   oh  you had the do the right thing  right   because kevin always does the right thing  except sleep with women   justin  could you shut up for ten seconds   if you didn't want my help  why'd you ask   'cause i was in jail  i figured i should call the family lawyer  i mean  that's what you are  right   if your father could see this behavior   he'd what  judge me  tell me to get a job   he'd be so diappointed   disappointed  who the hell is he to be disappointed  he's the disappointment   what does that mean   forget it   your father loved you more than anything on earth  you little spoiled brat     you know what love means in this family  it means you suck    get in the car   it means nothing you do will be good enough   oh  you ungrateful child   you don't care about anyone but yourself  how did you get that way   you know what losing your father has done to me  and yet you take your life and throw it around like it was worthless   why   'cause i wish i was dead   don't you understand that   i wish i'd died over there  mom   well  you didn't die and i'll be damned if i'll stand around and watch you kill yourself   enough  enough  mom   god  you guys are so freaking serious   hey  sorry     hey  so late  any word from justin    yeah  he got arrested   don't ask  he's fine   you almost missed grilled cheese night   i'm sorry  i've let us all down   they're out of grass skirts  they just sold the last one   these'll be great   today is one of those days where everything you decide really  really  really matters   you    need something aside from grilled cheese   you need someone to say   congratulations    what for   your promotion   how did you know   a little bird on a wire   oh   hawaii  what am i gonna tell her   hand   you need to see something great   what   mom  mommy  mommy  yay   hey  little man     come on  come on  come on    what's going on here   have a seat  my lady   we are ready   i got the last one   she made me teach her this   i hate it when you dominate the remote   i'm curious if gay porn has gotten to oceanside yet   you know  i stay in a lot of hotels   this is research for me   here we go   thirty something inches   only  10 95  shall we   come on  give me that     wait  is that jonathan  it is jonathan    give it to me   he won't let me in  i just want to apologize   why don't you stay here and i'll try and talk to him   thanks   what the hell are we watching   meerkats   these meerkats are wearing no clothes  give me the clicker  now   ok  fine  but no cooking programs   give me the clicker   she was just scared   i'm pretty frightening   he hated me  kitty   is that what you think   i could see it   always the look of somebody who doesn't expect anything from you   until all you do is disappoint him again and again   but he disappointed me  too   he loved you with all of his heart   they have to love you  it's their job   he just didn't know how to show it  to anyone   well  he showed you   and yesterday  he showed me what he thought of me   now he's dead   and i     you know  after you enlisted   he used to call me every day   you know  just to talk   and you know what he used to talk about   justin stories  great ones   he told me that out of all of his children  you were the only one who made him remember what being a kid was   you were the only one who could do that  hmmm   he was so proud of you   c'mon  at age 60  you taught him to surf   he wasn't very good   because of you  he was the only 70 year old who appreciated  death cab     curdle    death cab for cutie   close   well  these are the things he would talk about when he called   i'd ask him how he was  and     these are the things he would say   you know what's nice about road trips   this is a road trip   they have these coffee shops that serve breakfast all night  you want   i want breakfast  all night   you wanted to know when the truck came in   how's it look   i had this little premonition some of it survived the journey       i guess they didn't    gladys  call the insurance   hey  thanks for telling joe   what are you talking about   he bought me champagne last night   champagne was his idea   the back half of the truck is all perfect  we got  like  ten tons of good fruit back there   thanks   i guess some things can be saved  and some can't   tell me  tommy  i need to know  what would you do   i didn't go to business school  all i got is my gut   right now  i trust your gut more than my m ba   sarah  what is it   saul  i love what our family has built here  and i wanna keep it alive   not just for us  but for all the people who work here   people who trusted this family  who trusted this company   i have the number here of a u s  attorney   i'll do it your way  six months  but  at the end of six months  if we haven't found our way out of this  i will call him   ok   i forgot   the pacific     no other ocean has so many colors      and look  you can see where the blues change   black for you  white for you  black and white for you   one's fine   so  which route should we take back  the pretty or the fast   fast   pretty
