fritz   ruby said you called   yeah  i found a slug   never seen one like it before   it was about 30 yards from the body    i'm looking for the casing   i've got the ferg taking some pictures   i  uh  i hear you did the notification   yeah  uh  parkford's  uh  wife didn't even know  that grant was in durant   thought he was in laramie for the weekend   oh  so then this is all about sex   take it easy  vic   when the husband lies about where he's going for the weekend   it's always about sex   so  vic  did you know that branch was running for sheriff   branch connally  you're shitting me   i had no idea   what are you gonna do about it   it's a free country   i'll come by in the morning and pick up that slug   see if omar can help us identify the murder weapon     you expecting an invasion  omar   well  thought i'd get started since i was on walt time   what happened to your hand   hurt it     well  your message said that you found a big slug   so i pulled out all the most popular high caliber rifles   this about that thing in the paper   no comment   ah  the longmire  yes    and if you're here instead of your deputy   you think it's murder    that is a lot of lead    45   70 at least   none of the rifles i've been testing are made for this   any modern rifles you know of that shoot this caliber   no  gotta be something old   odds are  in this part of the country  it's a sharps   called 'em horse killers   take a horse down from 500 yards   pretty valuable antique now   now  this gun's got its drawbacks   it's heavy  makes a hell of a lot of smoke   and with a drop block   it takes about five seconds to reload   appreciate the help  omar   you bet   hey  walt   the sharps is a sniper's weapon   and there are two types of people that like to kill  from a distance    cowards and pros   in my experience  both are dangerous   i'll be all right   vic    vic   vic    vic   vic    you find a casing    no   pants   man  so  how can i help you today  sheriff   i'm looking for a sharps rifle   oh  an original  don't have any right now   but i'll tell you what i do have     this henry  yellow boy  rifle   ahh   it's nice   and this colt peacemaker   both used at little bighorn   bet you got custer's mustache back there  too   yeah   no  i'm mainly interested in the sharps  dan   names of the buyers and sellers   sheriff business   well  i've only seen a few sharps  in the last couple months   charles burnett    he sold me the real deal   but he bought it back a few weeks ago   apparently  charles' grandfather  was not too happy with him selling it without asking   it's sad  though   we get all kinds of people in here  you know     cheyennes  whites  crows  all kinds   just selling off family heirlooms to make ends meet   any other names come to mind   oh  i file all the guns i buy and sell with the atf   so  i'll check my office if you don't mind waiting   i'm very good at waiting     hey  walt  when we expanded the grid  to look for the casing  we found something else     pants   just tell me on the way to the res   okay   talk to branch yet about the knife in your back   just hop in  'cause i want to be there when you do     what the hell happened to your truck       and your hand    you hurt your hand   you're right   you should consider a career in law enforcement   vic  they were a good 75 yards from the victim   the problem is they're wranglers   pretty common pants  pretty common size   just that buckle  let me see that   what  you recognize it  maybe   i can't think of why   here    tommy proud eagle  charles burnett   jefferson stone    all cheyenne  all bought sharps rifles  from dan estes in the last year   that's the gun that killed parkford   in a world where you can buy an ak 47 off the internet   why use an antique like this   might be old  but it still gets the job done   any of these guys connected to grant parkford   don't know   that's why i want to talk to them   and you think the tribal police are gonna help us do that   i like to think if there's a murder involved   they'll put aside petty personal differences  and help us find a killer   they may not think  that you throwing their police chief in prison  is exactly petty   he's the one who decided  to run an extortion racket  not me   what did i tell you    what the hell    vic  stop  that's enough   he did say he'd knock me out the next time he saw me   didn't really keep your word  did you  mathias   what do you want   i want to speak to some people of interest who live on the res   you don't get it   you have no authority here   those are the treaty rules   and i know how important treaties are to you whites   i know you're pissed at me  but this is serious   there's been a murder   i know the kind of rifle used   it's rare  but at least three folks  that live on the res own one   i was hoping just this once  you let me and vic on the res   give me the list  and we'll look into it for you     kind of like a joint task force   but i got to tell you   kind of shorthanded around here   we lost our police chief  chief   how the hell could you just stand there and take that   that son of a bitch better not step off the res   for the last time  just leave it alone   fine   i've tracked down  all the vehicles parked at pronghorn ridge   aside from the victim's s u v  and the barneses' truck   there were two other vehicles     one belonged to a pair of hikers   the other belongs to scott miller   well  aren't you the eager little beaver   scott miller have a license   i thought you might ask that   also  the weather service called back   told me the snow came on pretty sudden  around 3 30  4 00 a m  yesterday   so parkford was probably shot before then   when it was still clear skies and a full moon   i talked to jake hicks from the crazy  j  ranch   he's pissed about the dead sheep   but he says he's never heard of the victim   and speaking of the victim   after you left  i remembered something   parkford came into the station about a month ago   what   our victim came in here and you     you didn't tell me   uh oh   look  i'm sorry i didn't remember the name immediately   it's not like you showed me a picture of the guy   but i did remember it  and i'm telling you now   maybe if we had a more up to date computer syst    why  branch  why did the victim come into my station   some friend of his  a woman named may stillwater   was looking for her missing daughter   parkford was helping out   he brought a photo of the missing girl   her name's lilly    and what did you do   everything i could   parkford wasn't a relative   couldn't file a missing persons claim   and he said the girl was from the res   by law  that makes it a tribal police problem   so i forwarded the info on to them   i could've called the feds   but i know you don't like it when they get involved   why didn't you tell me any of this at the time   well  you haven't exactly been on top of your game  for the last year   vic  the ferg  and i have been trying to handle everything   but it's not easy   well  sorry i haven't been here to hold your hand   it's called delegating   that's part of the sheriff's job  branch   speaking of which   is there anything else you forgot to tell me   anything you think i should know   anything   no   no   so  where you going now   to do what you should have done     talk to this girl's mom  and find out what the hell grant parkford  was doing in this county   i know your memory is slipping   but didn't the tribal police basically just tell you  to stay the hell off the reservation   well  i never said it was gonna be easy     hey  henry   i need a favor   and i need a wingman   gina here does not want to leave her sister   and i was just saying how my best friend  is single  employed  and almost as charming as me   how 'bout it  dinner in town   or should we just eat here at the red pony   will you ladies excuse us   you got to get back on the horse  walt   i appreciate the advice   but that's not what i'm here for       may  standing bear  i thought you were coming alone   henry  hello  may   those dogs have a sixth sense   they smell white people   who's in the truck     he wants to help   may  well  what the hell took you so long   she's been missing three months   i'm here now  and i do want to help   do you have any idea where she may have gone   well  if i knew that   i would've gone after her  wouldn't i   have you heard from her since then    once   we had a big fight  and she left   so she was staying with some older girl  who left the reservation   what do you know about the girl she was staying with   not much  they say she's a prostitute   my boyfriend   he says that he thinks that lilly's into that  too   but i don't believe it   she's only 16   is this a recent photo   where did you get that   it was given to one of my deputies  a couple weeks ago  by a man who said he was helping you look for lilly   oh  my god   grant came to see you   i didn't realize he was doing anything   h he never called me back   but you do know mr  parkford   yes  of course  he's lilly's father    he didn't tell you that   no  ma'am   well  i guess he wouldn't   he asked me to stop calling him after he got married   did you   yes    until last month   i was so desperate  nobody would help   so i called grant   and he said he was sorry he couldn't do anything   but i knew he would help     grant's a good man   henry  may  you said you have a boyfriend   he have any idea where lilly may have gone   charles and lilly don't get along   that wouldn't happen to be charles burnett  would it   yes   ms  stillwater  we'll do all we can to find your girl   thank you   and tell grant    tell him thank you  too   i will   we pretty much swept the hookers out of absaroka last year   you heard of anything new about prostitution  in the county or on the res   not my thing  never had to pay for it   have i lost a step   what   i just had to ask you  about the state of the sex trade in my own county   you are an optimist   you don't like to think of the depravity of humankind   and also  yes  you have lost a step   hardly an optimist   it's not an hour ago  i thought grant parkford  was just some guy having an affair   never occurred to me he was doing something heroic   heroic   trying to save his daughter from prostitution  seems honorable  maybe   but just because a man  decides to make up for all his mistakes in one day  does not mean the rest of the world  is going to be so quick to forgive him     hey  punk  hey   you scared me  sorry  i let myself in   i made some coffee    what are you doing here  cady   you canceled on lunch and dinner   and i'm just seeing if everything's okay   hey  i never canceled dinner  we never planned that   oh  okay   now  how 'bout i make us some pancakes   no  i got to be in court   what happened to your hand   i hurt it   this job    you have got to be more careful   well  you may not have to worry about that much longer   branch connally's decided to run against me   so i might be out of a job soon enough   where did you get that   from inside   it's amazing that i found anything in there     the place is even more of a mess than last time   i was looking for coffee  and i found that   you've got mom's ashes in the kitchen   i'm worried about you  dad   i think you might need some help  i don't need any help   the house is a disaster area   i'm fixing it up  i'm remodeling   with beer cans   well  if we're not gonna have any breakfast   i have some work to do  i heard about the accident   and i heard that you had empties all over your truck   i wasn't drinking   i really think you need to talk to someone   i talk to people all day long  cady   what i could really use is a break from all the talking   you need to deal with this   people are asking me where they can visit mom   scatter her ashes   put them in an urn at a mausoleum   put her name on a freaking bench  but deal with it   because i'm not gonna watch you just wallow in this  for another year   you're gonna be late for court   okay     morning  dan  walt   i went back five years in my records  and found some more sharps rifles buyers and sellers   thanks     is there something else   yeah    these sconces   consider selling 'em  they're not mine to sell   i'll give you  800 for 'em    a lot more for the bookcases   how'd you end up with such amazing pieces  in a sheriff's station   long time ago  this place used to be a library  so     vic  give me those pants   if i had a dime for every time a man said that to me     i remember why  the belt buckle on the pants looks so familiar     it's from the old  never heard of it   that's 'cause it's called the driggs ranch now   used to be 10 point  garrett  i told the sheriff  you all would cooperate  so i expect you will   we found something out at pronghorn ridge trailhead   and we want to return them to their owner   anyone recognize these   no   okay   take off your pants     hello  cinderella   colton  they're wranglers   they could belong to anybody in the state   not wearing this belt   colton  that is the buckle  i gave to you on your 21st birthday   what the hell is going on    i was out there trying to get laid   who were you there with  nobody   i mean  i went out there alone   just you and a herd of soft  compliant sheep   what  no  no   my boys dared me to go out there 'cause that's where the     the girls that you pay to     you mean hookers   colton  there aren't any prostitutes  anywhere near pronghorn ridge   well  not now  they moved the rv   the rv  yeah   they move around so folks like you can't find 'em   hey   you were with a prostitute in an rv   yeah  but we didn't do anything  all right   i mean  we started    started to kind of get into it  and this     this big guy walked in  and i i was like     i was like   whoa  hang on  dude    but then    but then he threw me out  without my damn pants on   can you describe the big guy   big   i didn't get a good look at him   what about the girl     told you  my friends wanted proof that     they dared me to go out there     you say they  um     they move this rv around  so folks like me can't find it   how do folks like you go about finding it   i don't know   the girl in this photo   the one you paid to have sex with     she's 16 years old   now  that's statutory rape in the state of wyoming   yeah  but i never had sex with her     you answer the damn question   if you want to know where the rv's at   go talk to the indian at the red pony   what the hell have you gotten yourself into  henry   henry  jukebox is broke  it only plays country   that's not what i'm asking about   well  then i guess you better tell me  what you are asking about  so i can give you a better answer   are you running some kind of escort service out of this bar   well   i'm only gonna wait so long for you to crack a smile  walt   then i'm gonna have to assume that you're not kidding   i asked you a very simple question   no  you asked me a very confusing question   really   'cause i was just talking to a young man  who gave me some inside info   said if you're looking  for female company in absaroka county  and you were willing to pay for the pleasure   you should go to the red pony and talk to the indian   so   38 years  then   we have known each other for 37 years   so 38 years must be how long you have to be  walt longmire's friend before he trusts you   i'm trying to find the person that murdered grant parkford   and i'm pretty sure whoever that is  will lead me to that missing girl   well  you better get going  then     i managed to get my hands on charles burnett's gun  by talking to the tribal police   they were happy to help   i served a search warrant  got the rifle   plus a box of old black powder shells   this is not the murder weapon    how can you tell   we didn't even get a chance to run the ballistics tests     there   we just did a ballistics test   if you don't clean these rifles that use black powder shells   the black powder corrodes the metal   this weapon's a mess   unlock him  ferg   see him to the door   you didn't have to do that   you didn't have to make a big deal out of it  in front of everybody   you know  walt  i haven't made a big deal  over you not showing up for work  calling in sick   or just sitting in here reading a book  while the rest of us cover for you   sounds like you're already writing  negative campaign ads   i saw the sign  branch  nice photo   they weren't supposed to go up till i talked to you   you really think you're the man for this job  branch   i'll leave that up to the people   but given a choice between some fresh thinking  and a tired  absentee sheriff  driving around with empty beer cans  all over the floor of his truck   i like my odds   i heard about your little accident   i'm sorry i embarrassed you back there  branch   but before you start spreading any accusations   consider this   every man that's ever had a beer with me  will tell you the same thing   i drink rainier   always have  always will   those beer cans   they weren't rainier  none of 'em   i picked 'em up 'cause i hate looking at litter   everyone knows that  too    hound of the baskervilles   sherlock holmes   if you're gonna be sheriff   you need to start brushing up on your detective work  son    ruby  sheriff   susan parkford   of course   susan  am i interrupting   no  no  no  i'm sorry  you told me to     official i d   i just want to see the body   of course   i i  uh  i also need to apologize   for what   the other day  um     i also know what it's like to lose someone   this is the one year anniversary  of my own wife's passing   the day i visited you   i tried to put that out of my mind   and you opened the door   i smelled perfume   jo malone   that's what my wife wore   and i only hope i didn't make the situation worse   was he having an affair   i can handle it   i mean  knowing is better than not knowing  so  please   your husband wasn't having an affair   but i discovered something else   long before he married you or even met you   your husband had a daughter   now  she's gone missing   and grant was trying to help find her   grant had a daughter     your husband was just a man   we're all idiots   we make mistakes   and we don't like people knowing about our mistakes   but grant was one of the good ones   he was trying to make things right   and he was trying to do it without hurting you   mrs  parkford  i swear   i'm gonna find out who did this to your husband    does it ever stop hurting   not really     i guess the only way it could ever stop hurting     if we could forget about 'em   and that's the thing  'cause     i don't want to forget anything     bob  okay  present  present  okay     hey  bob  a couple questions  i forgot to ask you the other day   i don't like to forget anything   i don't know if this is really a good time   come on in      so    so  bob   you and your son weren't really hunting the other day   were you     i know about the mobile brothel  that was parked out there   what are you     bob  there's no crime against being an idiot   but lying about it    that can be a problem   okay   well  we really intended to go hunting   and    and then we saw the rv and changed our plan   we  uh  came back into town and hit the atm   then we    we headed back out there  to spend a little time with the ladies   how did you know  just from looking at the rv  it was a brothel   oh  man  we know that rv   the old one with the red white and blue stripe on the side   when it ain't out working  it's parked here   who owns it   i don't know   ah   a ch   a cheyenne kid   his name's avo   any idea where i might find him   he's usually working   he's a busboy over at the red pony like that       wow   a roadblock   this seems like overkill   you could have just called to apologize   hello  henry   i have a name for you  plus three other matters   is  avo  the name   the other indian at the red pony   avo's the owner of the rv  these girls have been working out of   what are the three other things   first   while i could not find avo myself   we spoke through a cousin   avo will meet you tomorrow morning  11 00 am   there is an old  empty cabin  about three miles off the highway  near the south entrance of the res   second    i do not think you should go   it sounds like a setup   and there's already one dead white guy   what's the third thing   since you will

let's talk   the dead guy    i met him a couple times   he came into the red pony   said he was looking to get laid   everybody knows if you want to get laid   you talk to the indian at the red pony   what did you do   i sent him to the girls  that was a mistake   i heard later he was freaking out  when he got to the rv   yelling and waving a gun around   so when he came back the other day  i said   no way  man    he came back after causing a scene like that   he apologized and said he was upset the first time  'cause what he was really looking for was an indian girl   guess that's his thing   he wanted to poke a pocahontas   anyway  i didn't want a problem with that crazy guy   so i told him where to go   but i called it in right away   i told them   better move the rv    i didn't know he was gonna kill him   i swear   who is  he    avo  whoever  he  is  is trying to frame you   now  the only way i can protect you  is if you tell me who you're working for   understand    i don't know
