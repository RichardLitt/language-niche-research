 where does it come from   this quest  this need to solve life's mysteries  when the simplest of questions can never be answered   why are we are   what is the soul   why do we dream   perhaps we'd be better off not looking at all   not dwelving  not yearning   that's not human nature   not the human heart   that is not why we are here   how is he doing   i'm sorry  did i scare you   no   no  i just    i keep having these amazing dreams  everytime i close my eyes and     nevermind   he likes me reading the stock page   is he even conscious at all   no   it's been a week now   i think he's close   a couple more days maybe   you know i don't know what he'd do without you   you have a real gift   just doing my job   no   you're like a son to him   yeah  well  that would make us like brother and sister   it'd be a little ankward if i ever wanted to ask out   i'm sorry  that was    that was inappropriate   no  it's sweet  it's       i'm dating somebody and i      yeah  no  really  it's okay   i need to change his iv   i'm sorry   man is a narcissistic species by nature   we have colonized the 4 corners of our tiny planet   but we are not the pinacle of so called evolution   that honor belongs to the lowly cockroach   capable of living for months without food   remaining alive headless for weeks at a time   resistant to radiation   if god has indeed created himself in his own image   then i submit to you that god is a cockroach   they say that man uses only a 10th of his brain power   another percent and we might actually be worthy of god's image   unless of course that day has already arrived   the human genome project has discovered that  tiny variations in man's genetic code  are taking place at increasingly rapid rates   teleportation  levitation  tissue regeneration   is this outside the realm of possibility   or is man entering a new gateway to evolution   is he finally standing at the threshold of true human potential   i'm sorry  i'm out of time   i know  i know  i'm beginning to sound like my father  i can't help it   you know they can fire me too if they like   but there is something to it  merad   as crazy as it sounds       what is it    it's your father  he's dead   how   driving a taxi in new york city is a very dangerous job   the wrong fare  the wrong time  we may never know what really happened   you know i spoke to him 2 days ago   he was convincing someone was following him  trying to steal his research   he died because of his thesis     that's crazy    is it   the man left his family   discredited his career to chase wild theories halfway around the world   where are you going   to his apartment  to get his papers and research   he was this close to finding the first of them   his patient zero  he tracked him to queens  new york   mohinder  listen to me   your father was my colleague and my friend   a respected professor  a brilliant geneticist  but he had clearly lost touch with reality   i followed in his footsteps  my thesis is based on his research   yes  you always wanted his approval   and now you're telling that it was all for nothing   i'm telling you     to let go   i need to know why he died   i need to know that it wasn't all for nothing   and then i need to finish what he started   hello   yeah  yeah  i'm in his place now   no  no  no  he left everything behind but his computer   research  the map   yeah  let's get a team in here to bag and tag everything   i gotta call you right back   pervert   time to get up  mika   mika   mika   mika     mika    what   damn  mika  don't do that to

the right fit for him     but he's made friends    i'm sorry     he's on the soccer team    i'm sorry   i wrote a check for  25 000 to get him into this snob fest   i was told that's what it took   that's on top of the tuition   about the tuition  your last 3 checks have bounced   fine  take it out of the  that was a donation and it was very appreciated   well  i want my money back   i want my money back now   that money went to capital campaign for the new wing     it's already been spent    then unspend it   i'm sorry   we can maybe discuss an extension of the money you owe but i     i want my money back   that's not possible   come on  baby  let's get out of here   you're too good for this lousy school   mom   leave me alone   for god's sakes  ma   are you okay   they  dropped the

you make   maybe i'll shoplift my socks   don't get smart   when you put everyone else first  you end up last   you always put nathan first  he took advantage   it wasn't you that was just pushing him right out in front of me   he takes up more space than you   demanded more attention   and besides it's not my fault  you allowed it   he's my brother  i love him   love is overrrated   he loves me too   you know it   you've always been close   croseolorlasses   that's cruel  mom   since dad died i know you've been feeling free to speak your mind  but it wouldn't hurt to edit yourself every once in a while   i'm sorry if the truth hurts   i'm just saying you hero worships him   and those feelings will never return   you're wrong   it's biological  i can't help it  we're    we're connected   i never told you this  but when nathan had his accident   i knew it   we all got the same call   no  i'm saying before the call   like he was telling me   i woke up and i knew that he'd been hurt   i
