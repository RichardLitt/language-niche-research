so i had a little chat  with principal figgins  and he said that if you're group  doesn't place at regionals  he's cutting the program    ouch   you know  you don't have to worry about glee club   we're going to be fine   really   'cause i was at the local library   where i read cheerleading today aloud  to blind geriatrics   and i came across this little page turner   show choir rule book   and it turns out   you need 12 kids to qualify for regionals   last time i looked   you only had five and a half   here  cripple in the wheelchair   i also took the liberty of highlighting some special ed classes  for you   maybe you could find some recruits    because i'm not sure there's anybody else  who's going to want to swim over  to your island of misfit toys   are you threatening me   sue  threatening you   oh  no  no  no   presenting you with an opportunity  to compromise yourself   you betcha   let's break it down   you want to be creative   you want to be in the spotlight   face it  you want to be me   so  here's the deal   you do with your depressing little group of kids  what i did with my wealthy  elderly mother   euthanize it   it's time   and then i'll be happy to offer you a job  as my second assistant on cheerios   you can fetch me gatorade  and launder my soiled delicates   it'll be very rewarding  work for you   you know what  sue   i politely decline your offer   glee club is here to stay   i believe in my kids   i know you're used to being the cock of the walk around here     offensive      but it looks like your cheerios  are going to have some competition   we're going to show at regionals   you have my word on that   have a good day     quinn  we are in line to be the most popular kids in this school  over the next couple of years  yeah  i know   prom king and queen  homecoming court royalty   i'm not giving up those shiny crowns  just so you can  express yourself    finn  look  you're making too big a deal out of this   okay  let's compromise   if you quit the club   i'll let you touch my breast   finn  under the shirt   over the bra   no  no   i can't   i want to do glee  i    i'm really happy when i'm performing   people think

talk  man hands   you can dance with him  you can sing with him   but you will never have him   i understand why you'd be threatened   finn and i have made a connection   but i'm an honorable person   i don't need to steal your man   i have plenty of suitors of my own   every day glee's status is going up  and yours is going down     deal with it     holla     ah  freak out      le freak  c'est

into it   no  it's the song   it's really gay  we need  modern music  mr  shue   i'm sorry  guys   we don't have time to discuss this   we're doing the song this friday at the pep assembly   in f front of the whole school   exactly   they're gonna throw fruit at us   and i just had a facial   i'll press charges if that happens   guys  i can't express to you  how important this assembly is   we need recruits   there're six of you   we need 12 to qualify for regionals   we have no choice or     the club is over   i know you guys don't like this song   but we took nationals back in '93 with  freak out    it's a crowd pleaser   trust me   from the top   i'm dead   captioning sponsored by  will  my father always said you become a man  when you buy your first house   i'm not sure what he meant by that   since he burned ours down once after a drunken fight with mom   welcome to your little slice of the american dream   i have a question about the trees   it's always been my personal dream  to cut down my own christmas tree   how many christmas trees will we have in the backyard   and do they come in different colors   because  well   obviously  we're expecting a family   and i have a real sense that it might be a girl   will  still  i can't believe we're actually doing this   it all happened so fast       it all started when terri's sister kendra  brought her kids over for sunday brunch   well  i just don't understand  where you're planning on putting the nursery   i know   we have a second bedroom   you are not giving up your craft room  terri   a mother needs her respite   that craft room is the only thing  that's going to keep you from going all susan smith  on that little angel   postpartum runs in our family   where are you going   bathroom   all that bran   no  you can't   kyle needs his inhaler       anyway  this conversation is over   they're starting construction  on a new section of our subdivision   you are not  bringing my niece or nephew home to this apartment   when pigs fly     can i eat this   this banister was made by ecuadorian children    it's great  terri   but there are nine foreclosures on our street   why can't we buy one of those   they're half the price  i am not raising our baby  in a used house  they're not clean   oh   look at this sun nook   isn't it beautiful   is i iextra  mm   the price in the brochure is for the basic model    everything else is  la carte   the grand foyer is an extra  14 000   and the sun nook is an extra 24   i'll let you two talk   thank you  thank you     we can't afford this   we already did the math  will   all we have to do is give up applebee's   and we won't run the ac for the first couple of summers   well  we certainly can't afford the grand foyer   and the sun nook   i mean  if we bite off more than we can chew  we'll lose everything   you need to pick one   come with me   i'm going to show you something really special   this is where our daughter or gay son will sleep   i thought maybe we could put one  of those mini pianos in here   and you two could put on shows for me   i love it  terri   but we still can't afford everything     it's my very own sophie's choice   fine   i'm going to give up the sun nook for the grand foyer   but i really need the polished door handles   think of our family  will   this is our dream   will  i knew in that moment that i would do whatever it took   even if it meant getting a part time job  to make some extra money   to make that dream come true   let's go sign those papers   yes   you need to call me before you dress yourself  whatever  whatever   you look like a technicolor zebra  you're a hater   and i look like i'm a partier  that's what you are  a hater   you're trying to copy me  it looks like i planned it   you know what  if you're hair was longer  you'd have curls  will  all right  guys   how about a little kanye     for the assembly   no  we won't be ready in time   we're still doing disco   but we can fold this into our repertoire   and it'll be awesome at regionals   communication is the foundation  of any successful music group   if we're going to succeed we need to communicate   you guys said you wanted modern music  i listened   mr  shue  we'd really like to not do disco at that assembly   finn  you're going to take the solo   what  no  i i can't do the solo  mr  shue   i'm still learning     learning how to walk and sing at the same time   no problem   i'll walk you through it   all  ooh   challenge   mercedes  you know this   oh  i got this     she take my money      when i'm in need

pre nup  yeah       that was fun   all right  just like that  ready         rachel  did you just throw up   no   you missed the toilet   the girl who was throwing up before me left that   i tried  but i guess i just don't have a gag reflex   one day when you're older   that'll turn out to be a gift   let's have a little chat  okay      rachel  bulimia is a very  messy  serious disease   i don't have bulimia   i tried it and failed  and won't ever attempt it again   okay   it grossed me out   okay  but i still want to talk  about the feelings that you had  that led up to you wanting to puke your guts out   i want to be thinner   and prettier like that quinn girl   mm hmm  and  um  why is that   have you ever liked somebody so much   you just want to lock yourself in your room   turn on sad music and cry   no       all by my         by myself   i'm by myself     don't want to be       uh  but a boy crush  huh   i know about that  i mean  not now   it takes me back in the day   like  a long time ago i knew about that   you know what  you need to remember  rachel   to protect your heart   i don't care who he is   if he doesn't like you for the way you are   or if he's    you know  he's married  with a baby on the way   that's not worth the heartache   you don't want to compromise    yourself    for that   um      have you just tried  telling him how you feel   he doesn't even notice me   i see   um  okay  well  here's what i think   common interests are the key to romance   all ght  so find out what he likes   then he'll see you in a positive way  and  maybe you'll end up doing something  sue  would you like  to tell principal figgins and mr  schuester  what i caught you two doing   it just sort of happened   i don't mean to be rude   but i think she's overreacting   you watch your tone  young lady   gay parents encourage rebellion   there are studies on this   whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa   all right  tell me what happened  rachel   finn was worried about having to perform a solo  at the pep assembly in front of his chromosomally challenged  friends   i was immediately concerned  by his lack of self esteem  and made a creative preemptive strike   yeah  pretty much what she said   you know  one of the amazing things  about being in the performing arts is that  you can parlay it into so many different fields   like justin timberlake   he's a singer  but he also has a clothing line   and you know  he makes things like shirts and belts   who is justin timberlake   rachel  it was a two fold plan   we figured that with the right marketing strategy   we could pull from the entire student body  without having an assembly   thus creating the diverse glee club  this school has been craving   that copy machine is for cheerios use only   paid for by alumni donations   i can't begin to fathom the damage  you'd have done to the program had you broken it   hold on a second  sue   i resent being told  to hold on to anything  william   i will not be treated  like a second class citizen because of my gender   there is a very clear bureaucracy  when it comes to photocopies  and you seem to think  that these procedures don't apply to your students   it is my strong recommendation  that both these students be hobbled   how many copies did you guys make    okay  and how much does a photocopy cost   four and a half cents   how about they just pay for the copies   i like this compromise   children  pay ms  sylvester   and we'll let you off with a warning   and sue  i'm sorry  but i'll have to ask you  to personally clean the congealed  protein shake off the photocopy room floor   that's why we have janitors   sue  we're in a recession  and concessions must be made   i've laid off half the janitorial staff   we all need to lend a hand   lady justice wept today   i'm sorry about that  mr  shue   i'd like to get the flyers up before lunch tomorrow   you know what  guys  i don't want to hear it   doing that song is going to kill any chance the glee club has   it's a terrible idea   i have news for you  rachel   sometimes you have to do things you don't want to do   we're doing the assembly   and you're not putting up those flyers   everybody loves disco   it's official   i'm a dead man   look  i know you're nervous   but you're really  really talented   stop it   i mean  maybe it'll all be okay   do you want to practice  for the assembly tomorrow after school   i can't  i got a celibacy club meeting   baby  i have some bad news   a wealthy relative died   i don't have any wealthy relatives   oh   i've just been pounding the pavement  all week after glee rehearsal   i    i can't find any extra work   that probably means no grand foyer   why can't we ever be the ones to catch a break   no  no  it's going to be okay  baby   i mean  we don't need a grand foyer to be happy     no  you know what  i'm so tired of the compromising   i want my grand foyer  i want my dream house   i work hard  i sacrifice   i deserve it   you know  we give and we give   do you think that the big shots  at sheets n' things care  that i sell more personal massagers  than any other assistant manager   no  or do you think that those kids    that they give a damn that we go with so little  because you spend all your spare time  choreographing those stupid dance routines   i mean  when  does anyone start giving back       i thought you asked sue to clean up after herself   sue got a note from the school nurse claiming  that her lupus made it impossible  to bend over a bucket of suds   i've been here till 10 00 p m  every night  up to my elbows in vamoose   any problem with me taking over  one of those nighttime janitorial slots   i'll work at half salary   the celibacy club is now in session   thanks to a school rule  that says we have to let anyone join the club   we're welcoming a new member this week   rachel whatshername   where are all the boys   down the hall   first half hour  we separate   then we come together to share our faith   finn  i'm still on the fence about the celibacy club   i mean  i only joined to get into quinn fabray's pants   still  it is a productive way for us guys to get together  and talk about sexual issues   i think i'm going to kill myself   i'm serious   we're bombarded with sexual imagery every day   beer ads  those short skirts   i'm supposed to be surrounded by temptation   not be able to do anything about it   are you kidding   those skirts are crunchy toast   santana lopez bent over in hers the other day   and i swear i could see her ovaries   god bless the perv that invented these   remember the power motto  girls   all  it's all about the teasing and not about the pleasing   oh  back it up like a dump truck   baby   so  how far does quinn let you get anyway   we grind  make out   but how do you keep from    arriving early   whenever i grind  cinco de mayo     it's not a problem for me  man   actually  it's a big problem   somebody once told me  that to keep from erupting too early   you should think of dead kittens and stuff   but the only image that works for me happened  the day my mom took me out  to practice for my driver's permit   pretty good  honey   who says a father figure's necessary  huh     driving's fun  yeah      oh  my god   oh  my  oh  my  oh  my god  you killed him   what are you gonna do   let's pair up for the immaculate affection   now  remember  if the balloon pops   the noise makes the angels cry       you enchant me   boy  yeah   stop it  take it   ah  yeah  oh   finn   it must have hit my zipper   you know what  this is a joke   did you know  that most studies have demonstrated  that celibacy doesn't work in high schools   our hormones  are driving us too crazy to abstain   the second we start telling ourselves  that there's no room for compromise  we act out   the only way to deal with teen sexuality  is to be prepared   that's what contraception is for   don't you dare mention the  c  word   you want to know a dirty little secret  that none of them want you to know   girls want sex just as much as guys do   is is that accurate     will   aah    aah   emma    what are you doing here so late   i do sat prep on tuesday nights   are you  um  are you a janitor   a ja   no   really   'cause you're dressed like a janitor  and your shirt says  will    um    terri and i are trying to buy a house   and we're  you know  struggling to make ends meet  and       i'm really embarrassed   would you mind keeping this between us   yeah   oh  yeah  your secret's completely safe with me   thank you   do you  um     do you want a hand   oh  no   i i'm good  really   really  because  um  i can see from here  that you've used window cleaner to mop the floor   and  uh  that keyboard is crawling in e coli   because i know for a fact ms  hoffmeyer  doesn't wash her hands after doing number twos   i really admire you working so hard for something you want   let's make a deal   you're helping me with my problem   how about i take a stab at one of yours   oh  no  i don't   i don't have a problem   you've been scrubbing that pencil sharpener for an hour   well  i mean  i have   i have a little trouble with messes   but it's not like it's a    problem   okay   when i was a little girl   it was my dream to work on a dairy farm   really   um  when i was eight   we finally visited one  and after the tour  and the yogurt tasting  my  my brother  pushed me into the runoff lagoon   what   and  um  ever since then i've just     i've had a little trouble  forgetting the  uh  the smell   have you thought about  i don't know   maybe seeing someone about that   oh  no  it's completely manageable   you know  i just try to take lots of showers  and i  um  you know  i don't eat dairy   so     i want to try        a little experiment   oh  no  no  i'm not really  um  comfortable  with  with    that   there   ten seconds   new record   it's late  i should  um     i should be  um    going    i officially  call this meeting of glee club in session   but mr  schuester isn't here  mr  schuester isn't coming   i paid a freshman to ask him for help  with irregular verbs    i'm so sick of hearing you squawk  eva peron   let her talk   i have another idea for the assembly   can i  once again  stress my most strenuous  objections to this attempted suicide   they're not going to kill us   because we're going to give them what they want   blood  better   sex     silence  children   silence   first  an announcement   the toilets are broken again   we are fixing the problem  but let me warn you   there will be zero tolerance  for anyone soiling school grounds   we're not going to have a repeat of last time   we have a treat for you guys today   mr  schuester   yay  glee   glee kids  hooray   hi  uh  when i went to school here   glee club ruled this place   and we're on our way back   but we need some recruits to join the party   now  i could tell you all about  how great glee is  but  uh

that was the most offensive thing i've seen  in 20 years of teaching   and that includes an elementary school production of hair   we received angry e mails  from a number of concerned parents   many of whom thought that their children were going to hear  a special olympian speak about overcoming adversity   i    i really don't know what to say   well  let me help you out  then   my first thought  was that your students should be  put into foster care     but you're the one who should be punished   i demand your resignation from this school   as well as the disbanding of glee club   now  hold on  sue   the issue is content   those kids are talented   and i have not seen the student body this excited  since tiffany performed at the north hills mall   i took the liberty of calling my pastor  to provide a list of family friendly songs  that reflect our community's values   your kids can only perform these preapproved musical selections   but all these songs have either   jesus  or

asthma   what are you doing   chasing a married guy   i saw you playing house  with him after hours  emma   look   i don't know a lot about relationships   most of mine are short and flame out once

wondering why you asked me to help you with your singing   you kicked butt at the assembly   well  this is     my only chance to be   you know  good like you   you think i'm good   well  when i first joined  i thought you were kind of insane   i mean  you talk a lot more than you should  and to be honest  with you  i looked under the bed  and made sure that you weren't  hanging out under there   but then  i heard you sing   i don't know how to say this   but you touched something in me   right here   your heart's on the other  side of your chest   oh   it's beating really hard   you're cool

badly that your body mimics the symptoms   if you're meant to get pregnant  it'll happen   i have to say  i'm a little surprised you guys are trying in on it   i'm sure you've read about this in the school paper   finn and i have been an item for a while now   so what kind of girlfriend would i be if i didn't support him   well  let's see what you've got       say a little prayer for you      the
