   1   when i was a little girl   my understanding of revenge  was as simple as the sunday school proverbs  it hid behind   neat little morality slogans   like  do unto others   and  two wrongs don't make a right           if you love me        but two wrongs can never make a right  because two wrongs can never equal each other                  for the truly wronged     real satisfaction can only be found  in one of two places     absolute forgiveness     or mortal vindication        this is not a story about forgiveness    emily        i've been looking for you  where's daniel   uh  he's walking the beach  we're having a thing   same thing or different thing   same thing  but don't worry  he's right behind me   it's my job to worry  your job is to enjoy yourself   it's your engagement party   can someone get me a 20 on daniel grayson   hey  congrats  emily   thank you          nice night for it   nice night for what  nolan   celebrating   you shouldn't be here   that makes two of

fire and ice     when we first sat down to discuss tonight's occasion   i was immediately taken with the idea  of an evening inspired by primal bookends     fire and ice     beginnings and endings     and the love between a man and a woman             yo  yo  8 mile   private party here          a starry evening    that creep better not be taking pictures     hey    you got a problem       tonight not only marks the final weekend  of a remarkable summer in the hamptons   it is also the celebration  of my son daniel's engagement      to the lovely and beguiling  ms  emily thorne       and though we've only known her  for a few short months   emily already feels like the piece of the family puzzle  we never even knew was missing    aw   in a word   i approve    and as anyone can tell you   approval is not something i give away freely     where the hell is my son     charlotte   oh  my god     mom   mom   my brother    somebody come here      come here   mom   daniel    daniel   daniel

loyal hamptonites for years   perhaps if mr  davis had been a bit more loyal to his wife   they wouldn't be renting out this season   word has it  he dumped her  for a girl half his age    men   you

with the new  memorial day party  has been overwhelming  mrs  grayson   the party is at 90  capacity       and the  regrets  web site's  already collected nearly  50 000   for everything from domestic violence prevention  to cancer awareness   some of these regrets  wouldn't wipe their noses with  50 000  dear     if we're going to set a more generous tone for the summer   it's clear i'm going to have to do something fresh  and provocative  so     i've decided to auction off a piece  from my personal art collection   what a wild idea  victoria   well  i don't care how good the cause is   if you put up the van gogh that michael and i gave you      i'll kill myself   the van gogh is off limits for sentimental reasons   please   okay   ashley  would you please add the new announcement  to the web site  see if we can't drum up some more business   and  ladies  thanks again    lydia     we were all so sorry  to hear about you and michael this winter   you were one of those couples everyone roots for   i have no doubt     how are you holding up   michael's threatening to put the beach house on the market  if i don't release my claim on the west side walk up   it's bad enough  having some stranger renting it out   i can't bear the thought of losing it  to one of the she wolves   mm  well  then don't let them see your weakness   it's the first thing they'll use against you     all right   mm hmm  thank you                 and i'm waiting for the day          i know you've got your part            and i'm waiting for the day      hey  you want to know a trick  yeah   you

memorial day         i wanted the theme of today's party  to signify a fresh start for all of us   as difficult as the last few years have been   they have been devastating on our charities   but now  as things are beginning to turn around   i'm looking forward to giving back   and i know that all of you are  too     so to start things off right   i'd like to announce the winner of the art auction   my dear friend     lydia davis      oh    congratulations   who won't be going home with the manet this evening   but with the treasured van gogh that hangs in my living room     but i thought the

officially on the market  ms  davis      i'm afraid this will be  her final weekend in the hamptons     so call your realtors  ladies and gentlemen   because this one's going to go fast   and  lydia     wherever you end up   i hope that the van gogh is a constant reminder  of the friendship we shared         get your hands off my daughter     i want that kid outta here  now   give her to social

physically incapable of taking responsibility  for your actions   there is a problem we seem to share   if you'll remember  i gave up everything once  to prove how much i love you   i returned the favor  i helped you destroy a man   oh  no  no  no  that was your idea  not mine   you did what you did to save yourself as much as me   a compromise i'm reminded of every day   you got plenty in the bargain   oh        these guys really put the  suck  in seersucker   want to bump it up a notch   what a waste of humanity   oh  my god     i'm so sorry   god  i'm such an idiot   no  don't worry
