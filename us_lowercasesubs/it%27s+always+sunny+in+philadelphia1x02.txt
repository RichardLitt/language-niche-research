use birth control     oh  dee  we went to catholic school  so      okay  you're allowed     to have premarital sex  but you're not allowed to use birth control   no  all right  you're twisting words here and  like  gettin' cute   when did she have this kid     it's been  like  10 years since i've even seen her  so      ten years     what does she want    well  that's    that's the weird thing
