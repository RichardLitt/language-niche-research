to snap     uh  good morning   many of you are halfway through  your first week here at greendale  and as your dean  i thought i would  share a few thoughts of wisdom and inspiration   what is community college   well  you've heard all kinds of things   you've heard it's  loser college  for remedial teens   middle age divorcees   and old people keeping their minds active  as they circle the drain of eternity    that's what you heard   however  i wish you luck   okay  you know   uh oh   okay  there's more to this speech   there's actually a middle card that is missing   can we all look around our immediate areas   'cause i really wanted to      i'm only half arabic  actually   my dad is palestinian  he's a u s  citizen   he's not a threat to national security or anything   a lot of people want to know that after they meet him   because he has an angry energy   but not  like  angry at america   just angry at my mom for leaving him   although she did leave because he was angry  and he was angry because she's american   my name's abed  by the way     abed  nice to know you and then meet you in that order   now about that question that i had      oh  uh     when you asked     abed    yeah     what's the deal with the hot girl from spanish class   i can't find a road in there     well  i only talked to her once  while she was borrowing a pencil  but     her name is britta  she's 28  birthday in october   she has two older brothers and one of 'em  works with children who have a disorder  i might want to look up   oh  and she thinks she's gonna flunk  tomorrow's test  so she really needs to focus  so she's sorry if that makes her seem cold     holy crap   abed     i see your value now     that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me   absolutely not   if these guys knew you like i did they would have given you a small office     jeff winger   genius at law     you got to stop saying that    i will never do that  sit down  i still cannot figure out how you gonna join  september the 11th with my dui   that alone  why that helped   well  2002 was a simple time   so what is my lawyer doing here     i'm a student     well  that cannot be an inspiring journey     uh  i am in a bit of a jam   the state bar has suspended my license   they found out my college degree was less than legitimate     i thought you had a bachelor's from columbia     now i have to get one from america     and it can't be an email attachment     well  you've picked a fine school     yes  and i'm hoping that our friendship  will yield certain advantages   you know  academic guidance      yes     moral support   every answer to every test  for every one of the classes that i'm taking   here's my schedule    no  now  jeff  just by asking that   you have insulted the integrity of this entire institution   waster  not a bathroom   not a bathroom    okay  duncan  you     did seem less into integrity the day that i convinced   that u turn on the freeway  and tried to order chalupas from the emergency call box   that your only real crime was loving america   well  i do love america  i do love it  very much   i love chalupas   but       i'll look into it    thank you   duncan  you are a good man     jeff  are you familiar with the adage   cheaters never prosper    no     and if i wanted to learn something  i wouldn't have come to community college   transcripted on addic7ed by honeybunny and verdikt      oh  hey  spanish    uh  don't hit on me  okay     whoa   i wouldn't dream of it   i just wanted to let you know about my spanish study group

be there   un po' di piu'   that means  see you there    shouldn't be too hard to fake a study group  right   oh  geez  i'm sorry    i     i was raised on tv and i was conditioned to believe that every     black woman over 50 is a cosmic mentor    were you conditioned to pay for your damn taco  sanfield   yes  i'm so sorry   it's seinfeld   group study room  bienvenido   bienvenuto   hey  all

but you and i can get acquainted     you may have noticed this morning  not so good at the small talk     yeah  i like big talk  what's your deal     that's not small talk    what's your deal and is god dead     all right  you want to know my deal   i dropped out of high school because  i thought for some reason  it would impress radiohead   you'd be surprised what gets back to these guys   i joined the peace corp   i did a little foot modelling   i got tear gased in a world trade rally     marry me   and i think  jeff  my deal is above all else  honesty     honesty    yeah   you tell me the truth  i will like you   you lie to me  i will never talk to you again  that's my deal     ah  that's a good deal    so what's your deal     uh  i would have to go   i would have to say   um  honesty   because     i would say anything to get what i want   and i want you to like me  so  uh      wow  that's a very honest answer   all right  now i like you fine     really  wow  you're easy    hell yeah   abed in the house     why    britta invited me  is that cool     oh  i can't think of a single logical reason why not     cool    there you go   oh  hey  here  put your contact info down right there   that's right    cool  cool  cool   cool  cool  cool   hey  this is kind of like breakfast club  huh     we are in a library    yeah   i'm sure we've each got an issue balled up inside of us  that would make us cry if we talked about it     do you have something balled up inside of you     well  i got a little doozy in the chamber if things get emotional   oh  hey  text message     let's give this bad boy a read    it's probably just for your eyes     i've never got one of these   well  it's jut   you probably       it's probably just for your eyes     say you have to pee  i need to talk to you     say you have to pee      that is weird      say you have to pee  i need to talk to you     do you have to pee     no     hmm     that's so weird    well  i'm stumped  that's very creepy    that's very creepy    does it say you have to pee     no  it's just someone  with a misguided grasp of abbreviation   i just need five minutes  you guys  so go ahead and study  all the verbs   in spanish     abed      yeah   what's your read on that guy   you look like elisabeth shue   act natural  pretend you are watching the athletic proceedings    i couldn't stop watching them   there's a guy going for the track  that's older than the game of poker   he's kinda cracking     suppose i was to say to you it was possible to get those test answers     i would say   go for that   and could have said so in a text     i'm asking you if you know the difference between right and wrong     i discovered at a very early age that if i talk long enough   i could make anything right or wrong   so either i'm god or truth is relative   and in either case  booyah     oh  interesting  it's just the average person has a much harder time saying    booyah   to moral relativism     duncan  you don't have to play shrink  to protect your pride   i accept  you're chicken   are you trying to use reverse psychology on a psychologist   no  i'm just using regular psychology on a spineless  british twit      i'm a professor  you can't talk to me that way     a six year old girl could talk to you that way    yes  because that would be adorable     no  because you're a five year old girl and there's a pecking order     fine  i'll do it    thank you     yeah  pleasure   bye   yes  good   why am i still shouting   i'm drawing attention to myself     you guys aren't gonna believe this  but the rest of the group     is here     are you the board certified tutor     that means you do my homework  right  seacrest     i need to call my babysitter if we're gon' be later than 10 00     what board certifies a tutor     where's britta    not sure   but i invited more people from spanish class  is that cool     it's the coolest   i'm gonna go to the bathroom  and bring my jacket   wallet  and keys with me  in case there's a fire     should we go with him     i'm leaving my homework with slumdog millionaire over here     that's borderline racist  i think     and busted     uh  listen    now you know  i'm a smoker     yeah  but they're filtered  so that makes them safe     you ready to get started  looks like the rest of your group showed up     yeah  not mine  actually  i think abed took out a page on craigslist   and i was trained never to say this   but i think that group may be untutorable     oh  really     so why don't you and i go study over      dinner    or drinks     i think  actually  we should prioritize here  and study first and then go to dinner   and if they really prove to be untutorable  we'll slip out early     oh   they will be     untutorable     all right   look at this crew   all ready to study all night     well  i can stay at least till 10 00     but who studies with strangers  right   my name is jeff     jeff  it's a pleasure   my name is pierce hawthorne and  yes   that is hawthorne as in hawthorne wipes  the award winning moist towellete     i was just going to ask     i'm also a toast master  so perhaps i should do the introductions     definitely    all right  you already know brittles     britta    abed  abed the arab   is that inappropriate    sure     roy  roy the wonder boy     troy      little princess elizabeth     annie      and finally  this beautiful creature is named shirley     is that even close     i'd like to know why i had to find out about this group on accident       this is getting way more like breakfast club now    there's breakfast     okay  um  maybe we should get started      you know  i've been a part of a lot of study groups that fell apart  because of unresolved tension   shouldn't we address annie's concern   did we not invite her     well  annie  sweetie  it's not behind your back     we just didn't think about      can we stop with the  pumpkins  and the  sweeties    being younger does not make me inferior   if anything  your age indicates that you've made bad life decisions     shirley has a response to that    no  no  no  i don't     you should  it looks like you do    please  shirley     okay  okay   i'm sure i've made some bad life decisions  and maybe annie's decisions will be better   but i think she needs to decide whether she wants to be considered a child  or an adult  because children get pity  but not respect  and adults   they get respect   but they also get the back of they head grabbed  and their face pushed through jukeboxes     okay   why don't we try learning  jukebox  in spanish     what are you doing    pierce     let's discuss this creepiness    pardon you     what are you doing    i'm certified   are you unaware that shirley finds your advances inappropriate   what advances     you have been sexually harassing me since the very first day of class     sexually harassing   what  that makes no sense to me   why would i harass somebody who turns me on     saying she turns you on is the harassment  dude     hey   i am a prominent business leader and a highly sought after dinner guest  and i will not take courting advice from some teenage boy   well  this teenage boy  is a quarterback and a prom king     you're not prom king anymore  troy  this isn't riverside high     how'd you know i went there     because you're still wearing your stupid letter jacket   and more importantly  i sat behind you in algebra   wait  you're that girl that got hooked on pills and then dropped out   you're little annie  adderall    yes  and you are a stupid jock who lost his scholarship  by dislocating both shoulders in a keg stand   keg flip  they're very hard to pull off   you don't know   i'm a legend   you know what i got for christmas   it was a banner year at the bender family   i got a carton of cigarettes   the old man grabbed me  he said   hey  smoke up  johnny     no  dad  what about you    well  uh    that    that actually was from the breakfast club   nobody puts baby in the corner   dirty dancing   hello  it's professor duncan   come to the parking lot now   what's wrong with your voice   i'm disguising it   uh  i'll be right back   but while i'm gone  you guys need to hash this stuff out   no stone unturned     go    what does that       i can't feel my     get in the car   act as if either you have just finished or yet to begin driving   every answer to every test in your curriculum this semester   i knew you could do it  buddy  thank you   whoa there  grabby grabby     what do i get    the satisfaction of being even   even  fairness  right  wrong  there is no god     booyah  booyah    what do you want from me     your lexus    my car for a semester's worth of answers   will it be just a semester though  jeff   won't you be taking the easy way out for the next four years   i want payment in advance   i want leather seats with built in ball warmers   you know  bluffs this weak are how your people lost the colonies   have a nice disbarment hearing     what am i supposed to drive    why don't you take this car  it's good for the earth   yeah  so is wiping your butt with a leaf  but it's not how a man gets around   a golf kart     it is a disaster in there    yeah  untutorable     you like thai food  i love thai food    wait     so    this is a game to you   you put human beings into a state of emotional shambles  for a shot at getting in my pants   why can't you see that for the compliment that it is   ok  ok  i'm sorry  it was an accident   i did a little bit of lying  to get close to you   but how was i suppose to know that you were smart and cool     i mean  you look like elisabeth shue     you're unbelievable    what do you want me to do   oh  maybe one decent thing could be to go in there and clean up your mess   okay  i am the barack obama of this room   okay  if i do that  then dinner  right   yeah  fine  whatever   as if there's a dinner on earth that could make me forget you are a shallow douchebag   oh  you're gonna eat those words when you see my new car   all right  everybody   i want to say something  everybody  sit down   you don't have to yell   you know what makes humans different from other animals   feet   no  no  no  come on  bears have feet   we're the only species on earth that observes shark week   sharks don't even observe shark week  but we do   for the same reason i can pick up this pencil  tell you it's name is steve   and go like this   and part of you dies just a little bit on the inside   because people can connect with anything   we can sympathize with a pencil   we can forgive a shark  and we can give ben affleck an academy award for screenwriting     big mistake    he's got a point   people can find the good in just about anything but themselves   look at me  it's clear to all of you that i am awesome   but i can never admit that  because that would make me an ass   but what i can do is see what makes annie awesome   she's driven   we need driven people or the lights go out and the ice cream melts   and pierce  we need guys like pierce   this guy has wisdom to offer     the dalai lama and i     we should listen to him sometime   we wouldn't regret it   and shirley   shirley has earned our respect   not as a wife  not as a mother  but as a woman   and don't test her on that  because that thing about the jukebox  was way too specific to be improvised   and troy   who cares if troy thinks he's all that   maybe he is   you think astronauts go to the moon because they hate oxygen  no   they're trying to impress their high school prom king   and abed   abed's a shaman   you ask him to pass the salt  he gives you a bowl of soup   because you know what  soup is better   abed is better   you are all better than you think you are   you are just designed not to believe it when you hear it from yourself   soup   i want you to look to the person to your left   sorry  look at the person sitting next to you   look at her  okay     this    yeah   i want you to extend to that person  the same compassion that you extend to sharks  pencils  and ben affleck   i want you to say to that person    i forgive you      i forgive you    i forgive you     i forgive you    you little twerp   pierce  i'd like you to say   i forgive you    he didn't say it   i forgive you   you've just stopped being a study group   you have become something     unstoppable   i hereby pronounce you     a community   oh  that's nice   i like that   this isn't like breakfast club anymore   now it's like stripes or meatballs  anything with bill murray  really   i agree with abed that tonight has been very special   and now  if you'll excuse me   i have a dinner engagement with britta   britta   i lied   thanks for calming everyone down   but since you're not a spanish tutor  just a lying creep  who purposely upset everyone in an attempt to get with me   i'd appreciate it if you left and stopped wasting all of our time   everybody ready   fine   and i'm happy to report  that one of the benefits of being a lying creep  is having all the answers to tomorrow's test   and i'm happy to share them with anyone whose time i've wasted more  than they've wasted mine   uh  jeff  if you have all the answers  why the hell did you start this study group   i don't have a study group  pierce  i made it up     what about the  look left  speech    made it up  that's what i do   i make things up  and i got paid a lot of money  to do it before i came to this school shaped toilet   i was a lawyer     oh  god    that explains everything   you know  i thought you were like bill murray in any of his films  but you're more like michael douglas in any of his films     yeah    yeah   well  you have asperger's   what did he say    ass burger      it's a serious disorder    it really is   if it's so serious  why don't they call it meningitis      ass burger     burger for your ass        jeffrey  before you say anything  you may want to think about the gift you've been given     an excuse to punch a hippy    no  no  not that   an important lesson  my friend  you see   the tools you acquired to survive out there will not help you here at greendale   what you have  my friend  is a second chance at an honest life   why are people trying  to teach me things  at a school that has an express tuition aisle     give me the keys    no  i have to keep your car for    don't hit me  please  don't hit me   jeffrey  jeffrey   are we cool   are we cool   we're cool   i like you  jeffrey   you remind me of myself at your age   i deserve that   you know   i've been divorced  seven times   sometimes  i think i'm doing something wrong   you keep getting married   i never looked at it that way   shouldn't you guys be studying   yeah  things got kind of boring after you left   let me ask you something   people becloud me for wearing this jacket ever since i got here  but   if i take it off to make them happy   that just makes me weak  right   listen   it doesn't matter   you lose the jacket to please them  you keep it to piss them off   either way  it's for them   that's what's weak    wow   you just wrinkled my brain  man     he's good  isn't he    he's really good   shouldn't you be rolling around on a bed covered in test answers   i don't have any of the answers   i'm gonna   i'm gonna flunk the test   you just  like  study for  like  an hour  it's not that hard   you seem pretty smart  you got a sports coat   i am me     well  the funny thing about being smart  is that you can get through most of life without ever having to do any work   so  uh     i'm not really sure how to do that    what's going on   can you guys hear me  am i deaf     can you hear me talking right now    yes   that's good   you know what   jeff  actually  we didn't get that far without you  so  if you want to come back upstairs    really   well  it is your study group  so   come on  let's study   sounds good   no pressure   i'm sorry i called you michael douglas and i see your value now   well  that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me   transcripted on addic7ed by honeybunny   verdikt
