 no  ma'am   i'm not     what happened   well  if you're gonna have an asthma attack   at least you had the good sense to have it near me   here   what is this   you breathe it in   it stops the attack before it starts   you're a doctor   it was my son's   now you wanna explain this   i was running away from some soldiers   monroe's boys   yes   did they follow you here   look  look  i don't

sorry   i wish i could've     why did monroe want my dad   and why does he want you   monroe thinks your dad knew something   something important   and he thinks your dad told me   so i must know it too   what   why the lights went out   maybe how to turn 'em back on   if monroe got the power going   that would mean tanks and planes   factories   he'd steamroll the entire continent   and he'd butcher the other republics   okay   so what do we do now   what do we do now about what   how are we gonna get danny back   i didn't say i was going with you   what   in case you haven't noticed   i'm trying to maintain a certain low profile here   no  look  look  i'm begging you   your brother is bait   you understand that   i go after it  not good for him     or for me   i  for one  would like to keep my insides on the inside   no  no  look  i have     i have lost everyone that i care about   my mom is dead   my dad is dead   and god knows what they're doing to danny right now   so you are gonna help me get him back   why's that   because we're family   family   kid  i don't even know you   yeah  you're right   it was stupid of me to ask   sorry to bother you   what's wrong     let's get outta here    charlie  what's wrong     nothing  let's go    tell me   hey  hey  hey  what happened   nothing  let's just go   let's just go   hey  hold on   step back   so what'd you say to her  huh   militia  huh   when'd you enlist   uncle miles  this is my fault   i'm    i'm so sorry   he's probably from the same unit  that took your brother   been following you from the get go   hoping you'd flush me out   which is exactly what you did  isn't it   so what are you gonna do   this  as far as i know   is the last bottle of single malt in chicago   my plan is to sit here and drink it   you can't just stay here  it's not safe   whose fault is that  your boyfriend   he's gonna go and get the nearest squad   two maybe three hours tops is what you got   so if i were you guys  i'd hit the road   this is crazy   just come with us   or don't  that's fine  but go somewhere   you can't just sit here and die   just go   uncle miles  come on   i said go   get out  get outta here   good morning  may i help you   sorry to bother you  but we're looking for a dangerous  young fugitive    you're the first person i've seen in weeks   what did you do before the blackout   sorry   just curious   humor me  please   i taught algebra   me  i was an insurance adjuster   most of my job was figuring out  whether the things people said lined up with the truth   lucky for me   it's a skill that never goes out of style   so take  for example  those tracks  that lead right to your back door   tracks   fresh ones   about a day old   two people   a woman  who would have to be you   dragging in a man  and yet you say  that i'm the first person you've seen in weeks   so tell me  does that sound like the truth to you     he's gotta be long gone   if he's here  monroe wants him alive   come on down   we don't wanna hurt you   i don't wanna hurt them   but i'm not going back   you know  you could just let me go   i'll drink myself to death   you know we can't do that   i know   take him   now     shoot him               charlie   you okay     you know  i didn't ask you to come back   don't look at me  i wanted to let you rot   why didn't you   because we're family   and that's what my dad would have wanted   kid  if i'm coming with you   you're gonna have to dial it back a notch   you're coming   loverboy will just send more troops   i can't stay here   thank you   you're welcome   we're all gonna end up with our heads on a stick   but you're welcome   bass  what the hell is going on   i don't know  but we should get back to base   this is not good   halt right there  gentlemen   i d 's   sergeant miles matheson   you're good   i i don't     well  he knows me   sergeant sebastian monroe   you're good   miles   general monroe       sync   corrections by
