   bones  over here    where have you been   you said you'd meet us on the corner   there's a lot going on  in case you haven't noticed   these girls  they're with me   dr  temperance  brennan  angela montenegro from the jeffersonian     i need id    check the ri 5 list  homeland security   she's their forensic anthropologist     they're clear    thanks   come on   god  what's that smell   burnt flesh   are there a lot of injuries   four known dead  15 injured   oh  my god     details  whatever you have   not much  witnesses said they saw a middle eastern man   mid 30s  pull up to the cafe  and the car just blew   the vehicle's registered to hamid masruk   head of the arab american friendship league   if you know who it is  why do you need me   because we're hoping we're wrong   masruk is a white house consultant in arab relations  had lunch with the president just last week   you remember agent gibson  homeland security   dr  temperance brennan and angela montenegro   if masruk was involved  in a terrorist attack  it means we have a huge  national security problem    not to mention  a very humiliated president   the press is already running with this     if you think i'm gonna alter my      not at all   maybe it's not masruk   we need to be sure   booth says you're the best   i need surgical gloves and masks  for the retrieval team   sterile medical bags and vegetable oil   vegetable oil   the oil will loosen the seared body parts stuck to the metal   it's no different than a steak on a grill that sticks   it's okay  you know  i trust you   should i photograph the scene   focus on 30 meter radius from the blast   okay to pick up   ya know  that's okay to be upset   i wish this is the worst thing i've seen   you know  uh     i don't think i can     sorry   well  if you can't either     i'm cool   zack  i need two more evidence bags   facial epidermis and the fingertips are completely decimated   we're not going to be able to id anything from the flesh   it's basically carbon   we're missing the lower left leg  and the lumbar spine    here's c2  and the right ischium   if smokey here had access to the president  why would he attack a cafe   smokey   it's how i deal with stress   targeting everyday places causes panic   people stay home   the economy is crippled   it's terrorism 101  man   take samples from the clothes  see whatever you can find   traces of cologne  laundry detergent     anything that we can link to masruk's home   i'll grab any particulates that can identify type of bomb   isn't that the fbi's job   you trust the fbi   you realize those guys are gonna suppress whatever they need  to cover their asses   found a portion of the clavicle     are you even listening    no   they have a separate division  you know   that way their hands are always clean   in 1974     jack   we're trying to work   someone seems really defensive  about the fbi lately   you realize booth is just  another government stooge     this has nothing to do with booth   i don't enjoy having squints on my team  any more than you like me on yours   but  you know  we're supposed to be working together   okay   sure  so what do we do   group hug   agent gibson here will be overseeing things for homeland security   i'll try not to be in the way   we don't need to be overseen   that's really  not your call  bones   how soon can we get the dna match   that'll take days   i can get a match much sooner than that   i have all we need   you're gonna be able to id him from that   asking stuff like that is  in the way    remove any flesh and particulates you can   and then macerate him   if that's all right with you   don't touch the table   don't touch the table   this is my lab   i'm a scientist  a doctor   ah  so i've heard   would you be able to do your job if someone was  looking over your shoulder all the time   we do  ok  i developed a tolerance   sorry  but i don't understand the advantage of compromise   it's a terrorist attack  bones   it's bigger than you and it's bigger than me     the job is the same    no  it's not   we're dealing with someone here who devalues an entire culture   terrorizing people by using god to justify mass murder   you're making it personal   that doesn't help   it is personal  bones   all of us die a little bit on one like this   all the trace evidence has been stripped   hodgins scavenged as much as he could   okay  let's get started   what the hell are those   dermestes maculatus   flesh eating beetles   it's how we clean the bones of burn victims   gibson   yes  sir   yes  sir   the president wants to know how long the id is going to take   why don't you ask them   episode 1x02   the man in the suv  transcript by cfsmp3      only for  you've made a mistake   it can't be my husband   my brother was no terrorist   he hated those people   you can read his speeches  talk to anyone   we aren't making any accusations   it's all over the news  it's all anyone's talking about   we can't control the press  mr  masruk   how about your men   they've searched our house   they've talked to our friends   until we can identify the body   we have to conduct a thorough investigation   so identify the body   the longer you wait     do you know what it's like for us   his body was fragmented by the blast   we're still retrieving pieces     i understand how difficult this is  not knowing   i'll work as quickly as i can to get you what you need   that's why i asked for his history  where he grew up   any injuries from his youth  medical records     of course   i brought you what you asked for   thank you   we lived just like you   we came to this country because we love it   we are americans   it can't be hamid   it can't   my husband was not a terrorist   could be a perchlorate   wouldn't that be used in a bomb   yeah  but this is a crystalline structure   aluminum based   okay  i'm back   how are we doing   we have his detergent brand  cologne  shampoo   he died a well groomed man   thanks   the bones done yet   i'll check the beetles   dr  brennan  whatever you have there     it's a piece of paper  that's all  with some writing on it   hard at work   there's a shocker   i just saw his wife   she gave me his medical records  photographs     apparently he was ill   they were testing for lupus   which would explain the face     it must've been painful   look  i     i know that you needed help out there    at the crime scene     and i wanted to  but     it's okay   you see it   i don't anymore   i don't know what's worse   you holding up okay   his wife doesn't believe it was him   i've got to give her an id   whatever i can do   yeah  i know   and about this weekend     angela  i don't know   oh  come on  brennan  i know this great club     they play trip hop and trance    i don't know what that means   it doesn't matter   we'll grab booth     i think he likes you   god  if i were you  i'd buy a ticket on that ride   look  i'm going to be very busy this weekend   even after the id  i have these     remains from world war i   that's what the institute pays me for   i've got hundreds of these waiting   and they can't wait one more weekend   they've got relatives   they've waited long enough   it's not that scary  brennan   you have a few drinks  you move to the music     you might even smile   the bones are clean   i've got to run   you hang around  i may need you   comparing remains to details provided  of hamid masruk   age 37  of afghani origin   texture of pubic symphysis indicates age of bone  consistent with masruk  as is height   complexity of the cranial vault sutures matches  a statistical probability of eurasian descent       good    too bad we can't tell why he did it   isn't that what we all really want to know   uneven growth patterns in the vertebrae  indicate malnourishment as a child   consistent with the diet where masruk was from   probably evident on the calvarium   why don't you reconstruct the skull  check it out   my first cranial reconstruction   evidence of multiple fractures  to the bottoms of the feet  consistent with methods of torture used in afghanistan  and consistent with masurk's history   i'm convinced   we have a statistical match     so masruk is the bomber    yes   what about the skull  you're having the kid reconstruct     this is an educational institute  he wants to learn   is that okay with you   for a forensic i d   we have what we need   now  i'd like to get this data to booth as soon as i can   i'll take it   no  i don't think so  i work with booth   that's my deal   dr  brennan  i have jurisdiction   then why don't i destroy my notes  and let you guarantee the identity of the remains   it's best to just ride it out     like an earthquake   bones     did we have an appointment    no  i     it's him   masruk is the bomber   i guess the wife didn't know the husband very well   hi  sorry   tessa  this is brennan   tessa jankow  dr  temperance brennan   oh  hi   i've heard a lot about you   really       tessa's an attorney    mm  corporate   keeping the fat cats fat   i was just studying a cranial fissure on a  corporate attorney last week   of course  he was    dead  so     interesting   thanks   well  the bureau   i was just heading to the bureau  santana called   said  uh  something about the bombing   and i thought you were at the lab   maybe  uh  you should come   sure   see you later   what is so funny   i just never figured you'd be in a relationship   why  do you think something's wrong with me   no  not wrong   you just have alpha male attribute  usually associated with a solitary existence   oh  me  you're solitary    no  i'm private  it's different     and we weren't talking about me    i was   well  i wasn't  look  i'm happy for you   relationships have anthropological meaning   no society can survive  if sexual bonds aren't forged between     what the hell are you talking about     booth    yeah     you got that i d     yeah  it was masruk   oh  that's too bad   he killed four people and injured another 15   the report came back from ballistics   now  the explosives were placed underneath the car  with a trigger connected to the odometer   masruk was murdered   so masruk wasn't a terrorist   somebody tried to make him look like one   any leads on who did it   that's why we're paying you booth   we're very sorry  mrs  masruk   i told you hamid was the victim  but you wouldn't listen   you couldn't imagine an arab who was a peace loving man     that's not true   no   we must investigate everything  mrs  masruk   we must turn your house upside down because we believe  your husband was a good man   is that the truth   no  they searched your house because muslim extremists have declared war  on the united states   preliminary findings made your husband a suspect   which we are required to      it's not bureau policy  to target or profile any ethnic group   it wasn't our intention  but i can understand why  you may feel offended     i can't    bones     what   she's been a part of a criminal investigation  that's all   her rights haven't been violated   it's unfortunate that her husband's ethnicity is a factor   but to say that it isn't would be disingenuous   i have to apologize for dr  brennan   it's fine  mr  booth   honesty is always a welcome relief   so when can i bury him   when can i give him peace   there are certain body parts that i'm still examining   others are still seared to the surface of the wreckage   i'm sure mrs  masruk doesn't really need to know the details     if i can retrieve more remains of her husband   muslim law requires that i do   i spent some time in iraq identifying bodies   i'll give you whatever i can  so that he can be purified for burial   thank you   is that all   one last thing  a few calls were made to  uh     his cell phone from your house   minutes before the blast     yes  we argued   it was a family matter   my final words to him were words of anger   i'm very sorry   that must be very painful   you looked very happy in that picture   thank you  if there's anything else that  you know   you can think of  just give us a call   i think she's having an affair   personally   she was having an affair   i'm sorry  but that's an offensive assumption   all the signs are there   you can't make wild accusations about somebody's personal life  based on a feeling    it's more than a feeling  okay   that photograph is evidence just as solid as the markers  that you squints pick up looking at your little bones   the evidence i find is empirical   what you consider evidence is merely conjecture   she dyed her hair  she lost weight  you know   she shoved a little botox in her forehead   and she's still feeling guilty over the last fight she had  with her husband   you are an insufferable  arrogant     man   oh  so only a woman can know a woman  i thought women wanted us to understand them   not really   a magician never wants to reveal her tricks     we're having a private conversation    i'm not here   so you think you know women just because you live  with some sexy lawyer  unbelievable   you live with a sexy lawyer   she has her own place  okay   he thinks just because masruk's wife  started working out  had a little makeover   that she's having an affair     how long were they married    11 years   i'm with him   there is no concrete proof     boobs perkier    mm hmm   i don't believe this   if you're so sure  then why didn't you confront her   because if she or her boyfriend were involved   she would warn him    very good   i'm a constant surprise   all right  great   i will be in the lab getting us some real data   so     how many nights a week does  sexy  sleep over   how's it coming   the ethmoid and sphenoid fragments won't piece together   zack  i'd like to return the remains to the widow before her demise   i'm doing my best  dr  brennan   the integrity of the bone seems to be compromised   i don't know if it's from the metal fragments from the blast   i examined the chemicals used in the explosives   the perchlorates i found can have a degenerative effect   not this quickly  excuse me   unusually soft bone tissue     you know  this has nothing to do with the blast   i owe you an apology  zack   do you have his medicals   stiff joints  facial disfigurement     there's a disorganized trabecular pattern here  that his doctors wouldn't have been able to see   it could be a degenerative disease   i don't get it   how does his medical condition figure into the murder   now it's a murder   before  it was terrorism  because we didn't have all the facts   you don't overlook anything when you're looking for the truth   check for lupus and paget's   do you have enough tissue     yeah  i can manage it    if those come back negative   he might have been exposed to a toxin   which would mean his brother was  too   he's exhibiting similar symptoms   i'll get the brother's medicals   i graduated top of my class  rhodes scholar  the youngest member inducted into the academy of physical sciences   but she still makes me feel like a cretin   she apologized to me   yes  i am a christian   but hamid is a muslim  and sahar     i converted   hamid could never accept it   religious differences cause too many problems   seems to be a consistent fact throughout history   please   i tried to make peace with my brother  but it was difficult   there was more than religion between us   sahar mentioned that there were some  uh  family problems   yes  i can understand how  uh  delicate they can be   did she tell you any more than that   no  but  i mean  if you have  uh   any other information that could help us in the investigation     it's not my place   we're just trying to find out who killed your brother   sahar was seeing another man   but i can't believe she'd hurt my brother   do you know who this other man is   or is it just a feeling you have   i've met him   ali ladjavardi   he worked with hamid at the friendship league   i wanted hamid to confront ladjavardi   did both you and hamid have contact with ladjavardi   yes  once  a meal   i brought hamid to meet him   sharing a meal is a gesture of peace   i was trying to save their marriage  but sahar and ladjavardi  were not going to stop their affair   so i told hamid to repudiate her   i'm sorry   in muslim law  it's a method of divorce  it's called talaq   i still respected his traditions   you and your brother seem to share a medical condition     why is that important    we don't mean to embarrass you   but dr  brennan is just trying to figure out the condition   it's routine  part of the investigation     have you seen a doctor    yes   he believes it's a genetic disorder we share   he was going to call hamid's physician to discuss it   would you mind if we saw your medical records   of course not   if i could be helped  i welcome it   apparently  they live together a few days a week   but he was very clear that she has her own place   should you be intruding into their lives like this     oh  yeah  absolutely    we're negative for lupus and paget's   when you're done  i'll do a scraping for environmental contaminants   i found these   shiny flakes that caught onto the torn edges of bone   bottom line  i still think brennan has a shot with booth   but she says she's not interested   methinks the lady doth protest too much   maybe she protesteth just enough  please   she's been sleeping alone for months   she has enough pent up sexual energy  to power a small midwestern city   this looks like gypsum   it wouldn't cause any organic damage   it was probably used to insulate the explosives   bet the fbi doesn't know that yet   i'm going to go check out this girlfriend   i'm not proud of the affair   i admired hamid   but sahar and i are in love  i can't change that   you worked with hamid     you had access to his car    that's ridiculous   you also had contact with his brother  farid   who said you were less than friendly with hamid   have you ever been in the middle of a messy relationship  agent booth   or are you a perfect man   i'd prefer to ask the questions  mr  ladjavardi   and i have the right for an attorney  have you called the number i gave you   of course  you know  i would never deny anyone his rights   mr  ladjavardi     i'm special agent in charge santana   we're sorry for the inconvenience  you're free to go   thank you     you're finished    what the hell was that all about   he was a prime suspect   he's a mole for homeland security   they planted him in the arab american friendship league   he admitted the affair   maybe  but homeland security says he's clean   they do not want his cover blown     but  sir      do i look like i'm discussing this   come on   you want me to drive   no  why     you're angry    i'm not angry   yeah  you're furious  you're going to kill somebody   i am not angry   believe me  you do not want to see me angry   that's the last thing you want to see   this is me accepting reality   okay  my mistake   my superiors  they make the decisions  bones  all right   they don't think them through  that's really not my problem   if i were you  i'd be mad   homeland security is preventing you  from doing a proper investigation of a murder case   i'm a grown up  i'll deal   you know that thing where you ask for the strength  to change the things that you can  and the wisdom to know the difference   not really   well  that's a good thing   who do you ask     for what    for the strength and the wisdom   god   and it works   can we talk about something else   sure  tessa   tessa  no     why do you want to talk about tessa    why  why not   i'm sorry  we won't talk about tessa   i prefer if we would just stay on point  and talk about things that you like to talk about  like dead people  dead bodies   sure  sure  you've killed a lot of people  right   when you were a sniper   maybe we shouldn't talk at all   right  'cause you're angry   i'm not angry  not   we'll find out who killed him  booth   we've got hamid's body   you can always count on the dead   when booth sends over the brother's medicals  i want them matched to hamid's   i'm starting on a tox screen   farid said that his doctor suspected a genetic condition   maybe we're overlooking something   what is that   we used the trace elements we recovered to try and rebuild the bomb   it might give you another link   isn't the fbi working on that   yeah   this is just for fun   to see who's better   maybe   a little   yeah   good luck    ta da   nice job   no wonder you had such trouble with the reconstruction   look at the spread of the trabecular pattern in the bone   microscopic fissures  like cracks     i knew that    i don't think so   can we focus   the spread was too rapid for any organic bone disease  or genetic condition  it's definitely a toxin   is there any surviving marrow to test   i'll try and find some   let's do it   the marrow's degraded   i can give you basics  but that's it   well  according to these tests  the liver function was impaired   his body was trying to get rid of whatever was poisoning him   there is trouble in paradise   i beg your pardon   tessa does not feel secure in that relationship     i think she's threatened by you    you talk to her   she didn say much   but even though she has a phenomenal figure   she was chowing down on a fat free muffin   and she was reading a book about unsolved fbi cases   she's obviously feeling insecure   she's spying for you   even if you have nothing in common   it's difficult to sublimate intense sexual attraction   and we hear it's been a while   okay  stop   he is there for the taking  honey   okay  i couldn't get his medical records     what    uh  nothing   trying to track down the doctor   don't need him   it's definitely a toxin     but we can't determine what kind    too bad the liver is cooked   that could tell us everything    the liver is like a filter   it would contain evidence of any toxins in the system   but we don't have the liver or any of the flesh left   but we do have the beetles   they ate hamid's flesh and whatever organs remained   and as we all know  you are what you eat   so you can i d  the poison from the beetles   you can't kill them   they have names   we have to  zack   some   in thailand  they're saut ed in peanut oil   we're going to have to run a simulation   i need you to input the skull and give me a face   you got it   and no more talk about booth   you shouldn't have gotten involved     but that's what friends are for    please  angela     hey  whoa  where did you get this   i'm building it    theoretical construct of the bomb based on the particulates we gathered   this isn't your job  the bureau's doing this   got it   they were poisoned by dioxin  a very pure form   it would stay in his system for years   cause cancer  diabetes  heart attack  and the facial cysts and bone degeneration we saw   give me the saturation levels  angela can use it in the simulation  to give us an approximate date of ingestion     how much would it take to poison them    just a little slipped into their food   like at that lunch they both had with sahar's lover   impressed   dioxin levels were 5 600 parts per trillion   speed of bone degeneration is an 80  increase over baseline osteoporosis   date of death was     i remember that one  thanks   run the scenario   i will never get used to this   chicks with toys   poor bastard   match it to his ins photograph  see how accurate you are   good work  angela   probable date of exposure     about four months ago  i'd say first week in june   let's go pay a little visit to mr ladjavardi   i thought you were told to stay away from him   yeah  and  as an fbi agent  i cannot disobey my superior   but you're not an fbi agent   hey  hi   how you doing   what the hell are you doing here     you had orders    no  not me   i    i just have a couple of quick questions for you   look  i'm not involved in this     sahar won't even talk to me anymore    yeah  i wonder why     i'm calling santana    yeah  i don't think so   i'm warning you   i wouldn't threaten her if i were you   look  i just want to know where you were  in june  first week  to see if you poisoned hamid and farid     subtle    i'm leaving  that's it   told you  she doesn't like to be touched   i didn't poison anybody   then tell me where you were in june   in utah  for training with homeland security   i didn't get to d c  until august 12  check with the department   all right   thanks   the insulation they used is gypsum based   with plaster and lead mixed with asbestos   pyrobar   it's a fireproof tile developed in 1903  by the united states gypsum company   it was only used for a few years   so it probably came from the building the bomb was constructed in   we find the building  and we find the bomber   how about this   sahar wants out of the marriage  hamid refuses   so sahar poisons him so that she can run off with lajavardi   doesn't make sense   when someone dies  the first suspect is the spouse   well  at about hamid's brother  did she poison him  too   why not  he's pushing his nose into their marriage   suddenly  sahar is facing a devout muslim  and a fundamentalist christian   and  you know  nobody allows divorce   and she's pushed to murder    that eschews logic   come on  bones  just work with me here    it's what we in law enforcement call positing a scenario   and don't use the word eschew   what if you and tessa were going to break up  but you didn't want to     which i don't    well i'm positing a scenario  tessa wants to break up  an you don't want to  so she poisons you   and then  just to make sure  she blows you up with a bomb     why would tessa do that    exactly  thank you   'cause tessa and i    that's a bad example   you're a couple in love  right   why do you keep bringing up tessa   i mean  why  what's the big deal   is it so odd for you that i have someone in my life   we were talking about couples   it's a natural segue   you know  you have to quit using the word segue and eschew   all right  they sound french   you keep changing the subject   i get it  you're sensitive about you and tessa   why aren't we talking about you and your boyfriend   i don't have a boyfriend   you just said that as though it's a good thing   and you know what  it's a very  very  sad  comment on your personal life   look  you're angry again   brennan   the bomb insulation was made from pyrobar   which was used by an architect named william allard   he was known for developing the woodley park neighborhood  around 1910   hang on a second  zack     the bomb was made in woodley park    that's where farid lives   okay  hold on   no wonder we couldn't get his medicals   he already knew what was poisoning him   just stay in contact with your boys   and tell them we're going to need them   listen  bones  we're heading into a very unknown situation   i think it's best that you just stay in the car   okay  then  you know  if you have to come in with me   then you stay behind me   fine  just be careful  all right   okay  anybody asks  that door was open   stay right here   fbi  farid   show yourself   clear   can you get me hodgins   farid was making something here   i've got melted plastic  bottles of chlorine     dioxin  that's how you'd make it   bones   the insulation   farid definitely made the bomb  he killed his brother     stay with me  hodgins    yeah  yeah  yeah   hamid must have been killed  because he found his brother making dioxin   all right  that's probably how they got contaminated   come on  mechanic's guide for hamid's suv   page on the odometer    dog eared   he wasn't a christian   deceit in the service of allah is holy   the koran   no  an imam's twisted interpretation of the koran   so that mass murders don't have to feel guilt   he's made another bomb   it's out there  right now   i'm convinced   what's the dispersal rate for a bomb packed with  say   two liters of dioxin   a homemade device similar to the car bomb   that could be 300 to 500 meters   if the victims weren't killed   they'd develop cancer  blindness  lesions  diabetes     today's day is marked   call homeland security  they'll secure the apartment   there's a convenience store across the street from farid's apartment   the owner saw him get on to a bus and head downtown   we're not sure what bus   booth is checking with the fbi now   if you find anything     i know  it's just these bus schedules are totally confusing   yeah  we saw his datebook  he had 5 30 circled   just check anything that has anything to do with 5 30    begins  ends  whatever  yeah   i'm not going anywhere   angela's checking  too   i still don't understand why farid would kill his brother   because both of them were developing symptoms  man   and people were going to start asking questions   and then farid would have been exposed  he had a mission to accomplish   how the hell does he think he's bringing about a better world  by blowing people up   fanaticism and logic don't go hand in hand   it's almost 5 30  come on  angela   anything between woodley park and downtown   three movies start at 6 00   there's a lecture at fuller hall on birds   i can't imagine that will be crowded   and a peace conference at the hamilton cultural center   there'll be speeches by arab moderates and a congressman   that looks like the one   peace conference  hamilton cultural center  that's it   that's got to be it  okay  gibson  just get your boys  over to the hamilton cultural center   just keep them back when you get there   you understand me  if you spook this guy   he'll blow himself up before we can take him out     thanks  angela    bye  bye     you know  you don't have to come    you've got to be kidding me   we'll start down here and we'll make our way upstairs   welcome to the hamilton cultural center peace conference   we would ask that all delegates check in at the orientation     located at the east atrium before     for the keynote speaker address   there are too many ways in   where are the reinforcements   aren't there always reinforcements     they're downstairs tying up the horses    sarcasm doesn't help   ok they're mobilising squad team and additional agents  but it takes time   if farid has the bomb   spots them  that could be bad     if you see him  will you shoot    well  he might not have the bomb   you don't believe that   i'm not taking out a target  bones  unless i'm sure   is that how you make it easier   calling him a target   you know  you really picked an odd time to have this conversation   booth   farid   there  that's farid   i'm not sure   look  his walk is labored from the dioxin poisoning   and the parietal bones in his skull match his picture   his back's to us  what if you're wrong   this is what i do  booth  do you really want to wait   he's carrying something heavy in his camera bag   see  the actual weight is causing his shoulder to       no  i can't    he has all the markers  booth     i need a face  i need a face    farid   on the ground   he's going for the bomb   i told them to tell the press that it was an undercover operation   but it would be a rose garden ceremony   that's an honor  right   i thought you fbi guys liked your medals   there's no pleasure in taking someone's life   it's nothing to celebrate   you saved so many people  booth   don't forget that   want another drink   shouldn't you be getting home   tessa will be worried about you   i guess i should   thanks for your help  bones   sure
