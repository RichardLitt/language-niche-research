mir   fringe  oh my god   what  this bed is loud   you think   we can't keep doing this  sneaking around   department is not a master fan of office romance  the policy seminar was endless  wasn't it   kept finding myself staring at you  i decided to move my chair to stop   well  i think charlie knows   no  he doesn't   well  i think he does   if he knew  we would be transferred   believe me  i'm not afraid of transparency   but we're already working for a department that's about as fluid and unstable as they come  and somehow we found each other   the idea somebody making a call whether not you and i get to live in the same city is unacceptable to me   anyway that's just a preamble to a kicker  which is that  i love you   olivia dunham   yes  sir  of course  sir   yes  sir  i'm on my way   incident at logan  international flight  charlie is on his way   agent scott   logan airport  boston  olivia dunham  fbi        it's all i'm asking for  alright  we didn't know  you had that information  i didn't   why i don't take my guys  get in and do the job    charlie  what's up   interagency harmony and cooperation continues   who's winning   langley  by a nose   we've got a flight out of hamburg  147 passengers   tower has lost contact three hours in  they thought it might have been electrical interference   they enter in our airspace radio silent   navy then scrambles two f 18 for escort   they reported stains on the windows  no signs of life aboard the jet   white house approved the cdc's request for the jet not to be opened until they arrive   no signs of life  who was flying the plane   logan is one of the first airports with the pearl autopilot system   plane landed itself right on time  unlike every flight i've ever taken       well  let me assure you  we'd be happy to treat you as family too   good old ntsb  they all like to think they're cops   agent scott   agent francis   agent dunham   whatever the hell mcneary shot through that window  it made him throw up in front of his whole unit   excuse me  so what's going on here  some sort of an accident   the tarmac is closed  nothing you need to worry about   all right   move on   i'll do that   although this is a joint task force  you are all reporting to the department of homeland security   i'm special agent in charge  broyles   dc has sent me here to make sure we get results   standard level 4 hasmat suits are required to go in   members from each agency of the starting line as follows   cia  faranough  fbi  francis and scott   everyone else stand by  ok people  let's move   sir  olivia dunham   fbi's interagency liaison   liaison on an interagency task force  got to love that   kinnda like powdered sugar on a glazed doughnut   excuse me  if i'm gonna do my job effectively  i'd like my information first hand  that's not redundancy  that's accountability   i know exactly who you are   you want in  liaison  suit up   what kind of terrorism is this   who says it's terrorism        sources tell us  that the plane was deliberately set ablaze by the cdc    federal building  boston   i've got 15e   seat 21a  john rosenblum  honolulu hawaii   43e  elle hampton  florida         i think my x ray's negative   intelligence check's negative     have we reviewed video from hamburg airport      ground crew who fuelled the airplane  we need names    on it's way  agent dawson  and what the hell is taking so long      report says maintenance replaced oxygen tank an hour before take off   please tell me that terminal shut down   it's been down since 4 00 local time  you got any more questions   who's point from cdc on the bone  tissue and air sample   agent pailey  you want his home number   no  but i'd like the whole report  not just this fax   claiming that there's no matches to any known pathogens or airborne viruses   we're on that too liaison   we don't think what happened on that plane was a result of the in flight movie   back bay pd got a call at 3 00  from a guard on duty from a storage facility   he saw two  and i quote  'suspicious middle eastern men handing a white guy a briefcase'   liaison  take it  go find out   take what  that   you're telling me that's my assignment   yea  honey  would you mind        cdc's control  the decision was made to burn the plane only after       u case storage  back bay  massachusetts  petty bastard  he's pissed because his best friend sexually assaulted three marine privates   and i'm the bad guy  cause i put him away   broyles is an idiot   you're smarter  stronger  you're much better looking  he's jealous   what   you said you loved me  in the motel   yea   that was a big deal   yea  well you didn't say anything back  so i just let it go   i've been sorta bad at this  for a long time  until you   i wanted to say  i love you too   let's go check the trash together   empty   acetylene  propane   no  ammonia   what are you doing   what are you doing  i'm a federal agent   we need to get a chem transport team out here now   i'm on it   no signal   freeze fbi  fbi freeze  i have a gun  i will shoot   john   we have a runner in the back   i'm on my way   hands in the air   no   you were very lucky today  agent dunham   your wounds could easily have been more severe   agent scott  wasn't as fortunate  while he survived the initial blast   agent scott was exposed to some synthetic chemical compounds  work that was done in the lab you found   isolation units  kennedy wing  he's not contagious  but until we understand more it's better not to introduce any additional contaminates   we haven't been able to identify  the cdc has sent in specialists  but they've never seen anything like what's happening here   we've put agent scott in a drug induced coma  his body temperature has been lowered significantly to try to slow the progress   i'm sorry agent dunham   it's me  liaison   i found a connection between the hamburg flight and what's happed to agent scott   his name is walter bishop  he's a scientific researcher from cambridge  born in '46   harvard educated post grad at oxford and mit  look at the experiments he was doing in the '70   i believe dr  bishop might have information's that might tell us what happened aboard that plane and save agent scotts life   it says the guy has been at st  claire's for 17 years   i saw that   an assistant was killed in his lab  rumors about dr  bishop using humans as guinea pigs  he was charged with manslaughter  but was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial   why are you so sure bishop's our guy   why are you so sure he's not   listen  dunham   you and i got on a wrong foot   if my past job performance as us marine special investigator offends you      well  yea   it does   a man that serves his country for 30 years has a few drinks and small lapse of judgment     a small lapse in judgment that will haunt three young women for the rest of their lives   but that's not tonight's business  is it   look  dc has tasked me to make sure that our reaction to flight 627 is beyond reproach   now  it says here  in 1991   the glorious state of massachusetts forbade dr  bishop from having any visitors  with the exception of immediate family   so  from where i sit  barging into mental institution   waving the patriot act  which is what you need  and demanding face time with some old lab rat  who you think  might be behind some of the most terrifying terror that i can possibly imagine      i'm coming to you with a solid lead and your personal resentment is preventing you      then you're wasting your breath and my time   do you understand 'immediate family'   you want to question dr  bishop you go find his next of kin and have him escort you in   talk to bishop  uncover something  until then  i am not so convinced  now  can you handle that   he does have a son   is his son a local too   not exactly   baghdad  iraq  so this guy's walter bishop's son   his name is peter bishop   he's a high school drop out  iq at  misfit  nomad  hasn't kept a job longer than two months   he's been a wild land fireman  cargo pilot and briefly a college chemistry professor   he falsified a degree from mit  he even managed to get a few papers published before he was found out   sounds like a massive pain in the ass   my resume is hardly traditional  but around these parts traditional increasingly means irrelevant   hundred billion dollar sunk in infrastructure and you can barely keep the lights on   you need someone to oversee construction on 600 miles of pipeline to carry crude between your fields in kirkuk and the port of ceyhan   a job well out of green zone  i might add  well  i'm still alive to do so   you need someone who has a handle on the laws of hydro dynamic resistance  the heat exchange and oil mixture flows   you'll also need someone who can work with mixed integer programs cause you're gonna have to resize the pipes a you start working across uneven terrain   that is  if you want to keep down the construction costs   truth is  i need this job as much as you need me to do it   i also speak farsi   and 600 000 all in sounds fair   peter bishop  olivia dunham  i'm with the fbi   ok   you heard of the flight 627   the hamburg flight  of course   you may be able to help us with that   no  i think you've got the wrong guy   your father is walter bishop   the last time someone asked me that it was an accusation   well  he's the man we're looking to speak with   but do to his current status  you're the only one who can provide us access   and what possible help could that man be to you   and what is it exactly that you're expecting me to do  hopp on a plane with you back to massachusetts   i just got here honey   i can have you on a return flight here in four days  but first      let me save you the time   i'd rather stay here in iraq  that's how much i want to see my father   i'm going to beg you as one human being to another  your father may be able to save someone who is dying   someone i care about very much   sweetheart  we all care about someone who is dying  i can't help you  i'm sorry   i know why you're here   i have your file   what file   the one the fbi would say it doesn't exist   and it has everything  where you've been  what you're running from   and what you need while you're here   so  either you come with me  or i let certain people know your whereabouts   when do we leave   did the doctor say anything else  yeah   thanks  charlie   let me ask you something   my father  not my favorite   he is without a doubt the most self absorbed  twisted  abusive  brilliant  myopic son of a bitch on the planet   so he was a chemist  that much i already know   he worked out of a basement lab in harvard  doing research for a toothpaste company   i also know that there was an accident at the lab one night  when my father was arrested   beginning the first truly peaceful period in our home  but here is the thing olivia   my gut tells me  that your friend's life  the one hanging in the balance   is not going to be saved by a tube of tooth paste   he worked out of harvard  but not on toothpaste   he was a part of a classified us army experimental program called calvin genetics   they gave him the resources to do whatever work he wanted   which was primarily in an area called 'fringe science'   when you say 'fringe science'  you mean pseudo science   i suppose   things like mind control  teleportation  astral projection   invisibility  genetic mutation  re animation  fertility       whoa  excuse me for a second   re animation  really  so you're telling me  what   my father was dr  frankenstein   essex county  massachusetts  you know what  why don't you go on ahead   i think i'm gonna wait out in the lobby   dr  bishop  special day  you have a visitor   hello   i knew someone would have come  eventually   dr  bishop   this was     when did this happen   the incident on the plane happened four days ago   agent scott was injured the next day   aderm already indurated   translucent  muscular tissue   on scott  you mean can you see through his skin  yes   that's not good  to see through the skin  it's tricky  it's advanced       like that   what's happening to him  can it be reversed   what is it   they have this horrible pudding here   butterscotch pudding on mondays  it's dreadful   it's thursday   oh   that's fantastic news   it can be reversed  what happened to your colleague   years ago i worked with lab animals  some of them were afflicted  but were saved   so  do you remember what to do   this place  their choice of therapies has      dr  bishop   you came here today with my son   i'm not allowed visitors you see  except immediate family   unless the order has been lifted   and it's a simple 'if then' formula  if you are here  then so is he   i would so much   so very much like to see him   so much   he asked for you   thanks  sweetheart  i really appreciate that   hey  i didn't tell him you were here   call me sweetheart one more time  i really like that   hello  walter   i thought you'd be fatter   you thought i'd be fatter   excellent  first words  perfect   no  as a boy  you were round   yes  i was  until the summer before high school  not that i'd expect you to remember that   may i see something   what are you doing  take your hands off me   pupils are good  they're good   how advanced is your colleague's condition  would you some     i'm unable to deduce without a first hand examination   i must see mr  scott myself  which i am unable to do   under the present law  unless   signed out by a legal guardian  who must be once again a relative   what are you asking me to      no  guardian   no  forget it   he'll do it   no  i will not   one phone call  that's all it takes   you want me to make it  cause i've got my phone in my pocket   now it's out of my pocket   you wanted my father  now you've got my father   which falls into the category  be careful what you wish for  sweetheart    every effort is being made to understand what happened on flight 627    dr  bishop  i was curious  did anyone else ever have access to your work   well  the assistants have bits and pieces   god  i suppose   i suppose the only one who really knew what i was doing was billy   who   billy william bell  he and i shared a lab   william bell   you shared a lab with the founder of massive dynamics   i'm sorry  i don't know what that is md   ah  nothing really  just a tinny little company   that's perfect  one guy becomes the wealthiest man on planet   the other guy becomes an institutionalized sycophant   what   what happened   i just pissed myself   excellent   just a squirt   what do we do  what don't we do  massive dynamics  just got the message  how's john   worse   cdc says that hamburg flight was caused by synthetic compounds   which is like saying rain is caused by wet compounds   they've run some tests on john  but haven't come back with anything   what about bishop   left or right  insane  and irritating  and also my only hope   listen  i need to question william bell   could you set that up for me   william bell   massive dynamics william bell   he and bishop used to shared a lab   you kidding   dr  bishop   sent ginger ale  i need ginger ale   haven't had some long time  miss it   can you please get some ginger ale for the doctor  agent farnsworth   sure   whoa  stop right now  stop  does this not concern you   let him go   petrie dish  quick  please   but  i need to take this to my lab right away   your what   kreski building basement  harvard  we should leave  i have my sample   your lab was shut down after you left   i'm sorry   wake up  it's gone   no  no   no   walter  there is no lab   it's a perfect working     damn you   we need to get him back immediately   liaison  when did you get back   i need your help   i want you to know i've successfully had dr  walter bishop released from st  claire's  and he requires the use of his old laboratory   i'm sorry  what   kreski building  harvard  basement   it would be nice  to think that your tenacity in this case  is a byproduct of a remarkable and robust professionalism   but i can't help but wonder   if it wasn't something going on between you and agent scott   get the lab for bishop   so much  so much happened here   and so much is about to   harvard university  dr  bishop i've ordered a standard forensics' work package  is there anything else you need   optical coherence tomograpf for flesh study  two thousand pounds of silicon   at least five anonymous blood samples from volunteer donors   micro organism detector  nasa grade  of course  there's still nasa  yes   yes   oh  she's still here  this tank was the best   and a two years old bussaurus   a what   a cow   he wants a cow   purebred  not a crossbred  this is important   mature weight 850 pounds  total fat average 2 37   is he joking   genetically  humans and cows are separated by only a couple lines of dna   so  what's an ethical test subject   where'd you learn that  mit   no actually  i picked that up reading books  you should try it sometime  it's fun   get him the cow   fantastic  thank you   only thing better than a cow is a human  unless you need milk  then you really need a cow   coffee   thanks   tell me  what else did that file say  about yours truly   how bad was it   i'm not at liberty to discuss it   why don't you go ahead and liberate yourself  because i'm here now  so i kinnda feel i deserve the truth  don't you   there was no file   i needed you back here   so that was what  you were bluffing   i was desperate   yea  i'm usually pretty good at reading people  that's sorta what i do   yea  well i could see you were in trouble  anyone could see that   so i could have stayed   i could have stayed in iraq   you know  a car bomb went of this morning in kirkuk   you just might owe me a  thank you    yea  well  i owe a lot   yea  i figured  mafia   a guy named big eddie   i swear to you i'm not making that up   you owe money to a guy nick named big eddie   no  i owe money to a guy named big eddie   he had it legally changed  and the thing is i'm not even a gambler  i mean i never was  it's just      a couple of years ago i went a bit crazy   i thought you were a genius  you must have had a system   of course there was a system  the house was cheating  but you try telling them that   '72  during vietnam  dod's biochem division  had us working on a protoconteghian for a possible use against vietcong   it's possible that whatever affected that plane  may have been derived from that work   what about john   what's affecting him is merely a chemical reaction to raw laboratory ingredients   not the finished contagent  which means we can synthesize a counter agent   so you can help him   don't do that  don't give her false hope   it's not false   it's real  i could help  yes   if i had a precise inventory of what was in that storage facility when it detonated   we don't have it   it all went up  everything  and the suspect who might have those answers got away and john was the only one who saw his face   so how long does he have left   current rate of crystallization  cellular degradation      how long   24 hours   his brain will no longer be able to oxygenate itself   i'm so sorry  that i can't offer you a less dangerous solution   what do you mean   didn't i mention   whatever you think you said  you didn't say   synaptic transfer system  shared dream state   what do you mean 'shared dream state'   human brain generates a quantifiable electric field   i hypothesized in 1976  that it is possible  to synchronize the fields of two distinct minds   to allow the sharing of information across the unconscious state   like a string between two tin cans   you know what's great about that  that's completely insane   you're saying i can talk to john in coma   and he can tell me what the suspect looks like   it's not an exact science   it's not even science   have you done this before   i have used this technique to extract information from a corpse once   you can do that if they haven't been dead for longer than six hours   right  because after six hours that's when they are really dead   you could access his memories   assuming there's no brain damage  of course you'd have to have an electromagnetic probe  placed in the base of your skull  whilst immersed without clothing in the old tank   and you'd be heavily drugged   what sort of drugs   mix of ketamine  neuront   lysergic acid diethylamide   that last one is lsd  by the way  acid   it would take at least a few hours  i'd need your help to synthesize it  if it is not too much trouble   yea  sure  no problem  that sounds like fun   the man who was just released from a mental institution he wants to give you a drug overdose  and stick a metal rod into your head and put you naked into a rusty tank of water   no  i don't want to  no  i'd rather not  i'm just saying i can   ok  olivia  excuse me for a second  you're obviously under severe duress  and you haven't slept since iraq and the man you care about might die  but i'm telling you  that man will kill you   you don't understand the procedure   john would do it for me   set it up  i'll get dhs's authorization to bring john here   this is unbelievable  this is insane  he is insane and you're insane for following him   excellent  let's make some lsd   put him over here   salt will make you float   charlie  did you get me in to see william bell   massive dynamics isn't exactly being forthcoming and courteous   and apparently william bell is out of the country for the next two weeks   what's this   a sweet little memo from their general council   so bell doesn't want to talk   or he's just being the head of a 50 billion dollar corporation   screw this   i want to drive a tank through william bell's office and find out what he knows   i know you do  but i'm here to tell you the bad news   it's going to be another 48 hours till we get a court order   you should probably strip to your underwear   hello   what the hell was that   charlie  we don't have 24 hours  i need you to get to bell   if walter fails  bell could be the only one to save us   olivia  what's happening here  you've cleared all this with broyles   somewhat   somewhat doesn't sound good   is that a cow   yea  that's jean   listen charlie  i need you to promise me you'll do whatever you can   of course  you know that   hey  be careful   my god   now  where was i  could you tilt your head forward  please   i still think that this is deeply irresponsible and believe me  i would know   this is an anesthetic   if you feel normal it's working   yea  because bootleg and smack in a basement is just a picture of normalcy   i've got you   i hope your guy is worth it   a vital stats spike will pull you out   you'll start to feel very relaxed pretty soon   and this will rip open your consciousness   listen  in case you don't come back   i just want to say before we do this   how much i appreciate what you've done   there is so many things you loose in a place like that   you loose being trusted   strange how important that is when it's gone    watch your hands  heavy doors  save your fingers  close with care    if you want to watch  you can come closer  you work here   yea  i'm astrid farnsworth  assistant to agent dunham   who   oh  yes  i'm walter      bishop  walter bishop   yes  thank you   don't mention it   these are her brain rhythms   more important than most people know regarding cerebral regional interaction  critical   and these are his   as the drugs take effect the probes will synchronize the electrical signals from both   that what the brain is  an electrical router   should be able to be interpreted by the other   simple really  like making toffee   and when the rhythms are in sync  they should be in the same place  so to speak   so what do we do now   now we wait   what was that   should be any minute now   hello   i think i'm here  i'm here   look  almost in sync   john   i know this   that's my uncle's kayak  why is it here   john  is that you   olivia   john   what's happening   she's fine   she's alright   she's fine   you're sure   look  they're together   i was just thinking about you   what was that   nothing   john  you were hurt   i don't remember   think   the storage units   i feel cold   i need you to remember   remember what   what you saw  i need you to show me his face   why   so i can save you  please try   try and remember   yes  this is right    we've got a runner in the back  we need him alive    i can't see his face   you're late   i saw him  i saw john get hurt  i was there  i swear   what do you mean you saw him  where   i told you not to ask me that   this is him  this is the suspect we are looking for  he looks like this   send me the image  i'll put it through the database   have you slept   you look like crap   no primary matches for criminal record   cross check all state driver's license files and send this image to all local hospitals   agent dunham  take a look at this   oh my god  this is him   he was a passenger on the flight 627   i don't understand   wait  he couldn't been in the storage place   charlie  i saw him   hold on guys  morgan steig was passenger 108   his emergency contact  richard steig   you're telling me he has a twin   yeah  no home address  only history of employment   what   richard steig's last employer   i was hoping to speak with william bell   i'm nina sharp  executive director   i only have a few minutes   our primary suspect is a former employee of yours  richard steig   who may have used research from your company to develop a self eradicating airborne toxin   we don't know why or for whom  but it appears he was willing to sacrifice his own brother   whatever killed those people on that plane got onboard through his insulin pad   so  do you want to talk to me   danielle  please assemble everything we have on richard steig for agent dunham here   i remember richard steig  he worked in our weapons system research lab   he was caught three months ago trying to leave the premises with classified information   he was terminated immediately  we referred his name to the justice department   we have done our do diligence  agent dunham   and  if you choose to drag our company and dr  bell's name into this matter   you will be hearing from our attorneys   how long have you worked for dr  bell   16 years   i owe massive dynamics my life and that is not an exaggeration   i was a runner most of my life   in the '97 boston marathon i felt strangely tired   one day at the office dr  bell noticed my discomfort and insisted i go for a cat scan   cancer   spread so severely i had to have my arm amputated that week   that first scanner that found my cancer was built by this company   the robotic assist tools that were used at my surgery  the drugs i used afterwards   were developed and manufactured by massive dynamics   and my replacement limb was designed by bell himself   everything we have on richard steig   do you believe that steig may be part of the  pattern    i'm sorry  part of the  pattern    i assumed you had clearance   i'm cleared to know whatever you're cleared to know  miss sharp   apparently not   but suffice to say that we reached the point where science and technology  have advanced at such an exponential rate for so long   it may be way beyond our ability to regulate and control them   you should know what you're getting into  agent dunham   i would say this to my own daughter    be careful and good luck    and this is a show for children   yea  it's huge   surprisingly profound for a narrative about a sponge   crazy house   i just landed at logan  i'm on my way to you  i think we located our suspect   hold on a second  you found the guy  you found the guy from your dreams   i'm picking you both up   i need your father there to question  get whatever information he needs so he can make a cure for john and i need you there too  in case your father is     say no more  we'll meet you out front    stake out is on  you're outside     stand by     confirm your position     two minutes out        perimeter two miles back     everybody where are you at     coming out     this way  mam     stand aside     fbi     clear     clear     clear    i'd like to check your blood pressure   why don't you check your own blood pressure  mine is fine  thanks   your skin tone suggest you might be suffering from arterial hypertension   don't tell me what i'm suffering from   and there are no visible signs of hypertension   when this is over  please don't send me back   i don't want to go back   look  walter   this experience   it woke me up again and you can't put me back to sleep   it was hardly my idea  any of it   whatever punishment you think i deserve   i swear i have already endured it    hey   what   hey  he's in the alley   can i get out of the car   stay right there walter   no  fuck   i've got some questions for you   it was a magnesium based ethylene glycol   i understand that  but you're not listening   magnesium ethylene glycol with organophosphate trigger   look  pop  just stop for a second   his blood won't be able to absorb it before the side effects kill him   and you're saying what   we synthesize a calcium gluconate lanthanum base   yes  exactly   we can't we'd need more of his blood  we have none   that's not true  all agents are required to set up a backup blood supply in case we are wounded   cowardless transfusion  that's brilliant   we can create the antidote and then just dissolve it in stored blood   if we transfuse him intravenously  his body won't be overwhelmed   a  boy  well done  let's begin   so  i got the lab   yea  i know you did   thanks   how's it going downstairs   bishop says that's going to be a while  but that it looks auspicious   that was his word  what   you've done some solid work  locating bishop   getting him out  finding a way to get him to work with you  we're impressed   it was his son who found a way to get him to work  not me  brains run in the family   who is we   what happened on that plane might be part of something more dangerous than simple terrorism   simple terrorism   in the past nine months there had been three dozen authenticated incidents like the hamburg flight   most of what i'm about to show you has not been made public   john thompson  normal kid  went missing back in '98   reappeared last month half way around the world  hadn't aged a day   in the past few months 46 other children that went missing that same year turn up  sam story   local fishermen off the coast of sri lanka   reports a low flying plane emitting a high pitched frequency that blows out all their windows   an hour later  same spot  creates a tsunami that kills 38 000 people   so why are you telling me this   this man  a patient in lisbon who woke up after years in a coma   began writing  just numbers   they turn out to be exact real time coordinates of our carrier battle groups in the pacific   intel that's classified above top secret   so how is that even possible   come work for me and i'll get you the clearance     stop   dunham  there is more you need to hear   you must not have heard me  i said stop   they're calling these events  the pattern    as if someone out there is experimenting  only the whole world is their lab   you've seen it now you know   i don't want to know  i have a job   this is more important job   anything  anybody you need you can have   i like the job i've got  and the man i do it with  which you seem have deduced on your own   look around  you see all these people going about their lives   no idea what's happening around them and what they're in the middle of   i just want to go back to before   dunham  i don't think you can   he's up  he's awake  olivia  he's awake  he's conscious   john   john  can you hear me baby  baby   i had a dream about you   hi  change of clothes for agent scott   his vitals are surprisingly strong   so  how long does he have to stay   until the melanoma sites in his skin are regenerated  but that shouldn't be more than a week   he owes you his life   we owe each other   what room is steig in   i told you everything i know  didn't i   and i gave you the names of all the synthetics i used in the compound   don't worry  our immunity agreement still holds   but there's still a whole lot more we have to talk about  like why you killed your brother   and who you're selling your work to   who said i was selling it   i was threatened by a guy from your office  you think i'm lying   i swear to god  i can prove it   where's the recording   i buried it    i will come after you   threatening me     after seeing what i'm willing to do to my own brother   let me assure you we'd be happy to treat you as family too     let me assure you we'd be happy to treat you as family too    special agent scott   yes  sir  go in   thanks   charlie  i need two agents posted outside agent scott's room  check on steig   i'm on it   i'm 5 minutes away   we need this place locked down   this is dunham  agent id 5 2 7 7 6   in pursuit of blue suv  heading south on tramway  need immediate assist   ask yourself  why      why broyles sent you   to storage facility   why you   i don't understand   who are you working for   john  tell me  tell me more  john   i know him just as long as you did   i'm sorry   job isn't what it was ten years ago   we're supposed to protect the world   where one breath of the wrong air can incinerate you from the inside our   i mean  how do we protect people   when corporations have higher security clearances than we do   when we're not fully briefed on half the things we're investigating   you know  when the truth   the truth is   we're obsolete   take me back to the lab   can i talk to you please   yea  i'll be back in a second   i'm sure you're anxious to get as far away from here as possible   to iraq or afghanistan  or some other out of reach places   but i'm here to tell you that your father needs to stay  which means that you need to to   are you ok   i don't know  i know you have countless reasons  as to why this is a non starter to you   but your father is a good man   he's not the monster you think he is and you're good with him despite what you think   and you're the only one who speaks walter   you take him back to st  claire's it's all over   where's john   i can talk to the agency and get them to clear your gambling debt   i can take care of my own debts  ok   what just happened   where's john   i'm not gonna use false threats with you anymore  i don't need to   the threats are real   after you left my father sat down  started talking to me and he was remarkably lucid   he told me about the work that he and william bell have done in their experiments and that experiment  what happened on that plane is just the beginning   which makes every part of me feel like i gotta get the hell out of boston   are we leaving   how long has he been dead   five hours   question him   listen to   thin lizzy
