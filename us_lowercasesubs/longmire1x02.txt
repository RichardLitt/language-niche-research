note for us   we think it's pennsylvania dutch  yeah  sure   good to know  uh     we're gonna need to talk to your parents  okay   they're in the mennonite colony in ashlan   it's a few miles from here   i know where it is   why don't you come with me to talk to them   i i can't   i'm sorry  but i i can't go home     unless it's for good   i i i'm not allowed to see or talk to my parents   t that's    it's    it's how rumspringa works   i understand   i don't want to upset tradition   just an address will do   the kid needs to know what happened to his sister   parents deserve to hear it first   i'll radio back after i talk to them   you can tell him then   in the meantime  impound the puce car  so we can have it checked for prints   you can catch a ride with the tow truck   find out

 i know that you have all been shown this photo tonight   so  this show is over     until i get a name  boys   come on  boys   it's just one little name   davis   what's his first name   that is his first name   then what's his last name   turner   pay up  bitch   honey     i always do   yeah  mm hmm   let's go   hello  mrs  clausen  i'm sheriff longmire   would you mind if i came in   i'm sorry  i    rachel   it's not fitting for her to talk with strange men   mr  clausen  i'm sorry   i i didn't mean to offend you or your wife   i i was hoping we could talk about your daughter  hannah   she's not here   i know  i spoke to your son  samuel   he explained   have you spoken to him or to hannah since they left   no   heard any news about them from friends or neighbors   no   mr  clausen  i don't mean to annoy you with these questions   why do you continue to ask them  then   'cause i'm afraid i have some bad news   your daughter  hannah     i'm sorry to say your daughter's   dead   she was lost to me long ago   do you not have people for that   you want something done right  you do it yourself   ruby said you had not eaten   so  you think the dead girl was in this car   who else are you expecting to find   no idea   you have any dealings with a     ephraim clausen   no  why do you ask   well  i went out there today     told him that his daughter was dead   and no reaction   i don't know much about being a mennonite   but i know about being a dad  and i'd be     well  i'd be something   every culture processes grief in its own way   have you  uh    you heard that cady's seeing someone   what   it has been like three years since she dated anyone   who is it   oh  okay  so she hasn't told you either  huh   you see  this is why i do not have kids   they make you crazy   you know  she might tell you   for some reason  she likes you   the reason she likes me is i do not pry  into parts of her life that are not my business   besides  you might be better off not knowing   good news     while we were in oden  we caught a huge break in the case   found your coat   we  um  also got a name off the photo booth pictures   davis turner   how'd you manage that   let's just say there was a pole involved   davis has a record   he's got three outstanding warrants for assault   sounds like a man we should talk to   the only problem is no one can find him   i just got off the phone with his bosses   he just started a four day shift  driving a truck for farion energy   i'll find him   walt  walt  cyrus brooks is here   he said you called him about his car   when i ran the registration   i was surprised to see your name pop up   how is it your car ends up with a bunch of mennonite kids   well  truth is  i gave it to them  sheriff   it was my old car  i thought they could use it   and there's not a whole host of people  lining up to help those kids   but i don't suppose we can leave it at that   well    seeing is believing   cyrus  i bought nails from you for 10 years   i never had you figured for mennonite   i'm not  i left when i was 17   had 21 bucks in my pocket and the clothes on my back   i've been in their shoes   when they get out here   i give them some direction and help them find some work   cheap place to live   and  yes  a car   why'd you impound it  by the way   one of the residents  um  hannah clausen     she was found dead a few nights ago   what   wait  hannah   my god  wh   um     what happened   we're still piecing that together  so     there anything you can tell me about hannah   well  i can tell you that her job wasn't the safest   um     she was a dancer   an exotic dancer   you saying she was a stripper   she didn't want anyone at the house knowing   so she asked me to drive her to the club   i probably should have said no  huh   you can still help her  cyrus   you can help me find the person that did this   any chance you'd be able to translate that for me    he who is not with me is against me    it's a bible quote   matthew  if i'm not mistaken   what about the drawing  mean anything to you   yeah  it looks familiar   sort of like the cottonwood you see along the dark road   sorry   dark road    it's the road that leads straight out of ashlan   when you go on rumspringa  you have to walk down that road   longest half mile of my life   it's also the road where some of the parents  secretly meet their kids at night   isn't that against the rules   yeah   but eternal damnation is a small price to pay  to know what's going on with your kids   most kids leave for good   actually  no   most of them go back home   girls more so than boys   what was hannah planning to do   she never said   but i got the impression she was never going back there   no  she had bigger plans   texted one of my friends at farion energy   explained the situation with davis   managed to have his shift changed   if we leave for oden now   we could probably catch him at home   not you  vic   need you to go through those fingerprints   see if you can't compile a list of who was in that car   are you serious   i think oden's seen enough of you today   this is pretty standard boilerplate stuff   nothing really worthy of me rushing over here for   sorry  i am always suspicious  when your people ask me to sign legal documents   so  cady  you seeing anyone new   did my dad put you up to this   no  come on   i am just curious   promise not to tell my dad   i promise  but why all the secrecy   it's just  well     you know there's not a lot of guys in durant   you know  not a very deep bench   so the guy that i'm seeing  he's a little older   how much older   about 120 years   he's a vampire  and he's amazing   okay  o okay   you should really meet him  henry   no  oh  but it would have to be at night   you have made your point   this is davis' trailer   sheriff's department   oh   you should always stand to the side of the door   no  no  no  no  there     there's got to be some kind of mistake   that    that can't be   i dropped hannah off at home two nights ago before my shift   she was fine   two nights ago   that makes you the last person to see her alive   and guess where that puts you on the suspect list   whoa  whoa  h hold up  i i didn't do anything   listen  i i loved her   every dime we made  we put aside to move away together   why would i throw away something like that   she     hannah was my soul mate   she was a stripper  they're paid to like you   no  she wasn't like that  all right    where is hannah    you're lying  where is she    you got a temper  davis   hannah ever see this side of you   you don't know shit about me   you can ask anyone  all i ever did was protect her   there are plenty of jagoffs where she worked  that would hassle her  but i always put them in line   any particular jagoff come to mind   i don't know   two nights ago  she was arguing with this dude   had you ever seen him before   you got off early tonight   why didn't you go to the club after your shift   tonight's her night off   she liked to spend those with her family   you ever meet her family   no   she was never really keen on the idea   fact that they're mennonites might have something to do with that   menno what  mennonites   they're like the amish   amish   she never said nothing about being amish   why wouldn't she tell me something like that   i mean  i i knew she grew up in a religious house   hell  i've heard her quote chapter and verse by heart   amish     ruby  uh huh   pen    please   thank you   what   my bible   yeah   keep davis locked up for his warrants  till we get this settled   also  pull hannah's bank records   make sure she really was saving her money   where the hell do you think you're going   ashlan   why   the bible quote from the note was code   matthew    chapter 12  verse 30   it's a meeting time   hannah was supposed to meet someone  on the dark road at 12 30   how do you know it's tonight   i don't   davis says it's her night off   worth a shot   mrs  clausen   uh   excuse me   what are you doing out here  mrs  clausen   i was supposed to meet my daughter  hannah   why are you here   did your husband tell you about our conversation   he only said that hannah wasn't coming home   thank goodness   i told her to leave   when  uh     when i was her age   i didn't know there was any other choice   it's a comfort to know  she won't make the same mistakes i made   where did you get that   why were you writing to your daughter in code   in case the note was intercepted   ephraim would have been upset   i don't understand why you have it   how'd you manage to get it to her   a man in town whom we trust     cyrus brooks   i i gave it to him in his shop   and he passed it along to her   now     please tell me why you have that note   i'm afraid there was an incident   hannah was found dead two days ago   i shouldn't have told her to go   why   i shouldn't have told her to go   ephraim clausen never told his wife about hannah's death   you  uh     you want to bring him in   not yet   first i want to get cyrus in for another chat   apparently he's been passing notes between hannah and her mother  and didn't think to mention it   if you think that's weird   hannah was saving her money   she had  16 000 stashed in a joint savings account   a joint account  with davis   with cyrus   cyrus said hannah had big plans   maybe those plans involved him   if he got wind she was leaving with davis   he could have gotten upset  confronted her at work   any of those prints belong to cyrus  vic   for a guy who says he gave his car away   he sure as hell drives it a lot   let's bring him in   mind explaining why you have  a joint bank account with the victim   hannah's parents didn't want to get her  a social security number   the bank wouldn't open an account without one  so i helped   you do this for all the kids or just the pretty ones   i never touched her   and if you look at the statement   you'll see i never touched a penny she made  either   why didn't you tell me about the note   i translated it  didn't i   you didn't tell me who it was from   how was i supposed to know that   you passed the note to hannah   i gave hannah a plain envelope   i had no idea what was inside   i didn't consider it any of my business   thanks   clears up a lot   i need you to look at someone before you go   i don't know him   is he the one who killed hannah   i can't comment on an ongoing investigation   is that all you're gonna ask him   what about his relationship with hannah   davis  is that the man  you saw hannah fighting with at the club   no  i never seen him before   here   make sure you're positive   sorry  it wasn't him   look again   wait   what if i recognize someone else   excuse me   it is a beautiful day at the red pony  and continual soiree     this is henry    hey  henry   got a young kid in there who looks like opie   looks like he just ordered a beer  he with anyone   no   do me a favor  don't serve him   why  is he the guy dating cady   if you need a reason  he's underage   samuel   if i remember correctly  you dot have a license   sheriff  i  uh     there was no one at the house to drive me   and i i just    i needed to  uh    relax  son   i understand you've had a lot going on lately   i'll let it slide this time   thank you   but i can't let
