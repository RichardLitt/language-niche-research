salvatore   ms  gilbert   stefan  i brought it   told you   wuthering heights by ellis bell   you know  i can't believe she didn't use her real name   all the bronte sisters used pseudonyms   it was the time   female writers weren't very accepted then   where did you get it   uh  it was passed down   through the family   ah   i have lots of books  go ahead  keep it   oh  no  i    but i would like to read it again   i promise i'll give it back   ok   i'm confused   are you psychic or clairvoyant   technically  grams says i'm a witch   my ancestors were these really cool  salem witch chicks or something   grams tried to explain it all   but she was looped on the liquor  so i kinda tuned out  crazy family  yes   witches  i don't think so   yeah  well  feel free to conjure up the name and number  of that guy from last night   i didn't see him  you did   why didn't you just talk to him   i don't know  i was drunk     i never know how to treat you      you say i love you but it ain't true      i like to grab you by the hair    hey  tyler   hey  i'm sorry to interrupt   i was just wondering how vickie's doing   since you guys are so close   is she ok   she's fine  now get out of here   how bad is she   do they know what attacked her   is she going to make a full recovery   was she happy to see you  what room number was she in   i'm going to kick your ass   yeah  you keep saying that   but when are you actually going to do it   huh  'cause i vote for right here and right now     i like to grab you by the hair    walk away  gilbert   it's your final warning   no  this is your final warning  dick   i'm sick of watching you play vickie   you hurt herne more time  i swear to god  i will kill you     i like to grab you by the hair    damn  that was like a death threat   did you hear that   they're keeping her overnight to make sure  there's no infection   but she should be able to come home tomorrow   that's good news  yeah   did you get in touch with your mom   called and left a message   she's in virginia beach with her boyfriend   so   we'll see how long it takes her to come rushing home   vickie's lucky that she's ok   i know  and now there's talk of some missing campers   did she say what kind of animal it was that attacked her   she said it was a vampire   what   yeah  she wakes up last night and mutters  vampire   and then passes out   ok  that is weird   i think she was drunk   so what's up with you and the new guy   matt  the last thing that i want to do is hurt you   you know  i'm    i'm actually gonna go back to the hospital   i want to be there when vickie wakes up   get the real story about last night   ok   as jeremy's teacher  i'm concerned   all right  it's the third day of school  and he's skipped 6 of his classes   mr  tanner   are you aware that jeremy and elena's parents died    car accident   wickery bridge  if i remember correctly   and you're related to the family how   the  uh  mother's kid sister   younger sister   right  yes    i mean  that's kind of hard to do   not when you're on drugs   it's his attempt at coping  ms  summers   and the signs are there   he's moody  withdrawn  argumentative   hungover   are there any other relatives in the picture   i'm their sole guardian   uh huh   could there be   what are you suggesting  exactly   it's an impossible job  isn't it   raising two teens   it's been tough   but  no  it's not   wrong answer   it is an extremely impossible job   and anything less and you're not doing it properly   whoa   vick   vickie  hey   vick  it's matt  hey  what's wrong   no  no   get off   no   no   no   it was an animal that attacked you   it came out of the night and jumped you   you blacked out   it's all you remember  it's all i remember   an animal attacked you  you blacked out   it's all you remember  it's all i remember   nurse  i need help   it's my sister   she seems fine   bonnie  well  i was talking to grams   and she said the comet is a sign of impending doom   the last time it passed over mystic falls   there was lots of death  so much blood and carnage   it created a bed of paranormal activity   yeah  and then you poured grams another shot  and she told you about the aliens   so then what   so then nothing   you and stefan talked all night   there was no sloppy first kiss or touchy feely of any kind   nope   we didn't go there   not even a handshake   i mean  elena   we are your friends   ok  you are supposed to share the smut   we just talked for hours   ok  what is with the blockage   just jump his bones already  ok  it's easy   boy likes girl  girl likes boy   sex   profound     ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh    where are you going   caroline's right  it is easy   if i sit here long enough   i'll end up talking myself out of it  instead of doing what i started the day saying i was going to do     i trust you    i picked up dinner  tacos   i had an urge for guacamole   no  i'm good  thanks   eat anyway  it's a ruse   i want to talk   hey  you  come   sit   back in school  freshman year   i could eat my weight in nachos   with extra cheese   it was my munchie food whenever i got stoned   you get high   did   past tense   but  yeah  loved it   anything to get a little distraction  from life    reality   and it worked   for a while   never lasts  though   hey  i'm not saying i wouldn't love to rail back and kick it   but with a thesis looming  and a waistline expanding     what the    finally you're awake   hey  how are you feeling   you look better   i was worried before   you really had me freaked out with all that screaming   wait  what are you talking about   you don't remember   i feel fine   good  good   doctor said you could come home tomorrow   vick  what attacked you in the woods   an animal   what else could it have been   hey  how do you feel   i'm ok   i  i'm gonna    i'm gonna go grab a coffee   hey  jer   why are you here   i just wanted to see how you were doing   did you see that look on matt's face   that was suspicion  i don't want people  to find out about us  jeremy   well  you gotta get over that   tyler is finally showing some interest   you have to get over that  too   do you see mr  concerned   tyler  are you under there   no   it's not cool for people to know   ok  i'm older than you   and matt and elena would freak   no one's going to suspect anything   why wouldn't i check on you   i mean  i'm the one who found you   you are   yeah  i carried you out of the woods   thank you   yeah  you're welcome   stefan   stefan   i  i'm sorry for barging in  the door was

your living room   living room  parlor  sotheby's auction   it's a little kitschy for my taste   i see why my brother's so smitten   it's about time  for a while there   i never thought he'd get over the last one   nearly destroyed him   the last one   yeah   katherine  his girlfriend   oh  you two haven't had the awkward exes conversation yet   nope   oops  well  i'm sure it'll come up now   or maybe he didn't want to tell you  because he didn't want you to think he was on the rebound   we all know how those relationships end   you say it like  every relationship is doomed to end   i'm a fatalist   hello  stefan   elena   i didn't know you were coming over   i know  i should have called  i just    oh  don't be silly  you're welcome any time   isn't she  stefan   you know  i should break out the family photo albums   or some home movies   but   i have to warn you   he wasn't always such a looker   thank you for stopping by  elena   nice to see you   yeah  i should probably go   it was nice to meet you  damon   great meeting you  too  elena   stefan   stefan   great gal   whoo  she's got spunk   you  on the other hand  look pooped   did you over exert yourself today   let me guess   hospital   someone had to clean up your mess   well  were you successful   did the powers of persuasion work   remember  if you don't feed properly   none of those little tricks work right   how long was elena here   were you worried  stefan   scared we may be doomed  to repeat the past   isn't that why you play your little game   i'm a high school human    i'm not playing any game  of course you are   we both know  the closest you'll ever get to humanity  is when you rip it open and feed on it   what kind of game are you playing     damien   guess you'll just have to wait and see  won't you   elena  he's on the rebound and has raging family issues   well  at least it's an ex girlfriend   wait till you date a guy with mommy issues  or cheating issues   or amphetamine issues   jeremy   jeremy  where were you   more stoner stories   look  jenna  i get it  you were cool   and so that's   that's cool   oh  no  no  no   ow  why   why  why did you do that  listen up   quit ditching class or you're grounded   no discussion   parental authority  i like it   sleep tight     and i'm an animal      you're an animal  too    matt   mattie   tonight  night of the comet   would you like a program   he didn't call  huh   or text   but i realized we never even exchanged that stuff   we've never gotten to the texting part   that's an important milestone in any relationship   isn't it  the timing is wrong  anyway   when is it ever right   i'm not ready  bonnie   who is   at least i put myself out there   is that what you're calling it   what do you mean   all i'm hearing is reasons why you can't        get back down to street level      i get around      here i come when i better go      i say yes when i ought to say no      here i come when i better go      i say yes

 this girl in the hospital could talk   she won't   i took care of her   you're sure   i'm not sure  zach   i don't know how well it worked   i'm not as strong as damon   so what happens if it doesn't work   i don't know   i'll deal with it   is she worth it   uncle stefan  this girl you came back for   vickie  what are you doing here   fighting with robert about my schedule   you'd think getting ripped up by a rabid animal  would merit an extra sick day  are you feeling ok   i hurt   well  the doctor gave you something  right   the kid stuff   nothing with an  o  in it   i think they were onto me   here  knock yourself out  literally   thanks  jer   so you gonna  uh  watch the comet later   i hadn't really thought about it   but i could be talked into it   i'll meet you out there in a

that comet     it's been traveling across space for thousands of years   all alone   yeah  bonnie says it's a harbinger of evil   i think it's just a ball of     snow and ice   trapped on a path that it can't escape   and once every 145 years   it gets to come home   i'm sorry about yesterday   i wasn't myself   you seem to spend a lot of time apologizing   well  i have a lot to apologize for   yesterday  that wasn't about you  ok   you didn't tell me that you had a brother   we're not close   it's  uh     it's complicated   always   he told me about your ex  catherine   what did he say   that she broke your heart   that was a long time ago   when you lose someone  it stays with you   always reminding you of how easy it is to get hurt   elena     it's ok  stefan   i get it   you have no idea how much i get it   complicated brother  check   complicated ex  check   too complicated to even contemplate dating  double check   it's ok   we met  and we talked   and it was epic  but     then the sun came up and reality set in  so     i know you   well  that's unfortunate   um     i don't  i don't know how   but     your face   excuse me  sorry   hey  has anyone seen vickie   you're her stalker  you tell us   i can't find her   she probably found somebody else to party with   sorry  pill pusher  i guess you've been replaced   what's with the pill pusher   ask him  you wanna do this right now   are you dealing   she's never gonna go for you   she already did   over and over and over again   yeah  right   you slept with vickie donovan   i mean  vickie donovan slept with you

help me find my sister  we'll check the back   i'll check the square  i'll come with you   oh  no  no  no   you are coming with me   so that's your game now  dealing   i'm not dealing  look  i'm sick  of the tough love speech  jer  it's really having no impact   you and jenna  between the two of you    we can stop if you want   send you to a therapist where you'll be forced to deal with it  or to rehab where you'll sit in group  and tell some stranger how you let your life fall apart   or you could talk to me   i vote for none of the above   hey   hey   have you seen my sister   no  sorry  i can't find her   she's missing   i'll keep an eye out for her   hey   i saw you at the hospital yesterday   did you   what were you doing there   visiting   visiting   you know   elena and i  we've

murderous monster   please  damon  please don't do this   if you couldn't fix it before   i don't know what you can do now   aah   uhh   your choice of lifestyle  has made you weak   a couple of vampire parlor tricks  is nothing compared to the power that you cod have   that you now need   but yocan change that ge  human blood gives you that   no   you have two choices   you can feed and make her forget   or you can let her run  screaming  vampire  through the town square   that's what this is about   you want to expose me   no  i want you to remember who you are   why  so what  so i'll feed   so i'll kill   so i'll remember what it's like to be brothers again   you know what  let her go   let her tell everyone that vampires  have returned to mystic falls   let them chain me up   and let them drive a stake through my heart   because at least i'll be free of you   huh   huh   wow   come here  sweetheart   no  it's ok   what happened   where am i   oh  i ripped my stitches open   ah

always brings me back to you    would you like to come in     you never take       the comet's actually this way     no matter what i say or do      still feel you here      till the moment i'm gone    elena  sorry for barging in   especially after earlier   no  no  i'm glad you're here   the way we left things    i didn't like it   see  the thing is   i got home tonight planning on doing what i always do   write in my diary   like i have been since my mom gave me one when i was 10   it's where i get everything out  everything i'm feeling   it all goes in this little book  that i hide on the second shelf  behind this really hideous ceramic mermaid   but then i realized that i'd just be writing things  that i should probably be telling you   what would you write   i would write      dear diary    today i convinced myself it was ok to give up    don't take risks    stick with the status quo    no drama  now is just not the time    but my reasons aren't reasons  they're excuses    all i'm doing is hiding from the truth   and the truth is that        set me free    i'm scared  stefan   i'm scared that if i let myself  be happy for even one moment that     the world's just going to come crashing down   and i    i don't know if i can survive that     so talk    do you want to know what i would write     but you're onto me     i met a girl    we talked   it was epic      i live here on my knees     but then the sun came up and reality set in      everything i think need here on the        well  this is reality   right here     i can't seem to let you go      the one thing that i still know      is that you're keeping me      down      ooh      you're keeping me down      yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah      you're onto me      onto me     all over    aah   sync by honeybunny
