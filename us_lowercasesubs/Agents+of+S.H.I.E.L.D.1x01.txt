something impossible just happened   what are you going to do about it     agent ward  there's been a development   it's the rising tide   they've pinned down the location of the package   we need to abort   i'm five minutes away from retrieving it   so is everyone else   they posted the coordinates online   if the job was easy    yeah  it wouldn't be any fun   watch your six       red tie  by the window               your fireplace is broken             dumont  ward  just a heads up   we've got possible hostiles in your vicinity   really         hill  what does  s h i e l d   stand for  agent ward   strategic homeland intervention  enforcement  and logistics division   and what does that mean to you   it means someone really wanted our initials  to spell out  shield    it means we're the line     between the world and the much weirder world   we protect people from news they aren't ready to hear   and when we can't do that  we keep them safe   something turns up     like this chitauri neural link     we get to it before someone bad does   any idea who vanchat was planning to sell it to   i'm more interested in how this rising tide group  found out about it   i thought they were just hackers   what changed   everything's changing   a little while ago  most people went to bed  thinking that the craziest thing in the world  was a billionaire in a flying metal suit   then aliens invaded new york and were beaten back  by  among others  a giant green monster   a costumed hero from the '40s  and a god   i don't think thor's technically a god   well  you haven't been near his arms   the battle of new york was the end of the world   this    now    is the new world   people are different   they have access to tech  to formulas   secrets they're not ready for   why was i pulled out of paris   that  you'll have to ask agent coulson   uh  yeah  i'm clearance level six   i know that    agent coulson was killed in action  before the battle of new york   got the full report   welcome to level seven   sorry    that corner was really dark   and i couldn't help myself   i think there's a bulb out     director fury faked your death     to motivate the avengers   hill  well  the death of a common ally  is a particularly effective team builder   female voice  say  cheese    plus  it wasn't that much of a stretch   i stopped breathing for about 40 seconds   eight  it gets longer every time you tell it   yeah  well  you get shanked by the asgardian mussolini   you can tell it your way   i was looking at the big white light   and it felt like a lot longer than eight seconds   do they know   the avengers    that fury played them   they're not level seven   i got out of the i c u    fury stuck me in a grass shack in tahiti   rough gig   mai tais  travis mcgee novels  and a physical therapist  whose command of english was    irrelevant   but something put you back in the game   what is that   that's a superhero  agent ward   an unregistered gifted  identity    unknown   skye  the secret's out   for decades  your organization      man  on may 2nd  an unidentified object     another little present from the rising tide   how are they getting this stuff before us   same way they cracked our rsa implementation   they're good   so i need better   hill  agent coulson has requisitioned  a mobile command unit  to which you are assigned   rising tide is trying to draw us out   i think it's time they succeeded   you want me to cross them off   wow  no   i want to use them to get to him   this man's world is about to get very weird   he's gonna need some help   i'm sorry   i was trained from day one as a specialist   i go in alone  i get it done   defusing a nuclear bomb    i'm your guy   a welcoming committee    not my speed   i know it's not what you want   agent hill did a very detailed assessment  of your last three missions   combat    top grades   espionage     she gave you the highest marks since romanoff   under  people skills   she drew a     i think it's a little poop  with knives sticking out of it   what  it     that's bad  right   and given your family history   i'm surprised it's not worse   but     i think you're the guy for this   dr  streiten  we're meeting now   if i'm wrong  you go straight back to your bombs   team's approved  physicals are all fine   fitz simmons is not cleared for combat   i'm told that won't be an issue   agent ward here    he's almost too fit   that's an issue  that should be an issue   maybe i can't join the team  god  are you dismissed  because my       it was a porcupine  it was not a poop   it just means that he     no  i'm pretty sure   and it's not just ward  your whole roster is sketchy   well  they're cleared   i would have been very happy not to clear you  phil   i'd love for you to rest up some more   i've had plenty of that  thanks   you sure   you should go sometime   where   tahiti   it's a magical place     three days in  i'd be begging for an assignment   exactly     tahiti     he really doesn't know  does he   he can never know   i is there any way i can thank him    are you sure nobody saw him    male reporter  so  the identity of the hooded hero  still remains unknown   female reporter  researchers at ucla medical center  released a study today which shows that supplemental     just act natural   what   just pretend that we're talking   we are   good   'cause you never know who's listening   i don't even know who's talking   i'm skye   and you're the hooded hero     please tell me that you're not staying with that name   wait  what  i'm not    i'm a factory worker     sure  by day   i saw you  you're a hero   like  a for real superhero  which is     i'm not  like  a groupie  stalker type  but       oh  my god  that is so cool   okay  okay  chill   just don't    don't draw attention     you're in danger   you got the wrong guy  lady   no  you've got the wrong approach   the cute girl from the hospital is dying to thank you     and possibly  thank  you      and you're hiding   the clip of you rescuing her has had the most hits  since that puppy with vertigo   and you can't even find a job   what do you mean about danger   s h i e l d   shield  what  i should carry a shield   s h i e l d  government   scary men in dark suits who come after guys like you   they knew about the battle of new york  before it even happened  and then cleaned it up  before anyone could ask any real questions    overnight   how long do you think it'll take for them to clean you up   and you want to know why i'm hiding   what if you didn't hide   what if you got in front of this  and let people know that you're a hero   i'm just a guy   well  a guy like that gets work  gets perks   i can help   i'm great with computers    like  weirdly great   i mean  i could help you create a whole new identity or       a mask   o kay  uh  ok     well  you could just    also  we could just stick with the         hood   listen  you cannot walk away from this   with great power comes     a ton of weird crap that you are not prepared to deal with   now  my office is     you have an office   yes  i have an office   it's a mobile    office   it's a    van  i live in a van    by choice   but it's always in the alley around the corner     free wi fi    and you can come by anytime   thank you   they're coming for you   mike   coulson  agent may   no   so you've been briefed   i'm not going back in the field   yeah   you've got such a nice setup here   you ever thought about adding a moat   i just need you to drive the bus   liaise ground transpo  some on site supervision   this isn't a combat op   then you don't need me     i do   'cause we'll be running ourselves   picking the ops     making the calls   no red tape   this is where they actually make the red tape  isn't it   i always wondered   melinda   you're really just asking me to drive the bus   i'm not asking   but it's a really nice bus     man  you need to know   man 2  yeah  asap  please     man 3  that's gonna be on a secondary  man 4  yeah  got it    whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  watch it   that's the night night gun    well  it's on my stuff  and it doesn't work   and there's no way we're calling it the night night gun   the bullets work   nonlethal  heavy stopping power   break up under the subcutaneous tissue     oh  with a dose of only  1 microliters of dendrotoxin   i'm not hermione  i can't create instant paralysis with that   you should have run the specs by me before building the molds  the bullets are hollow   it's a marvel i can keep them from breaking apart in the chamber  or used a higher caliber round   or read a book  have you ever heard of physics or     what's the other one     inertia  it's not particularly difficult     fitz simmons   fitz   simmons   i'm engineering  she's biochem   agent ward   coulson said i'd need my comm receiver encoded   don't know if you've worked with that model before   it's       brand new   he'll repurpose the i d i s  chip   don't need the external receiver for the inner ear comms anymore   so  uh  how does it     embedded sensorineural silicone matched to your dna   it's very posh   so  are you excited to be coming on our journey into mystery   it's like christmas       fitz  one of coulson's old s h i e l d  collectibles   flamethrowers  world's first gps   he's mad for this crap   don't touch lola   and he calls it a girl's name      lola's not just a collectible  you know   people tend to confuse the words  new  and  improved    this mobile command   they were in heavy rotation back in the '90s   but then we got a heli carrier   hey  did you hear the one about the guy who's afraid of flying   i've done a night jump into a drop zone under heavy fire  sir   i can handle it   that was a    joke   the first part of a     i'm not gonna tell it now   may  if you plan to unpack  make it quick   wheels are up in five   we may have a hit on one of the rising tide's routing points   good  we need to do some catching up   is that    who i think it is   she's just the pilot   melinda may is  just the pilot    come on  sir   what game are you really playing   better stow your gear       skye  how will you come at us   from the air   from the ground   how will you silence us this time   how can you   the truth is in the wind   it's everywhere   you cannot stop the rising tide   you will not find us   you will never see our faces   but rest assured     we will rise against those who shield us from the truth   and nothing    nothing can stop us in the     hey   what up       you guys are making a big mistake   you don't look that big   coulson  sorry for the lack of finesse   agent ward here has had a little history with your group     the rising tide   i don't know    what you're     okay  there are two ways we can do this   oh  is one of them the easy way   no   oh   what's your name   skye   what's your real name   that can wait   it's another name we need    a certain hero   what makes you think i know that   well  you made a little mistake   the phone you filmed the hooded hero with  had the same cryptographic signature  as a few of the rising tide posts   wow  yeah   was that a mistake   or am i now sitting  in the center of your secret headquarters   what is this   a plane   i got inside   and by now  you've discovered  you can't beat the encryption on my equipment   so you got nothing   we have a fairly strong coincidence     you being on the scene  right before it went up in flames   want to tell me what my team is gonna find out   how did you know the hooded man was in the building   did you blow it up to draw him out   did you   that's not our style   i was just kidnapped by your  style    s h i e l d  covered up new mexico  project pegasus   of course you'd be covering up centipede   holy no way     you don't know what that is   billions of dollars of equipment at your disposal   and i beat you with a laptop that i won in a bet   you need to think about your friend   we're not the only ones interested  in people with powers   we'd like to contain him  yeah   the next guy will want to exploit him   and the guy after that will want to dissect him   what is centipede     yeah  i get it  but     listen  doctor  people saw me  they saw what i can do   if i went public  that might be good   i mean  your product works   it works amazingly  and     yeah  yeah  i i i know what i signed   but if we got out in front of this  maybe     then what   you want me to go crawling back to the factory   i couldn't even get workmen's comp from those crooks   i don't think     yeah  ye     doctor  i just thought     okay     this was a lab   was this leased as a lab   mnh mnh  self empowerment center     with a top of the line motion sensor security system   ah  so a secret lab   and a superhero   not a coincidence   so  was this explosion sabotage  was it meant for him   or were they just in over their heads   yeah  working the problem   ladies  if you'll just     sorry   if you're gonna be in the field  agent fitz   you have to get your hands dirty     no  i don't         heigh ho  off to work you go      skye  centipede    it was chatter on the web  and then gone   i traced the access point mac address to that building   what were you after   the truth   what are you after   world peace   you pseudo anarchist hacker types love to stir things up   but you're never around for the fallout   people keep secrets for a reason  skye   well  just because you're reasonable and     firm     doesn't mean that you're not an evil  faceless  government tool bag   just give us your guy's name   he's not my guy   you understand he's in danger   then let me go   let me talk to him  me  not the t 1000 here   you want to be alone with him  of course   she's a groupie   all this hacking into s h i e l d   tracking powers     she might as well be one of those sweaty cosplay girls  crowding around stark tower   what   i would     it was one time   ward   is it the girl  she getting under your skin   sir   or is it the assignment   are you so anxious to get out of this  that you'd deliberately blow an interrogation    give me a minute alone with her  you'll have your answers   she's an asset   she is such an a     wait     asset    we don't know anything about her   do you appreciate how often that happens   that never happens   we need     what she knows   see  we designed each with their own capabilities   so  um  some recording  the dimensions and textures of the room   and then some testing the matter density  radiation   i mean  one is basically just smelling   fitz  whoa  whoa  whoa  i've got something in something   who's got it   uh    bashful   aww   surveillance camera  deep fried   yes  but that model  has flash memory in case of brownouts    now  i could sync that with data from the motion detectors  and  with a little luck   get some images from before the blast   and by  luck   i mean  unappreciated genius    yeah  we'll need it   snow's reading some compounds that are     whoa  my god   explosive   not of this earth   this is qnb t16   it's the top shelf martini of sodium pentothal derivatives   it's a brand new and extremely potent truth drug   don't worry  the effects only last about an hour   and you'll have a nice little nap   and we'll have all the answers to our     hey  what the hell    i'm sorry  did that hurt   no   but you've lost your mind   you should never do that to a member of your team   and  yes  it did hurt a little bit   but i always try and mask my pain in front of beautiful women  'cause i think it makes me seem more masculine   my god  this stuff works fast   don't trust us   ask him whatever you'd like   wait a minute   wait  you can't just      this is definitely not protoco     you seem nervous  agent ward   i'm calling to mind my training   there's no way i'm gonna reveal classified secrets  to a girl who's hell bent on taking us down   have you ever killed anyone   yes  a few   high risk targets   but they were terrible people     who were trying to murder nice people   and i didn't feel good afterwards   and does your grandmother know about these things    gramzy    my hands are tied  mike  it's company policy   you didn't meet quota  i had to let you go   gary  look  i got no choice  it's just me and my boy now   there's no openings  mike  and even if there were   i got a hundred guys standing in line that are just like you   only they won't bitch when their back hurts   i was injured  but i'm stronger now   i can handle twice the load i used to   what are you not hearing   you don't cut it   when i say i need things moved  i need       man  oh  hey  hey   like that   are you out of your mind    ohh   heads up   these are people  gary   men   not parts you replace when they break    it's not me  man  it's the company   i'm not the bad guy   i'm not the bad guy  man   yes  you are   it's simple now  just like we used to read about   you're the bad guy     and i'm the hero   coulson  did agent ward give you anything   he told me he's been to paris  but he's never really seen it  and that he wishes you had stayed in tahiti   it's a magical place   ward doesn't like your style   kind of think i do   what about his   remains in critical condition   employees could not identify the attacker   but security footage confirms  that this man assaulted the factory foreman  before damaging thousands of dollars' worth  of company property  this is wrong   this is not    the guy i met  he was     with us here on kzqm25   he just needs a break   then give him one   what have you got     coulson  michael peterson     factory worker  married  one kid   gets injured  gets laid off  wife jumps ship   good guy  bad breaks   best guess is  somebody tells him  they can make him strong again  make him super   who has the tech to do that   and why would they want to   fitz  what do we have from the security footage  before the blast     what are we seeing   well  the man is angry at the other man   the data is very corrupt   yeah  like cold war russia corrupt  yeah   i i can't sync the timecode without     what if you had the audio   i was    running surveillance on the lab   i had my shotgun mic pointed at the window before the blast   the digital file's in my van   there's too much background noise for me   but y could probably    you can clean that up  can't you   find a sync point and use cross field validation  to find    but i can't scrub for expression patterns  when the vit c is all    well  is there a chrominance subcarrier   yeah  attached to the back porch  brilliant   um  that audio would be great  thank you very  very much  we will take that audio  please   your van's here  but you were right     we couldn't decrypt the files   the encryption's coupled to the gps   get my van back to that alley  and then i'm in business   agent may will escort you   and on your way out  wake up ward   woman on p a   volunteer services to oncology 1   volunteer services to oncology 1   you're     oh  wow  you're    him     i'm glad you're doing okay   oh  yeah   thank you  they're beautiful     what the hell are you doing here   i don't know where to go  doctor   everything's getting     i i know what's right  i do   but no one will listen to me   i volunteered because you said things would change   and    you said you could keep it together   our first subject lost it     walked into the lab with a fricking bomb   i'm not like him   well  tell that to your foreman in the i c u   i saved you   you exposed me     you exposed the program     the people who gave me this technology     they are very serious   and they do not want to be revealed   mike peterson needs to disappear   you're right   i'm not him anymore   i'm someone else now   oh  please   you're juiced  mike   and you're losing it  just like the last guy     this is a disaster   no   it's an origin story   audio file should be coming through   it's not compressed  so it might take a minute   uh  yeah    yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  i'm getting it     so  uh  uh  when    when you get back   i'll show you my thing   a thing  it's not    i it's my hardware   my equipment   let's    hang up   so  the alien metal wasn't the explosive   well  i assumed from the break pattern  and dispersion that it was   but it's just dripping with gamma radiation and     oh   now it's actually dripping    fun   so  what did that get us   skye's sending us the rest of her decrypted files on centipede   but we have her audio  i've loaded it up   nice work    now  using motion estimation   bayesian inference  a beam splitter   and a little diffraction theory   our mystery man     appears   it's like magic   but it's    it's science   ward  explosives in the case   to please calm down  just let me check your vitals   i feel fine  i want to feel more   where's the doctor  where is she    i if you don't settle down  i i'll have you sedated   where is she    wait  did you    did you see that on his arm     coulson  what does that look like to you   a centipede   it's an intravenous filter for his blood   this goo  sir    very similar to the serum  dr  erskine developed in the '40s for the     super soldiers   i'm reading alien metal  gamma radiation  the serum     every known source of superpower thrown in a blender   we need to see the origin of the blast   run it back from the last point recorded     that should do it   let's head back   all right  let me just      mike   what are you doing  saving you   from the scary men in dark suits     and you're gonna help save us     us      don't cry   okay  stay strong for me  ace   what are we  we're a team   that's right   now drive   extremis   it's new   completely unstable   poor man didn't bring an explosive   and mike has the same stuff in his system   and judging by his strength level  a lot more   so any minute now  mike is gonna     he'll take out anyone within a two block radius   well     you wanted a bomb   simmons  sir   he didn't explode because he was angry   the two are connected   it    it's kind of a chemical surge   but calming him down will buy him a minute at most   he will detonate within the next few hours   solution   isolate him  get him away from people   or   put a bullet through his brain   if he's dead  this irradiated metabolic process will stop   we need to come up with a third option     one that doesn't involve mike's son losing a father   we have a couple of hours at most   there's no way that we could possibly     don't ever tell me there's no way   it's on you   get it done     may   he took skye   you all right   we'll deal with that later    at length   right now  we need to figure out where they went         how long is this gonna take   this is top speed  trust me   it's not like i'm deleting a facebook page   i'm bypassing the license bureau's  a e s  protected data stream   so chill   how do i know you can really do this   i've done it before     come on  give me more paralysis    less rigor mortis   oh  come on   no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no   just pretend it's an exam   we're taking an exam   an exam    yeah   yeah  okay   i don't want an  f     f  equals a massacre       whoa   oh  no   what is this nonsense   why are you making nonsense

can't go to the airport   so we'll    we'll take a train   and there  she'll    she'll help us start over   make a new life     a better life  like i always said     look at this place   you're gonna
