edgebono utoosis   good  thank you  justin   that is how you execute the duplication spell properly   real rabbit  duplicate rab   no   duplicate rabbit  real    lt's   anyway  there's two now   what's the big deal  they're rabbits   wait five minutes and they'll duplicate by themselves   remember  as with any spell   if you don't concentrate  it doesn't come out exactly right   cool  l've always wanted a guard rabbit   you know  scare off the mailman   l was thinking about dogs when l cast the spell   now  are there any questions about the spell   anyone who doesn't look like they're about to wreck their pants     the crazy ten minute sale    the crazy what   every year this cool clothing store  suburban outfitters   has this crazy sale for ten minutes  where they practically give stuff away and      what are you doing    fast forwarding to the part  where this sale is more important than the magic lesson     well  gigi's gonna be there    who's gigi   don't you remember  my enemy since kindergarten   when she spilled juice on my mat during nap time  and told everyone l had an accident   this is fascinating   tell me more   well  l'm sick of gigi  she's always rubbing stuff in my face   the point is  l'm tired of her always showing me up at school   can l please skip class on thursday to go to the sale   let's roll the answer dice  shall we   no  come on     but  dad     but nothing   look  you have wizard training on tuesdays and thursdays   and you're not ditching   you're right  you're right  l'm sorry  l'm gonna totally focus on the magic   l have a question about the spell   thank you   how do l use it to get cool clothes before gigi    are you as excited about the crazy ten minute sale as l am   l can't go   but l drew up a game plan so we could get into the store before gigi   l thought we agreed that we hate gigi so much we'd never say her name   but you just said ''gigi ''  okay  from now on we'll say her name backwards   but ''gigi'' backwards is still ''gigi ''  that's right  we'll say ''gigi'' but only we'll know it's backwards   lt'll be hilarious   l like it  anyway  do you remember  that one of a kind jacket in the window you've been wanting   lt's gonna be in the sale   lt all sounds good  but l can't go   lt's on thursday  l have a family commitment   do you also have a commitment  to letting gigi run all over you for the rest of your life   great  here she comes with her copycat crew   act like we don't care   bonjour  alex   bonjour  alex's friend   nice shoes   l mean  l don't care about you or your shoes   yeah  l've had these shoes for about a week   oh  l mean  l'd give them to you   but l already promised them to another charity   no  you should keep them  they go so well with your eyebrow   well  at least l don't have man hands   l mean  how do you get those meat stubs through your sleeves   what happened to you two   pick your noses so hard they fell off   they got nose jobs   when they heal  they'll be just like gigi's   when is gigi's gonna heal   people always take shots at the trendsetter   and by the way  l saw you looking at that jacket at suburban outfitters   and good for you for knowing you need a new one   but it's mine  and it'll look so much better on me   not if l get it first   well  good luck finding it  l already went down there and hid it   hey  that's not in the spirit of the crazy ten minute sale   yeah  whatever   come on  girls  time to change your gauze   look  alex had an accident again   gigi  this is silly   how long is this gonna go on   we've been fighting with each other forever   fighting  really  let's see   l've won  like  300 times and you've won none   so it's not really a fight   she has won an awful lot   that's it  we're going to that sale and l'm gonna show her up   but l thought you had a commitment   l'll work it out with my parents   sure  they're pretty understanding   no  l'm just really sneaky   honey  honey   listen  so l need you to back me up on this   l told alex she couldn't miss wizard class to go to some crazy sale on thursday   okay  wait   do you mean the crazy ten minute sale   that's the one   thank you for reminding me  l almost forgot   lt doesn't sound like you're gonna back me up   don't worry  l am   who's not allowed to go again     alex    right   wizard mail's here   oh  wizards weekly  let's see if they printed my letter to the editor   l wish they'd take those out for people  my wand didn't show up   that's bunk   l need my magic wand so l don't have to learn spells anymore   max  you're always gonna need to know spells   look  if l give you a bike  that doesn't mean you know how to ride it   awesome  l'm getting a bike   look  l know how excited you are about getting your first wand   so until it comes  how about using old black licorice here   yeah  that looks like something you get out of a cereal box   come on  this is a 77 wandwarp featherlight   they don't even make these anymore   l can see why   look  if you're not gonna take care of it  then l'm not gonna give it to you   lt has tremendous sentimental value   this is the wand that helped me get the goblins out of the basement  when l was your age   and it's a tremendous back scratcher  see   cool   lt's a little dinged up  but    you can see where l filled it in with black nail polish   there's a lot of great memories wrapped up in this wand   and a lot of stories l'm tired of hearing   she said it  we didn't     how do l look    why   because l'm going to duplicate myself   and if l look ugly  l don't wanna look twice as ugly   what are you talking about   l'm talking about taking gigi down   and it's gonna take more than one of me to do it   edgebono utoosis   now that's cool   l wanna make two of me so l can give myself a wedgie   why would you wanna do that   because l wanna see what it feels like  but l wanna get it from someone l trust   afternoon  alex  other alex   you're both clearly up to no good   max  just help me get me ready so it looks like l'm here so l can leave   wow  l did a great job   l look good   l was thinking about your stupid barking rabbit   yep  it's perfect  because that's what l hear when you talk to me   bad girl  no barking  just pout   yeah  l don't see how this could possibly go wrong   lt'll be fine  the real me is upset with dad   which means l pout and give him the silent treatment   yeah  but for how long   well  this has to pout for the ten minute sale plus travel time   which shouldn't be a problem  because my pout record is  like  four days     hello    alex  are you sneaking away or not   the doors are gonna open any minute and gigi's already in the front   how did she get up front   l don't know  but she's telling everybody you shop in pre teen   which l said wasn't a slam  because a lot of their stuff is really  really cute   like my sunflower top that goes with my rainbow socks   l'll be right there   wait  you're not wearing that  are you   no   you really think dad'll be fooled with this thing sitting here  with that glassy look in its eye  totally disconnected during class   wow  you're right  this could work   what if dad asks you to change seats or something   l don't know  cover for me   why would l cover for you   because l'll buy you a brand new pair of sneakers   sold   good boy  l'm off to the sale   and mom and dad know nothing about that  right   l'm a size 5   that's your price  a new pair of sneakers   apparently   but the joke's on her   l'm gonna get some new sneakers for doing nothing   what are you gonna do when she falls over   that will never happen   you're right  lt'll never happen   hi  harper   hi  alex's mom   oh  my gosh  alex's mom   l know it's weird for a grownup to be here   but since alex couldn't come  l'm gonna get something for her   well  this will be fun   lt's a chance for you and me to spend some time together  you know   chill   excuse me  there you are   how did you find me with all these people   l saw your rainbow socks from down the block   sorry l'm late  lt took a while to ditch the family   well  you didn't do a very good job  your mom's here     what    relax   l sent her down the block to find some tappuccinos   there's no such thing as a tappuccino   l know   wow  l'm impressed   you're becoming more like me every day     okay  move    sorry   excuse me  sorry   excuse me   nice try  gigi  but it looks like l got in the front of the line too   well  l know where the jacket is  and you don't   what's that  you're looking for a racket   well  l'm looking for a jacket  and l'm gonna get it before you do   l can't believe you brought your grandma  she's not gonna help you get in first   she's not my grandma  l found her at the park   she's here to block   where is it  lt was right here   excuse me  there was a huge pile of clothes right there   where is it   oh  we completely rearranged the store for the sale   because a lot of people sneak in early and hide stuff   lt's not really in the spirit of the crazy ten minute sale   lt's anybody's jacket now   harper   harper  l found our tappuccinos   lt's steamed milk and tap water   she's too heavy  can you give me a hand   why don't you use dad's wand to move her   l can't find it   either l just found dad's wand or l cracked my butt knuckle   l'm no doctor  but l'm fairly certain there's no such thing as a butt knuckle   no  no  no  no  dad's gonna wig out   you know  if l wasn't getting new sneakers  l'd be really freaked out   oh  l'd be really freaked out anyway   justin  will you at least help prop her up   sure  because she's done so much for me   what are you doing   dancing   with my sister   practicing for that new reality show  dancing with my sister   okay  guys  before we get started today   l just wanna point out the good example set by your sister   she really wanted to go shopping   but instead she's right here  ready to learn   l think we're all gonna learn something real soon   alex  l'm very proud of you   so proud that l'm gonna give you permission  to miss today's lesson and go to that sale   so go ahead and have fun   seriously  go   oh  l get it  you need money   l'm sorry  go ahead  take it  take it   yeah  alex  take it   alex used the duplication spell and went to the crazy ten minute sale   wow  looks like she did   this is way worse than me breaking your wand  right   you     alex  wand  alex  wand   alex   wow  he didn't even care about the wand   that would've been a good time to tell him l broke his new drill   you broke his drill   l think so  l'll find out when l put the pieces back together   check it out  my new ewand   oh  an ewand  the strap is for safety   good point   now that we've got safety out of the way  let's rock   slippery   wow  they should make something that attaches to the wand  so that doesn't happen   alex  hide  your mom's right behind me   what   harper  there you are   l found our tappuccinos  they're surprisingly delicious   l'm sorry  let's go tell a manager   eight minutes left in the crazy ten minute sale   eight minutes   are you kidding me   l've only got eight minutes to find something for alex   what do you think she'd like   for you to leave   what   this is your size   go try it on   alex  are you okay   l'm fine  l'm fine  did my mom see me   no  l sent her to the dressing room  this is our chance  let's get out   oh  no  no  no  l am not leaving without that jacket   l have choked on too many blouses to let gigi get that jacket   harper   l'm going back in   hey  what else does this thing do   standard magic stuff   lt opens portals  disappears objects  levitates things  and   oh  my gosh     what    lt's an mp3 player   lt holds a trillion songs   no way   oh  and it says here it has emimic feature   what's that   l think l just found out   hey  alex  why are you hitting yourself   why are you hitting yourself  why are you hitting yourself   why are you hitting yourself   l don't know   oh  l know what you're doing   we must be getting close to the jacket   you're trying to distract me   are you hitting yourself  you've got problems     good burn    l know  l thought it and then l said it   well  what are you doing now   what does it look like l'm doing  l'm dancing like a chicken   l don't even know why l try to embarrass you   l mean  you're so good at it yourself   l don't know what's happening   l do  you're dancing like an egyptian   hey  everyone  there's a freak show by the jeans rack   hey  alex  l think we caught a break   there's some freak show by the jeans  let's go look   harper  those are the jeans  l'm the freak show   faster  faster  let's see if it'll throw up     size 7  perfect  thanks  alex    help me   theresa  where's alex   jerry  she's with you   no  she's not  she cut class  l came down here to look for her   well  l haven't seen her   l think l just did   alex  stop spinning wildly out of control and get over here   l can't   what do you think's going on   l think max got his new wand   l found it  l found the jacket   hey  gigi  guess what's in my meat hands     give me the jacket  give it to me  give     no   well  it looks like the tinklee became the tinkler   oh  please  everybody saw her spill that on me   yeah  but it's on your front   lt does look like you went   but what are you two talking about  l mean  you just saw that   where are you going   we have the same noses   they're gone  gigi  they left you   okay  maybe you're right   this has been going on for too long   no  it hasn't  l'm just getting good at it   ln fact  l think it's time for a little announcement   okay  l know l'm in trouble  but just  like  one second   attention  shoppers  attention  shoppers   gigi's real name is gertude   okay  now l can go   these sales get crazier and crazier every year   oh  alex  dad's looking for you   and he found you   did you get your wand today  max   yeah   because whatever you were doing to this dummy  was happening to this dummy   oh  that's what the ''mimic'' in emimic means   l told you we should've read the manual   max  you know better than to use magic without my permission   you're right  dad  you're right  lt was pretty bad what l did   but not as bad as alex using magic to cut class to go to some sale   yes  max  thank you   and you and l by no means are done talking about this   l know  but before we get into it  l think you should know   l heard justin broke your drill   my brand new drill   max broke your wand     did you use magic to break my drill    no   you're clear  go   did you use magic to break my wand   no  l sat on it   you're clear  go   and we have a winner   dad  l know you're mad  but l can explain   gigi has been making me look bad forever   and this was a huge chance to get back at her  so l went for it   revenge     so you do get it    l get it   but let's look at it  shall we   was revenge worth missing your wizard training   was it worth having your brother lie for you   or your best friend lie to your mom down at that store   and speaking of your mother   she's got me trying to make her a tappuccino   so what you're saying is  by getting back at gigi   l was really hurting myself   no  but l like that better   so since l figured that out  l should pick my own punishment  right   no  why don't you take my punishment and duplicate it     you're grounded for one week    does that mean two weeks   oh  now it's four  l love this game   good talk  sweetie   oh  you hush up     so l'm glad you learned your lesson    me too   good  now  your mom wants me to take her out dancing   but the big game is on tonight   dad  that sounds like your punishment  not mine   then you see what l'm getting at   oh  you want me to duplicate you  so you can go dancing and watch the game   a little   oh  well  if you have to punish me  l guess you have to punish me   edgebono
