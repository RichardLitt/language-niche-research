question   if you had known  about addy before she was born     would you have done something   when i first met you  you said  that if they'd had the tests back then  that you might have     oh  don't think i didn't think about it   even after she was born  leaving that little bug eye out in the cold   that's what they do in china   but a mother     never turns her back on her child   every one of mine  was pure love   you have other kids  i have four   i should've stopped after the first   my womb is cursed   my husband  was the spitting image  of van johnson   you'd think we'd make
