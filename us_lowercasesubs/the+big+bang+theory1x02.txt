here we go  pad thai  no peanuts   but does it have peanut oil   i'm not sure   everyone keep an eye on howard in case he starts to swell up   since it's not bee season  you can have my epinephrine     are there any chopsticks    no need  this is thai food   here we go   thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the 19th century   interestingly  they don't put the fork in their mouth    they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth   ask him for a napkin  i dare you   i'll get it   do i look puffy  i feel puffy     hey  leonard    oh  hi  penny     am i interrupting    no  you're not swelling  howard   look at my fingers  they're like vienna sausages     sounds like you have company    they're not going anywhere   so  you're coming home from work  that's great  how was work   you know  it's a cheesecake factory   people order cheesecake and i bring it to them   so you kind of act like a carbohydrate delivery system   yeah  call it whatever you want  i get minimum wage   i was wondering if you could help me out    with something    yes   great  i'm having some furniture  delivered tomorrow and i may not be here  so     hello     i'm sorry    haven't you ever been told  how beautiful you are in flawless russian   no  i haven't   get used to it   yeah  i probably won't     hey  sheldon    hi   hey  raj   still not talking to me  huh   don't take it personally  it's his pathology   he can't talk to women   it can't talk to atractive woman  or in your case   a cheesecake  scented goddess   so there's gonna be some furniture delivered   if it gets here and i'm not here  could you sign  and have them put it in my apartment   no problem   great  here's my spare key  thank you   penny  wait   if you don't have any other plans  do you want to join us  for thai food and a superman movie marathon   a marathon  how many superman movies are there   you're kidding  right   i do like the one where lois lane falls from the helicopter  and superman swooshes down and catches her  which one was that   one   you realize that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy   yes  i know  men can't fly   no  let's assume that they can   lois lane is falling   accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second   superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel   miss lane  who is now traveling  at approximately 120 miles an hour   hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces   unless superman matches her speed and decelerates   in what space  sir  she's two feet above the ground   frankly  if he really loved her  he'd let her hit the pavement   it'd be a more merciful death   excuse me  your entire argument is predicated on the assumption  that superman's flight is a feat of strength   are you listening  to yourself  it is well established  that his flight is a feat of strength   it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings   an ability he derives from exposure to earth's yellow sun   and how does he fly at night   a combination of the moon's solar reflection  and the energy storage capacity of kryptonian skin cells   i'm just gonna go wash up   i have 2 600 comic books in there  i challenge you  to find a single reference to kryptonian skin cells   challenge accepted   we're locked out   also  the pretty girl left   o   our whole universe was in a hot  dense state o    o   then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started    wait  o    o   the earth began to cool o    o   the autotrophs began to drool  neanderthals developed tools o    o   we built the wall o   o   we built the pyramid so    o   math  science  history  unraveling the mystery o    o   that all started with a big bang o    her apartment's on the fourth floor but the elevator's broken  so     you're just gonna be done  okay  cool  thanks  we'll just bring it up ourselves   i hardly think so   why not   well  we don't have a dolly   or lifting belts or any measurable upper body strength   we don't need strength   we're physicists   we are the intellectual descendants of archimedes   give me a fulcrum and a lever and i can move the earth   it's just a matter of    i don't have this   archimedes would be so proud   do you have any ideas   yes  but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring   easy    easy   now we've got an inclined plane  the force required to lift  is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs   call it 30 degrees  so  about half   exactly half   exactly half   let's push   see  it's moving  this is easy   it's all in the math     what's your formula for the corner    what   okay  no problem   just come up here  help me pull and turn   ah  gravity  thou art a heartless bitch   you do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds  of you having sexual congress with this woman   men do things for women without expecting sex   those would be men who just had sex   i'm doing this to be a good neighbor   in any case  there's no way it could lower the odds   almost there   almost there     almost there    no  we're not     i'm sorry    no  we're not   watch your fingers   oh  god  my fingers     you okay    no  her     great caesar's ghost  look at this place   so penny's a little messy   a little messy   the mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy   this is chaos   excuse me   explain to me an organizational system  where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid   i'm just inferring this is a couch  because the evidence suggests the coffee table  is having a tiny garage sale   did it ever occur to you that not everyone has  the compulsive need to sort  organize and label  the entire world around them   no   well  they don't   hard as it may be for you to believe   most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fiber content   excuse me  but i think we've both found that helpful at times     come on  we should go    hang on     what are you doing    i'm straightening up   this is not your home   this is not anyone's home  this is a swirling vortex of entropy   when the transvestite lived here  you didn't care how he kept the place   because it was immaculate   i mean  you opened that man's closet   it was left to right evening gowns   cocktail dresses  then his police uniforms   what were you doing in his closet   i helped him run some cable for a web cam   this just arrived  we just brought this up    just now   great  was it hard getting it up the stairs     no     no    no   no   well  we'll get out of your hair   okay  great  thank you again   i just want you to know that you don't have to live like this   i'm here for you   what's he talking about     it's a joke    i don't get it   yeah  he didn't tell it right    penny's sleeping   are you insane   you can't just break into a woman's apartment  in the middle of the night and clean   i had no choice  i couldn't sleep knowing  that just outside my bedroom was our living room   and just outside our living room was that hallway   and immediately adjacent to the hallway was    this   do you realize that if penny wakes up   there is no reasonable explanation as to why we're here   i just gave you a reasonable explanation   no  no  you gave me an explanation   its reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers   don't be ridiculous  i have no peers   we have to get out of here   you might want to speak in a lower register   what   evolution has made women sensitive  to high pitched noises while they sleep  so that they'll be roused by a crying baby   if you want to avoid waking her   speak in a lower register   that's ridiculous   no    that's ridiculous    fine   i accept your premise  now  please  let's go   i'm not leaving until i'm done   if you have time to lean  you have time to clean   oh  what the hell   morning   morning   i have to say i slept splendidly   granted  not long  but just deeply and well   i'm not surprised   a well known folk cure for insomnia  is to break in your neighbor's apartment and clean   sarcasm   you think   granted  my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox   but i think the end result will be a measurable enhancement    to penny's quality of life   you've convinced me   maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet     you don't think that crosses a line    yes   for god's sake   do i have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time i open my mouth   you have a sarcasm sign   no  i do not have a sarcasm sign   do you want some cereal  i feel so good today   i'm gonna choose from the low fiber end of the shelf   hello  honey puffs   son of a bitch   penny's up   you sick geeky bastards   how did she know it was us   i may have left a suggested organizational schematic  for her bedroom closet   god  this is gonna be bad   good bye  honey puffs  hello  big bran   you came into my apartment last night while i was sleeping    yes  but only to clean   really more to organize  you're not actually dirty  per se   give me back my key   i'm very  very sorry   do you understand how creepy this is   oh  yes  we discussed it at length last night   in my apartment  while i was sleeping    and snoring  and that's probably just a sinus infection   but it could be sleep apnea   you might want to see an otolaryngologist   a throat doctor   and what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses   depending on the depth   that's either a    proctologist  or a general surgeon   i think what you're feeling  is perfectly valid and maybe a little bit later  when you're feeling a little less    for lack of a better word   violated   maybe we can talk about this some more     stay away from me    sure  that's another way to go   penny  penny   just to clarify   because there will be a discussion when you leave   is your objection solely to our presence  in the apartment while you were sleeping   or do you also object to the imposition of a new organizational paradigm   well  that was a little non responsive   you are going to march yourself over there right now and apologize   what's funny   that wasn't sarcasm   boy  you are all over the place this morning   i have a master's and two ph d s  i should not have to do this   what    i am truly sorry for what happened last night   i take full responsibility   and i hope that it won't color your opinion of leonard   who is not only a wonderful guy  but also  i hear   a gentle and thorough lover   i did what i could   hey  raj   hey  listen   i don't know if you heard about what happened last night   but i'm really upset about it   i mean  they just    they let themselves into my place  and then they cleaned it  can you even believe that   how weird is that   she's standing very close to me   oh  my  she does smell good   what is that  vanilla   you know  where i come from   if someone comes into your house at night  you shoot  okay   and you don't shoot to wound   i mean  all right  my sister shot her husband   but it was an accident  they were drunk   wait  what was i saying   she's so chatty   maybe my parents are right    maybe i'd be better off with an indian girl   we'd have the same cultural background  and my wife could sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me   it's obvious that they meant well  but     i'm having a really rough time  i broke up with my boyfriend  and     just because most of the men i've known in my life happen to be jerks   doesn't mean i should just assume leonard and sheldon are   right   she asked me a question  i should probably nod   that's exactly what i thought   thank you for listening  you're a doll   turn your pelvis   grab a napkin  homie  you just got served   it's fine you win   what's his problem   his imaginary girlfriend broke up with him   been there   sorry i'm late   but i was in the hallway  chatting up penny   really  you  rajesh koothrappali  spoke to penny   actually  i was less the chatter than the chat ee   what did she say  is she still mad at me   well  she was upset at first   but probably because her sister shot somebody   but then there was something about you   and then she hugged me   she hugged you  how'd she hug you   is that her perfume i smell   intoxicating  isn't it   hi   what's going on   here's the thing    just as oppenheimer came to regret his contributions   to the first atomic bomb    so too i regret my participation in what was    at the very least  an error in judgment    the hallmark of the great human experiment   is the willingness to recognize one's mistakes    some mistakes  such as madam curie's discovery of radium    turned out to have great scientific potential    even though she would later die a slow  painful death  from radiation poisoning   another example  from the field of ebola research      we're okay     six two inch dowels    check     one package phillips head screws    check   you guys  seriously  i grew up on a farm  okay   i rebuilt a tractor engine when i was  like  12   i think i can put together a cheap  swedish media center   no  please  we insist  it's the least we can do  considering   considering what   how great this place looks     oh  boy  i was afraid of this    what   these instructions are a pictographic representation  of the least imaginative way to assemble these components   this  right here is why sweden has no space program   well  it looked pretty good in the store   it is an inefficient design  for example  she has a flat screen tv   which means all the space behind it is wasted     we could put her stereo back there    and control it how   run an infrared repeater   photo cell here  emitter here  easy peasy   how are you gonna cool it     hey  guys  i got this    hang on  penny   how about fans  here and here   also inefficient  and might be loud   how about liquid coolant  maybe a little aquarium pump here   run some quarter inch pvc     guys  this is actually really simple   hold on  honey  men at work   the pvc comes down here   maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here   yeah  show me where we put a drip tray  a sluice  and an overflow reservoir   if water's involved  we're gonna have to ground the crap out of the thing   it's hot in here  i think i'll just take off all my clothes   oh  i've got it   what about if we replace  panels a  b and f and crossbar h with aircraft grade aluminum   right  then the entire thing is one heat sink   you and sheldon go to the junkyard and pick up   raj and i will get the oxyacetylene torch     meet back here in an hour    done   okay  this place does look pretty good   sync
