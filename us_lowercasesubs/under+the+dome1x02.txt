   1  invisible  indestructible   and completely inescapable   we're trapped   we don't know where it came from  or why it's here  but now that we're all trapped  under the dome together   none of our secrets are safe   who the hell are you   barbie  people just call me barbie   it's a nickname   my husband isn't here   but he'll turn up  you'll see   what do we do when the people  start asking about the propane   that's your business   duke  is it your pacemaker   stop   no one can hear us all the way down here   let me out of here   junior  dad   you can stay with me  come on  i'll give you the nickel tour   where is it  i don't have it   yeah  my boss is not gonna like that   you got one day   you hear me   listen  all you've got to do is pay up   you might want to think about it  all right   i mean  you don't want to do anything stupid   yeah   you all right   yep  fine   you were  uh  talking in your sleep   yelling  actually   is that thing still out there   yeah  looks like it   the hazmat suits haven't left   julia     thanks again for letting me crash here   with my husband missing   and everything that happened today     it was nice to have the company   i'll see you in the morning   great   did you lose something   yeah  you didn't happen to see  a pair of dog tags around anywhere  did you   no   but i'll keep an eye out   night   linda  linda   what the hell happened   who shot duke   no one shot duke  paul  calm down   he just got close to this thing   and his pacemaker exploded   ah   holy    if this thing  blows up mechanical things   then why didn't freddy's watch explode   it's a wind up   it must only affect things with batteries   either way  just check the roadblocks  and make sure nobody gets near this thing   well  who's in charge now   you're a cop  do your job   what about me   we need to take care of duke   joe  wait up   i'm fine   no  you're not   an hour ago  you were having a seizure   flopping around like a fish on a hook   did i say anything   yeah  something about    stars   pink stars   anything you want to tell me   no   hey   any luck  you guys   no  not yet   this thing goes down far   oh  my god  you know what all this means   we're so not having that trig test tomorrow   trig   that's a great idea   it is   i can totally map this thing   see if there's any holes   i'm coming with you   dude  you don't have to   buddy  lewis had clark  you got me  all right   come on   say     did you hear anything more about the military    on that contraption of yours    nope   i lost the signal  but i'm trying to get it back   it's not as easy as cuing up the next van halen track   now  why is it that engineers always act superior to djs   because we're smarter  phil   negative  sir   fire is ineffective against the surface   but we can confirm there is no radioactivity  emanating from the dome   they did it again   second time in 24 hours they called it a dome   yeah  i heard him  no  i don't think you did   because you'd be freaking out  too   we're under a dome  dodee   now  this is not just some invisible wall  where a chopper can drop in and rescue us  man   we gotta tell people   and we will   it's just right now we only know enough  to scare the crap out of them   to be continued       up to second gear  then come back down          daddy call his boss     faithful insomniacs  phil bushey here   it's been a long night   and if you're listening to me   it's because you've got no choice   you see  this barrier thing  is blocking all of the cell phones   tv  internet     everything in our humble burg of chester's mill   now  theories about what's causing this  range from the north koreans  to a breach in the space time continuum     well  sorry i didn't get to you sooner  rose   had to make sure the clinic  and the nursing home were taken care of   are you kidding me  if you're not careful   people are gonna start calling you santa claus   oh  god bless you  jim rennie   how much do i owe you   ho  ho  ho   oh  my god  the lights are back   did that invisible wall come down   well  i'm afraid not   but  uh  we've got gennies up and running   so we have some power   at least get back to some sense of normal   i don't believe we've met   councilman jim rennie  this is carolyn  and  uh  her partner alice   they're staying in my spare room upstairs   they're in from l a   we got trapped driving through your little town   we were taking our daughter norrie to    to camp   but we have to get out of here   our daughter is sick   she had a seizure   does your girl have epilepsy   no  it can happen to anyone   caffeine   sleep deprivation   i've seen it in my patients   she's a psychiatrist   well  i'm sorry you ladies  aren't discovering chester's mill  under better circumstances  but trust me   if you're gonna be stuck somewhere   this is the place to be   i've lived here my entire life   and  uh        no place i'd rather call home   jim   i need you to come with me   duke's dead   look at me  damn it   anyone   i wouldn't even bother   i mean  you could strip naked in front of these guys   they're still not gonna pay attention   i tried that an hour ago   they didn't even blink   oh   i looked around  by the way   but no sign of your dog tags   oh  yeah  no worries  you know what   i probably just left them in my car   so what makes you think  these guys are under orders not to talk to us   because they're not talking to us   maybe they did this  you know   maybe they're responsible   and why would they do that   i don't know   could be  uh  an experiment   some sort of portable detention camp   maybe we're being used as guinea pigs   whatever it is  these guys are the reason  my husband is trapped  out there   ere you heading   the radio station   they might not be talking to us   but they are talking to somebody   i told you  you're safe with me   mr  rennie   mr  rennie   help  help   mr  rennie  angie     my dad's not home  mr  rennie   mr  rennie   my dad's not home   mr  rennie  let go of me   let go   no    no   no   no  no   ah  n     get    off   get     what the hell do you want from me   look  i just want you to go back to being  the angie i knew before yesterday   we were doing great   and then this thing  comes down and you     you tell me to take a hike   i think it scrambled your brain   one of us has a scrambled brain  all right   you can't see it  but i can   you're sick  angie   but i'm gonna make you better   if i'm so sick   then why don't you take me to the hospital   if you care about me so much   because he might still be there   who might still be here   the guy i saw you with   what guy   yesterday   outside the hospital   barbie   the guy who came in with mrs  shumway   i don't even know him   don't play dumb with me  ange   i can see right through you   all he did was give me a cigarette   uh huh   what did i ever do to you    you loved me   no   junior     i never    yes  angie  you did   and when this thing comes down   you're gonna love me again   i will never love you   you were right   that guy     at the hospital   we didn't just share a cigarette   he screwed my brains out   and i loved it   i loved it more than i ever did with you   you'll never be the man that he is   junior   junior   sync   corrections by honeybunny  holy hell   he was a good man   i loved him   he was like a father to me   he was a good friend   you know  just before he died   he tried to tell me something   tried telling you what   he said there were things  that i didn't know about chester's mill   things that he needed to protect me from   what did that mean   i wish i could tell you   what am i gonna do with another body   the cemetery is outside the barrier   and my freezer's full   show some respect   this isn't just another body   this is duke perkins   what's that   turn up your hearing aid  lester   i said this is duke perkins   oh  no   oh  good lord  he's duke perkins   deputy esquivel   i'm so sorry for your loss   thank you  reverend coggins   i should get back out there   well  you're right  linda  go out there and do your job   i'll make sure duke here gets taken care of   you're using our stuff   you're high as a kite   so what  it's judgment day  jim   i might as well be feeling the rapture   the only reason we got into this  was to try to save chester's mill   no   that's the reason duke went along with it   you and i  we had other priorities   all right   i mean     i mean  at least now   we don't have to worry about him talking   real man of god there  rev   come on  let's go   what  where are we going   clean up our mess   dude  found a way out   check it   you're such an idiot   it's joe  right   yeah  mcalister   dude  this is the guy who saved my ass  when that plane went down   he totally said it was raining arms and legs   yeah  you could say that   what are you up to   so far  i marked these points   and by measuring the distance between them   i was able to come up with the y coordinate   and then by multiplying it by its k integer     he connected the dots   it's totally gonna be circle   so far  it looks like it's about ten miles across   it covers the entire mill   including some of lake eastpointe   and you did this   yeah  but we're being really careful   keep it up   where'd that guy come from   definitely not from around here   how do you know   'cause he's cool   come on  dodee  you just had him   patience  philip   did you get something   shh   air traffic has been rerouted around chester's mill  until further notice   continue to monitor the airspace   what the hell is that   jim   what are you doing   i was  um   looking for that   it's duke's will   go ahead  read it   he  uh   left me his house   everything   of course he did   he treated you like the daughter he never had   now what do we do   it was a close call   no thanks to you   what was i supposed to do  phone you   so what'd you find out   nothing to do with propane   duke must have kept the records at his house   yeah  but it's not his house anymore   he left it to the girl   so you better get over there  before she does  me   what are you gonna do   my job  lester   now get out   i'm the only councilman left in chester's mill   i got a town to take care of   you made this   yeah  i'm only three credits short  of my master's degree in electrical engineering   wow  how does it work   well  this is a harmonic microwave frequency converter   it turns low frequency waves into high frequency waves  so that we can hear them   maybe you should just let me hear it   okay   um  sometimes it's hard to pick up   further tests reveal  dome appears to be impervious  to high energy lasers  and all class a corrosive chemicals   we're under a dome   yeah  that's what they keep calling it   why haven't you told anybody   we're not a news station   hey  phil   and that was some face melting rock and roll  brought to you by    i'm going on   i tried to stop her   i'm sorry  what are you doing  i'm going on the air   no  you can't   this is julia shumway from the weekly independent   i have some news for all of us  stuck here inside chester's mill   i have just learned that the barrier  around chester's mill  is being called a dome   this information appears to be coming  from military sources  positioned just outside chester's mill   just outside the dome   we will keep updating you as information comes in   so stay tuned to     wybs   your only source of news from under the dome   what does that mean   i have no idea   i do  mom   it means we're all gonna die in here   this dome thing  how big is it   no idea   we're under a dome  are we gonna run  out of air  until i find out  where julia got this information   i think it's best that we just all stay calm   what if it collapses on us   great  now the sky is falling   if we keep our heads and we stick together   we'll get through this   hey   we'll get through this    huh  you don't know what this dome thing might do   you're right  but the last thing we need right now  is for people to panic  that thing took duke   who's next   pull yourself together and get out on patrol   people are scared  and when people are scared   they start acting stupid   yeah  you'd have to be stupid not to be scared   you know  i just hope someone tries  to blow this damn thing up   do you think he's gonna be okay   he's got to be   we're gonna need every man we got   think we'll ever see him again   who  rusty   come on  linda   my brother's not gonna let  some magic bubble thing  keep him from seeing you again   yeah  that is rusty   hey  you know what   i probably shouldn't be telling you this   but he's taking you to hawaii for your honeymoon   that dog told me that i had to settle for niagara falls   reverend   hey   how you holding up   we got our hands full  but i think we'll make it   yeah  you're in my prayers   julia shumway  back with an update   additional reports suggest that the dome  is not radioactive   but residents are advised  to continue to keep a safe distance   and now  something to take our minds  off all this trouble  what   hey   hey  hey  stop  stop   what the hell are you doing   i'm digging my way out   no  you're not   what the hell   any machine touches that dome   you're fried   says who  duke   his pacemaker blew right out of his chest   he's dead   duke's dead   who's in charge   what if we're trapped in here forever   i'll never get to make out with mila kunis   i don't think this thing  is the only thing keeping that from happening   just think about it   we could have met every girl we're ever gonna meet   that is so depressing   what the hell   they're doing tests   must be checking to see if water can come through   doesn't look good  we're screwed   wait   it's like a sieve   what the hell's a sieve   a strainer  douche   like like for pasta   so it does let water through   yeah  just a little   maybe we can get through   aren't we  like  70  water   yeah  it's the other 30  that's the problem  genius   this and  uh  can you give me a pack of filtered   actually  you know what  make it three   anything else   no  that's it   thank you   didn't anyone ever tell you smoking's bad for you   hey  no  these these aren't for me   it's an investment   we end up getting stuck in here for a while   you would be surprised  what people will swap for these things   so i'd probably hang onto that candy bar if i were you   what's wrong  you had it working before   it's not like punching in  the presets on your car radio  this takes finesse   finesse  my ass  she's just diddling   sometimes she gets lucky   further tests reveal the dome appears  to be impervious to high energy laser   how's that for lucky   shh   this is mobile ground unit 2   after exhaustive testing we are unable to determine the origin  or the composition of the dome   oh  my god   the military doesn't know what it is   so   so it means they didn't do it   they're not responsible   who is   empty   come on  come on   hey   what have you got there   why are you following me   so  this is where you did it   i don't know what the hell you're talking about   this is where you screwed her   i know all about you and angie   who's angie   don't act like you don't know   looks like she put up a pretty good fight   she belongs to me   that's too bad for her   she still belongs to me   you just stay the hell away from me   or what   the next time  i'm not gonna stop   ah   ah     the lord works in mysterious ways   ah ah  ah   ah   help  no  lord  help   aw  man   his master must've been right here   someone must've dragged the rest of the body away   poor fella   the
