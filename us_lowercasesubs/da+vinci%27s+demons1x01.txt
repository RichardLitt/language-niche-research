   1      davinci's demons 1x01     the hanged man original air date on april 12  2013     sync  corrected by elderman      will you smoke with me  da vinci   well  that depends on what's in the pipe   it is a mixture of tobacco and black hellebore  and is rumored to induce visions  and summon demons   well  i believe in neither   then why do you struggle so hard to keep both at bay   history is a lie that has been honed like a weapon  by people who have suppressed the truth   the knowledge you are destined to learn  will upend the established order of things   how could you possibly know that   you have heard the phrase 'time is a river'   yes   what most fail to grasp is that the river is circular   one man's death opens a doorway  to the birth of the next   would you like to know how  this particular doorway opened   yes   be forewarned  then   some doorways lead into darkness     out you go  boy  get on with you       go on  go on     cicco     what day is it today    palm sunday   oh  balls   the duchess and your children are already at the church   could you round me up some coddled eggs   i have a beastly hangover and my bowels are in a tumble   i'll be dressed in but a minute     at ease  people  i've arrived   be gone  you artless fuckwit  this is my moment   and thanks to the secret archives   it's the last you will ever enjoy   ah     tell me a secret  leonardo   what was your    earliest memory   or better yet   your greatest fear   in my case     the two go hand in hand   i was   um     i was six months old   no one remembers back that far   well  perhaps i'm unique  then     oh    my mother   um        put me in a cradle out in the field   and a falcon flew down  i can still recall it   it just perched there  looking at me  almost as if it were trying to reveal  some kind of mystery   my mother drove it away   yet  as clear as that memory is   the one thing i can never recall    is my mother's face   i can draw anything i've seen  even in passing   but when it comes to my mother  all i see is a void   she disappeared that night and i've been     trying to recall her face ever since   all men are searching for their mothers   that's what guides you between our thighs   i pay you to pose  vanessa   not to plumb the innermost depths of my character   if you expect me to bare my figure for you   i expect you to bare your soul in return   so  tell me  is there nothing else you fear   only imperfection   maestro  maestro   you're late  nico   you're late  verrocchio's been looking for you   well  he can wait  we've an experiment to conduct   you're meant to play a principal role in it     come on    hello   they're called breasts  nico  every woman possesses them   nico  that's vanessa   she's newly liberated from the convent of st anthony   now help me do this   climb into that harness   hey today   we are attempting to ascertain whether or not  this kite can provide the necessary wind resistance  to support your weight   well  maestro  what if it can't   vanessa  do you mind just dancing about for a moment   you see  those weighted ribbons  allow me to calculate the strength  and direction of the wind   in this case  i would say    it's about 20 knots  and shifting     westerly   ha ha ha   yah   wait  maestro  what if your calculations are wrong   wait  wait  maestro  oh  maestro  please  please stop   oh  wait  maestro  maestro   ha ha ha    oh  my god  please   aaa aaargh   yes   you're flying  nico   maestro o o   it's perfect   uh  uh   you're too high  not so high   nico   it works  it works  maestro   i never had any doubts     oh  god  i hate this place   what  where else could we practice our flights  but in florence   anywhere else  we'd just be burnt at the stake  for our efforts   but here  i'm just another free thinking heretic   chaos  culture   it's all celebrated within these walls   florence only demands one thing of its people   to be truly awake   like that angelic vision   don't even think about it  that's lucrezia donati   lorenzo de medici's mistress  i'm well aware of who she is   he'll break you on the wheel   if he catches you looking at her   but what if she's caught looking at me   bad tidings from milan  nico   how can you tell   that serpent on the rider's surcoat is the biscione   the sforza family emblem   if he was bringing good news  he'd have been dressed  in the more traditional red and white shield of milan   whatever the message is   lorenzo won't be happy with it   out   out  all of you   lorenzo  lorenzo   the duke of milan is dead     assassinated    by whose hand     visconti and two others    an honor killing  then   they say the duke deflowered his niece   sforza was a pig of epic appetites   yes  but he was our pig   i sense the vatican's hand behind this   the timing is just too perfect   if you're right  this upsets the balance of power in italy  lorenzo   oh  by god  becchi  this more than upsets   this all but decapitates the concept  and shits down its throat     we need to shore up public support   easter holiday is nearly upon us   let's throw a carnival   allow the people of florence to celebrate  the end of lent as they do its arrival   the more flamboyant the pageantry   the stronger we appear   we're not fucking peacocks  giuliano   carnival is all well and good   but if it has no teeth behind it   we might as well slit our own throats   are you frightened   no  most holy father   lying is a sin  my dear boy   it separates us from god's grace   yes  i'm frightened   but that's also a lie  isn't it   at least  a partial one   a venial sin  perhaps   so     which statement is correct   hm   speak  child   don't you want to enter heaven   the proper answer would be        please  his holiness has forbidden any visitors   our men succeeded  your grace   sforza is dead   florence is ripe for the picking  your eminence   trust me   you know this how   because i have an agent within lorenzo's ranks   the medicis are throwing a carnival   in a pathetic bid to win the people's favor   they're weak  your holiness   this is your chance to strike   not mine  nephew   the lord's   there is another reason for haste   the turk has arrived in florence   he's after the book of leaves   i am truly sorry   why   because you can't have heard this    do you have the plans for the colombina or not    we do   and they're breathtaking   then produce these miraculous renderings  and let us evaluate them   unfortunately     i can't   because they don't exist   by god  if you think you can defraud  the house of medici     no  no  no  they do exist  i promise you   they're in this chest     open it    it's locked   well  then  i'll take my sword to it   the chest is rigged to explode  if anyone tampers with it   are you mad   why would anyone engineer such an infernal contrivance   to protect my ideas  obviously   gentlemen  leonardo da vinci   ah  i've heard of you   they say you're quite the free thinker     you're late    grape   so  the first citizen of florence  is desperate for us to fashion him a colombina   'desperate' is a strong word   and yet it happens to be the word i used   but let's review   every easter  a grand procession makes its way  through the streets of florence   terminating at the cathedral   why do you insist on stating  what every child of three already knows   why do you insist on interrupting me   i have a methodology  we can follow it   or we can flail about   i'll take your silence as a vote for the former  onward   at the culmination of mass  a mechanical dove   the colombina  is flown from the altar on a wire   out into the public square it soars   it ignites a cart full of fireworks   the republic celebrates  they don masks   they engage in drunken revelry  now     for years  the house of medici has contracted  with inferior workshops to produce said ceremonial dove   but  this year   if i am to understand the politics afoot   the same shoddy pageantry  just won't do   no one's carped about our dove before   to call your previous efforts 'a dove'  is to insult the entire avian class   enough  just show us the damn thing   all right   ho ho ho   that is but a quarter scale model   there   it's a thing of beauty  i'll grant you that   yes  and it can be yours for 30 florins     30    yeah   the contract stated 12   that was for a bird that needed a guide wire   this miracle requires no such handicap   your work is impressive   but the price is too steep     30 florins is a bargain    30 florins is sodomy   perhaps i should be negotiating  with your older brother instead     for god's sake  becchi   just pay the degenerate and be done with it   you win  artista   as is customary with commissions   we shall pay half now and half upon completion   while we're on the subject of commissions   i'm told that there's an open one to paint lucrezia donati   lorenzo's mistress   stick to your whirligigs and parlor tricks  da vinci   take a lesson from icarus        so  tell me       is there nothing else you fear   uh  aah  aah   are you all right  leonardo   it was just a nightmare  andrea   you have them all too frequently   i'm having some issues with my mathematics  that's all   issues   i'm not sure     that the colombina will be flightworthy by easter     but the model      was a model   once i scale up the dimensions   the calculations don't hold  it's annoying   smoking opium won't help matters     it clears my head    it clouds it   what are you  my nursemaid  i think too much  all right   i need to dull my thoughts or i'll be eviscerated by them   i would have thought that you would have  understood that by now   the tears of the poppy have medicinal properties     the priests in egypt      we are not in egypt   and you are no priest   you have a gift  leo   a kind of   genius     the likes of which i've never seen   because of that  people will always seek to destroy you   please       don't aid them in their endeavor     how much for the starlings    six denari apiece   i'll give you two soldi for the lot   are you trying to offend me   no  if i was trying to offend you   i'd comment on the scent of fecal matter  wafting from your hindquarters   do you want the soldi or not   they're my last  i'm bored   no  i'm only interested in the birds   just open the cage on my say so   he's obsessed with flight  he studies them for inspiration   now   well  did you see what you were hoping to   for one of my soldi back  i just might tell you   all right  tell me   i saw an idiot who doesn't know how to haggle   look  nico  there she is again   look at her with lorenzo   everyone pretending the two of them aren't fucking     isn't that your father    crown prince of parasites   he serves as lorenzo's notary   come on  nico  let's stir the pot a little   your magnificence   my name is leonardo da vinci  perhaps you've heard of me   i am designing your easter colombina   oh  yes   you're the eccentric that verrocchio employs   i'm an artist  yes  and an anatomist  and an engineer of some note   'extortionist' is the word i recall using   i drive a stiff bargain  it's true   but the fact is  i have designed  a more ambitious series of devices  that i know your percipient mind  will take an interest in   move along  vermin   another time   perhaps   i'm wounded  nico   i need wine     how goes business  zoroaster   execrable  since the duke's demise   these are dark times for florence   case in point  those mercenaries flooding into town   if war does break out   they'll be the only ones gainfully employed   speaking of employment   a two headed calf  stillborn on zitto's farm   i can procure it  if you like  for your medical studies   the last corpse you brought me was already  decomposing by the time i took a scalpel to it   grave robbing is like fishmongering   you're at the mercy of the day's catch   come on  a boar sausage   you know damn well that i am a vegetarian     keep hoping to corrupt you    oh  i'm corruptible   i just prefer not to eat anything with eyes     potatoes have eyes    fuck off  nico   maestro   may i model for you again   no one looks at my form as you do   no one looks at any form as i do   go peddle your wares with botticelli   he's an easy mark   model  that boy's nothing but a hustler  and an artless one at that   but pleasing to the eye  nonetheless   piss   her  have a gander at these   my latest venture   they're called tarot cards   they're used to divine fortunes   here  pick one  nico   we'll see if it squares with your temperament     funny  it's a trick    is it   or am i simply channeling the powers of the ancients   how many women has that line worked on  zo   a respectable amount  thank you very much   and a goodly number of gentlemen  as well   but a card can symbolize not just one's temperament   but one's fate   do you dare see yours   tell me  don't hold back   this one     represents sacrifice   a suspension between life and death and then perhaps       a great awakening   i'm an idiot   those mercenaries  florence has no army of its own   so they're here to sell their muscle  right   but what if there was a more lucrative way  to traffic in the republic's unease     like what    i should promote myself  as a military engineer  not a painter   war has always been the handmaiden of progress   if i want to explore my ideas   i just need to cloak them in the guise of florence's defense   why are the officers of the night bothering that man   he's a turk  a heathen  isn't that reason enough   no   no  this isn't your fight  leo   when's that ever stopped me   what seems to be the trouble here   go back to your sketchbook  scribbler   this isn't your concern   you see  unfortunately  um     i have this character flaw  that compels me to intervene whenever stupidity rears its head  so     you see  cos that was stupid   cos your man's grip was too loose  and now he finds himself  staring down this handsome spada da filo   even more stupidity   cos if you'd just asked around   anyone will tell you that i'm ambidextrous  and perfectly capable of fighting two or       even three men simultaneously   bully someone else  dragonetti   you've made a serious miscalculation tonight  artista   it wouldn't be the first time     are you all right  sir    i'm more than all right   i am a son of earth and starry heaven   i return to constantinople the day after tomorrow   but i am staying at the inn of the black swan   come see me before i leave       maestro   a bit weird   what did he give you   a tip  i think     it was her mother   the same arse  very different faces  and  when i realized  i did a little sip on her tit   take him  nico  jesus  he'll never make it home alone   are you sure  maestro   it's after curfew and there are bound to be rogues about     then i'll fit right in  go    listen  leo   what   i didn't deal you the hanged man  that was all you   it was an omen  it was just like the two headed calf   i don't believe in omens   no  no  this is you  go   go       i know it's you  dragonetti   did you not learn your lesson earlier   ah   i guess you did learn      that's enough   i should have known   people are talking about you   and not in a positive light   i couldn't care less what they're saying about me   i care   i'll not have you tarnishing our family's name  with your flippant tone and your vulgar attempts at self promotion   perhaps you should disown me  then   you're my first born   and much as i may wish to disavow you   our reputations are intertwined   first born   you say that as if     my wife  margherita       bore me a son this past week   a legitimate heir   well  my condolences to him   i wonder how long it will take him to curse his lineage   as a bastard  your rank  within the social order has been rigidly defined   you should endeavor to remain within it   stay away from the medicis  leonardo     i'll not warn you again    i'll wager you will   why do you have to make this so difficult   it's my nature  i see things as they are   not as they might be   you     are a petty man   and   you will never achieve greatness   whereas i     i already have   you're kneeling in a dungeon   about to be hit again and again   by men who know how to hit   that's what you've achieved  leonardo   beat him for another hour   then toss him back onto the street  with the rest of the garbage   hold out the scribbler's hand     to be fair  you actually look more wretched than i  so     well done   perhaps you should see a physician   i'm fine   oh  they're executing a jew today   apparently  they caught him breaking into the book shop on the via dei librai   it should be good sport   i'm not sure a man's death should be characterized as sport   this fucking spot is too sunny   can't we move over into the shade     no    why   because every morning  at precisely this time   lucrezia donati comes to this exact spot to purchase     flowers   there   she's appealing  i'll grant you that  but       i'd rather bed that old toothless hag over there   now you're just being contrary   it takes no great skill to fuck a pretty face   but a truly ugly woman  that actually requires discipline  and  let me tell you  my friend  done right   a transcendent experience     nico  run this over to her   make sure she knows where it's come from   what the devil are you up to  leo   she wants to speak with you   uh huh  well  tell her i'm busy   you're seriously not turning her down   tell her  nico  timing is all   he can't right now    behold  a criminal in our midst   a jew  no less   watch him dance  watch him dangle   bring your fruit and small stones   god protect the republic of florence     i am a son of earth and starry heaven   i am thirsty   please  give me something to drink  from the fountain of memory       are you all right  maestro   i need to leave   is there a foreigner staying here  a turkish man   he said you could find him at the roman ruins   north of town   will you smoke with me  da vinci   well  that depends on what's in the pipe   history is a lie that has been honed like a weapon  by people who have suppressed the truth   centuries from now  your own history  will also be suppressed   how could you possibly know that   you have heard the phrase 'time is a river'   what most fail to grasp  is that the river is circular   one man's death     opens a doorway to the birth of the next   i saw a man executed today   he said something to me     i am      a son of earth  and starry heaven   i am thirsty   please  give me something to drink  from the fountain of memory   it is an invocation   a way for members of our fraternity  to recognize one another   i'm not a member of your fraternity   are you sure   this temple was once a place of worship  for a religion that originated  long before christ   we are known as the sons of mithras   much of what you call 'progress'  has simply been a matter of remembering  what was once forgotten   this knowledge was set down  in a compendium known as the book of leaves   recently  certain clues have surfaced  regarding the book's location   avraham ben yosef was following those clues  when he was apprehended and put to death   perhaps you have heard of the secret archives  the vatican has assembled   its curator is a man called lupo mercuri   a fallen son of mithras   where we seek to disseminate and preserve knowledge   they seek to alter and suppress it   i still don't understand  what any of this has to do with me   what do you know    about your mother   almost nothing   she    she disappeared     she was a servant girl    she was a slave   taken from constantinople against her will   do you remember     an incident that occurred in your childhood   you have suppressed it   i was a boy in vinci   i'd been sent to fetch some sheep that had wandered off   i found a cave   i was scared to go inside  but     but i was curious   so i ventured in   the next hours   are blank   i remember       stumbling out   my hands and face       were covered in blood   and somehow     i knew it wasn't my own   one day     you will sip from the fountain of memory       and learn more of what occurred in that cave   when that day comes  we will meet again   what do i do till then   search for the book of leaves   fate has chosen you  leonardo     i don't believe in fate    then believe in yourself   well  where do i start my search  then   with the hanged man  the seat of the soul   he's already opened the door for you   and my mother   she will be for you on the other side   all you have to do     is enter    maestro  maestro  can you hear me   maestro   we've been looking for you since last night  what happened   the turk was here   there was    there was a statue   an altar   must have weighed a ton   this place has been empty for centuries  leo   maestro  the officers of the night  have been searching for you   they say lorenzo medici himself has asked for you   leonardo di ser piero     da vinci   i am told you are my notary's bastard son   i am   i'm also told that you are a troublemaker   you are arrogant  impolitic       and utterly incapable  of keeping your opinions to yourself   arrogance implies that i exaggerate my own worth   i don't   my mistress  lucrezia   seems to think that you have  a singular talent for portraiture   she insisted that you and none other be the one to     capture her beauty   i'd say she has a discerning eye  then   a warning  sir  the man has a reputation  for taking many commissions  but finishing few   i wrestle with details  i bore easily   call it a character flaw   well  with this commission   you'd be wise to overcome it   when it comes to miss donati   boredom is the last thing i fear   i'll have your father draw up a contract then   sir  if i may  i have a few other designs       i have some designs  that i think you might be interested in   this will greatly increase your gunner's rate of firepower   so  while the top rack's being fired   the rack below that one can be loaded  and the rack below that one is allowed to cool   the cannons are arranged in a fan  which      that will be enough    this is an armored cart   propulsion is achieved by two men  who are housed within   they operate cranks  which rotate the wheels   cannons can be mounted around the perimeter of the cart   it's a flying machine   it's modeled after the articulated wings of a bat   madness  if man were meant to fly     he would have been born with wings  yes   but a similar assertion could have been made prior  to the invention of gunpowder    or any other invention conceived since fire   i believe man will fly and i base this assumption  on the fact that god has blessed us  with minds that are capable of imagining it   anything that can be dreamt of will eventually be built   anyone who says otherwise is a fool   what exactly do you propose   i wish to be employed     as a military engineer   i am a humanist  da vinci   i have no interest in waging war   and yet your humanism is precisely why war will happen   florence has no standing army   nor does rome   necessarily     you've both made alliances with states that do   florence with milan   and rome with naples   sforza's death has up ended the game board   you need weapons of your own  your magnificence   i will give you a modest stipend   to see whether these     contraptions of yours can actually be realized     shall we say 100 florins    50   if you haggle any further  i'll cut out your tongue   as you say  sir   thank you   you used lucrezia to gain access to me  didn't you   i utilize any device at my disposal   in order to realize my goals   clever   but i'd caution you not to be too clever around me   clockwork loses its luster   once one glimpses the gears beneath its face   point taken   is there a problem   none at all  sir   good day     congratulations  leonardo    word travels fast   ah  there are no secrets in florence   how the devil did you do it   oh  he played on a woman's vanity   your stratagem has become clear  you bastard   a bastard of the highest order   ha  drink up everybody   then get back to work  we've got a colombina to build   the jew that was hanged  i want you to unearth his body   i need to examine it   and my compensation   well  that depends how fresh the corpse is   ah  well  then  i'd best get digging   ah  here's the pazzi clan   with their schemer francesco and old man jacopo   probably the oldest family in florence   definitely the most ornery     the pazzi family entrusts lorenzo de medici  with this new fire   struck on stones from the church of the holy sepulcher   as is our right   granted to our ancestor for his actions  during the first crusade      the colombina is about to fly    welcome  all of you  into god's home        the flames of the phoenix suit you well   tell me  truly   are you always this wistful with the whores you bed   oh  you are no whore  signora   we need not continue this pretence any longer  miss donati   i knew it was you from the moment you approached me   how did you know     i sketched you      your features  your form  your bearing   the more salient question       is why would a noblewoman  risk her reputation on a lowly artisan   well  isn't that the point of a carnival   to pretend  for a night  that you're someone you're not   no  i think there's more to it than that  yeah   tell me  then   you were intrigued by my sketch   yeah  so     you felt that it captured an aspect of yourself  that remains hidden from your husband   and from your lover  lorenzo   the only time you see this aspect       is on the rare occasions  that you glimpse yourself in the mirror   and you find a stranger staring back at you   you knew i'd seek you out  then   well     hey  i try to work out what motivates people  and then i proceed accordingly   you manipulate them   no  i prefer to think of it as gently  redirecting their trajectories   lorenzo was quite taken with your designs   well  may i see one of these marvels   what is it   it's a device for slowing one's rate of descent     oh    yeah   and under what circumstances would i possibly have use for this   say that you were trapped in a fortress     a fortress    that had been breached   you could strap yourself into this     and you'd safely float down to freedom   oh  thank goodness   it would appear lorenzo's interest in you was justified   but tell me   i have risked my reputation by sleeping with you   you've risked more   perhaps even death   and to what do you ascribe my reckless behavior  then   love   don't be absurd   you saw me  you drew me  you fell in love   it's as simple as that   add in the fact that i am forbidden fruit       and your fate was sealed   you're the third person this week to lecture me on fate   well  perhaps it's time you started listening   now     fuck me again  leonardo   this time  remember       you're not the only one capable of manipulation   the secret archives are open  only to his holiness' closest advisors   for obvious reasons   we can't have you parading through the front door   ah   how rude of me   i promised you your payment first   i take it you're satisfied   your eminence   i bring news from florence   get on with it  then   a new player has entered the stage   an artist known as leonardo da vinci   the medicis have employed him to design siege weapons   artists are as common as court jesters   i see no reason why this news should concern us   this artist is different  his ideas are     unusual   revolutionary   my agent in florence   you trust your intelligence to a woman   when one seeks to convey a message   i prefer to use vessels others would readily dismiss   if i am not mistaken  you are lupo mercuri   curator of the secret archives     what of it    it may interest you to know  that da vinci has made contact     with the turk   he's searching for something called the book of leaves   it would appear the turk has found a new champion   continue watching him   see if he can be co opted   and if he can't   then da vinci will be consumed  in the fiery sorrows of hell   along with the rest of god's enemies      sync  corrected by elderman
