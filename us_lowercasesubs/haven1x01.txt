else  that's your reality   you're a good agent  audrey   and someday  maybe  you'll be a great agent   just    focus on the job   put the book on the table when you're done with it    stop   stop  damn it   stop  stop  damn it   don't make me shoot you   ugh   aaaah   this just in  six of tommy bolt's seven missing fingers  have been returned  this is ryan wisely at wdlh   the voice of haven

this bad     sandstone  likes to shift    uh huh   can i give you a ride somewhere   i guess it's friendlier than if i commandeer your vehicle   probably less paperwork  too   oh  i'm sorry are   are you alright   it's alright  i didn't feel it   huh   tough guy  huh   hey  uh i don't suppose you've seen  a guy named jonas lester recently   just left him   well  keep looking all you want  this man's pretty dead   he tends not to change much     chief wuornos  this is     special agent audrey parker   oh  it's the fbi  well  is this one of those situations  where you're here claiming to help  but you're really just here to step on my toes   not in these shoes   i came here  actually  looking for him   yeah  yeah  we got the alert when jonas  here  escaped   the bureau thought that he might return  to his hometown  i guess he did   ah   somebody missed something   there's writing on it   i can't read whatever this is  but it's worth checking out   i'll get it to the lab in bangor   why don't you enlighten us   what does the fbi special agent have in the way of insight   well  his injuries don't suggest a struggle   i don't think he was dragged here     you don't    he died last night   but your guys are going to have to give us the exact time  at first glance   it looks like he fell from up there  but his body  is way too far from the edge  you know  unless there's a cannon up there  or something  anyway  i'm not sold on it being an accident   you're over thinking this  the best thing jonas lester ever did  for this town was die   so  as far as i'm concerned  we're done   he killed a federal employee  so my investigation isn't done  until i know why he came back here and what happened to him   nathan  get yourself a real crime to investigate here   chief  how about i show agent parker around   while we tie up the loose ends  go ahead  waste his time  too   he's got nothing else to do with it     howard    it's parker   lester's dead  what happened   well  they're calling it an accident   but something doesn't seem right   sounds right up your alley  agent parker     chief wuornos doesn't think so    i trust your instincts   i'm working with a local detective  uh     wuornos     you call your dad the chief    i call my boss the chief   he's a stubborn man  what's his deal  is he testing me   not you  me   hey  no offence  but half the reason i want to solve  this case is just to piss him off  and it would   i guess that's one advantage of being raised by the state   not much parental conflict     so    you're an orphan    i'm a free agent   tuwiuwok  is that native american   migmaw  yeah  it means   haven    it's easier to spell  i guess   huh  these must be lester's footprints   it looks like they're chasing a second set right    here   and lester's end         abruptly  here   could be   well  that    that's strange  you guys get  tornadoes up here this time of year     maybe    one a year    really   'cause something did a number on these trees   no wind last night  i already checked     you did    couldn't find a cannon  either   now we're talking   nice gun  though lester wasn't shot   i did find this  a hat   i know a guy who wears a hat like this   so do i  but that doesn't make it evidence   lester stole all my guy's money   well  okay  so that makes it evidence   welcome to haven  you like pancakes   we've got good pancakes  what about lobster   and isn't maine famous for lobster  i don't like lobster   i really like pancakes   i like the truck   thanks  had it since i was 19   how do you keep a car that long

call you   oh  fierce  isn't she   well change your mind  drop by   we serve mai tais at 3     okay    i want to ride in the front this time   no  no  i always ride in the front     well  it's my turn now    agent parker   mris are overrated  let's go talk to mary   nathan  is everyone alright out there   it will be  this is audrey parker with the fbi   marion caldwell  this is my friend  ted ford     hello    is this santa barbara   yes  have you been there   twice  once for a pedophile  the other for a serial killer   marion and i are thinking of moving there and buying a shop   oh  oh   it's beautiful   it's beautiful  and it's a lot safer now   well  we're just        flirting with the idea   marion lost her mother not long ago  and i think the change might do her some good   ted's had antique shops all over   i've never left haven  so    it's a big step   uh  conrad brower  he works for you  right   yes  he does  he's been very helpful since my mother passed   and how well do you know him     oh  we grew up together    what's this about   do either of you know jonas lester   the guy who died  i heard about it   do you know where conrad was last night   yes  i dropped him off at the edgewater beach to go clamming   he made me stay for the first bucket  he's so thoughtful that way     i'm sure he is    whatever you might be thinking  agent parker   conrad's a solid guy  oh  he just couldn't be involved   conrad is the gentlest man i've ever met   excuse me  we need to go   thank you   okay  you know  this better be good  because marion might  have more to tell me about conrad   gun trace came in  belongs to a guy i know   duke crocker    you like him for this    i don't like him  period   okay  now  let's see what we're smuggling this week   hello  duke   duke   ugh  he's not here   everything about this guy is a pain in my ass   why  because he wasn't home   because he's unreliable  untrustworthy   a total waste of   yeah  i got it   wait  where are you going   to look for duke under the usual rocks   the police were just here looking for you     you shouldn't be talking to them    conrad  this isn't good   marion  you trust me  don't you   do you remember when we were kids  you taught me  how to swim  remember how afraid i was  to go under the water  you did it eventually   yes  because i was safe with you   i have always trusted you   but this thing with lester  i don't know  then let me handle this     i'm afraid  conrad    so am i   he hasn't shown up here  either   tell howard that i'll just touch base with him later   perfect  thank you   you took my clothes     good morning    you took my clothes   well  now i laundered your clothes   i saved your life   that's an odd combination  when you think about it   i mean  if you think about it  you must be duke   milk     one sugar  right   no  no  and why would you know how i take my coffee   i wouldn't   but it would have been cool if i did     do you know jonas lester    uh     i know he's dead   that's it  just    dead   you might want to rethink your answer   oh  really   yeah  your gun was found where he died     doesn't sound like me    well  you know     everybody makes mistakes   i didn't make that one   my gun was stolen  okay  so     of all the guns in the world  he stole yours   yep  that's convenient   and then  you don't report it   which is also convenient and illegal  actually  i did report it   nathan didn't mention that part  did he   i thought as much   so are we good  if you're telling me the truth  we might be   nathan really doesn't like you   oh  and let me guess what he said   uh     he's unreliable     dishonest  and a general pain in the butt    ass  yeah  he said ass   wow  and strangely  i was going to say that   i was  was he right   is the weather ever normal here   it's uh     normal for maine   'cause this damage  this is odd  and i need to get a bird's eye view picture of this   oh  oh no  my cell phone  oh  crap  it's    oh  yeah  it's toast   but i uh    i got you another one  a princess phone   seriously   you really need to work on your  thank you s   i don't care if he reported it   it's his gun  and he needs to explain it to me  well  you could have  told me that before i talked to him  the guy's not all bad   he saved my life and then he served me coffee   i've known him since he was 5   he's all bad  what's this   instant hail storm  the fog starts in town and then heads out to sea   there's something strange going on here   so what  it's weather  it's weird   bangor forensics restored the paper  we found on lester's body  turns out   it's from the tide calendar on duke's boat   it's boring  but it's real evidence   i know but 2 5 7 8 9  what do those numbers mean   that's what i plan on asking him   you coming  no  you go  i got enough  to take care of between conrad and the weather  suit yourself   so  have you managed to turn your accident into a murder yet     good to see you  too  chief    you're still wasting nathan's time   actually  i have a few leads   and your son just linked the tide calendar that we found  on lester's body to    tide calendar     oh  your messages kicked in  did they   hey  can you go clamming at edgewater beach at high tide   depends on how long you can hold your breath   you lied to me  conrad  i know you weren't clamming   makes me think you were up on that cliff with lester  you don't understand   no  i understand you lied to me  you had marion lie to me  you had plenty of reasons  to kill the man who ruined you  respect the perimeter     how did you get him so far from the cliff    please   stay away  agent parker  leave him alone     get away     tell me  whoa     stay away from me    marion  listen to me     don't you move    it was an accident  i didn't mean to do it     do what  exactly    kill jonas lester     what's he doing here    never mind  i can guess     what happened to you    you won't believe me when i tell you   just let duke go  conrad's our guy     don't think so    uh    no  no  he did not   conrad   are you saying you did this   yeah  nathan  that's what i'm saying   thank you  sir   can i go now  sit down   conrad  come with me   i know you didn't kill lester   that's fantastic  i'll buy the first round   i also know that nathan's right   and that you saw lester   okay  here's the thing  i have a rule   well  it's more of a guideline  but     i don't talk to cops   even cops that i like   we could have a customs agent assigned to you         and only you   what do these numbers mean   nice photo   i think an apology from nathan  might help me remember   fine  i apologize   for     don't push it    look   lester wanted me to run him up to canada     yeah    yeah  but smuggling escaped  felons is not on my to do list  the 2 5 7 8   is that a partial phone number  social security   lester was looking for a boat   maybe it's a registration number   wanna make this easy for me  no   i mean  not particularly   fine  harbour master will tell us the rest   do you mind taking care of that yourself   are you really buying this story of conrad's   nathan  what happened to lester happened to me  okay   he just    he blew me down the street   blew you down the street   listen  i can't even begin to explain it  alright   but it happened  and it happened to me   i know it sounds crazy  but     i can't even believe i'm saying it   oh  i can't believe it either   so what am i supposed to do   just pretend that it didn't happen  what kind of cop does that   you know how that will sound on a witness stand   listen  i know that i don't have it all together   and i'm just trying to figure it out  so i'll go keep  working conrad's story  and you check out the docks   excuse me  uh     i mean    you guys are going to let me go  first  right   no   what's this   that is 3000 square feet on state street in santa barbara   oh my god   if we can put the deposit down   we could be sipping margaritas before you know it   what do you say  what do you say   yeah  i think it might be time   yeah   we gave him that  you know   well  they're kind of ah    fragrant   not our taste  either   but when you only have of them     we have a little present for you    vince  relax   it isn't a puppy  here   this could be why i thought i recognized you     oh    we found that in our newspaper archives  from 27 years ago   who is she   i was hoping you could tell me   do you have family around here   uh    i don't have family anywhere   are you still puzzling over that fog   oh  more than just the fog   did conrad brower ever make the paper   it's easy enough to check our archives if i can use your computer  there   oh  yeah  go ahead     wow  that's impressive    you should see him use a google machine   you're hilarious   conrad brower  any particular context   weather   oh  i how this girl thinks   nothing much on conrad  just the usual returning war hero piece   a beautifully written war hero piece     obviously  he wrote it    huh   those weather patterns of yours turned up  though   there's that interview harold did with the hastings family  in 1956  right after they moved here  from calerin  georgia   they were the only survivors of a freakish series of storms  that destroyed their hometown  daughter was a cast iron bitch     dave    well  she was  it was a blessing when she kicked off  recently  the granddaughter is lovely  though     guys    yeah  well it must have been the caldwell part of the family     caldwell  do you mean marion caldwell    yeah   i traced that number  duke hooked lester  up with another boat  what did you find   marion caldwell's financials  lester came back to haven for her money   specifically  the 2 million dollars  her mother left her  that fits   we were wrong  marion wasn't protecting  conrad  conrad was protecting her all along   i think marion was on that cliff with him  that makes perfect sense   and lester had a partner   he got all this information about marion from   from ted   hello     marion  it's audrey parker    oh  agent parker  i'm sorry   but i can't talk right now   marion  listen to me  i know you were up on that cliff with lester     how did you know    it doesn't matter   lester was after your inheritance     i don't understand    marion  he was working with ted   what  no  i don't believe that   what were you doing up there that night   i was supposed to go meet ted to go star gazing     but he never showed up   yeah  ted got you up there and lester was going to take care of the rest   no  no     have you given ted access to your money lately   the deposit   marion   marion   i have to go   now   no    marion  wait   hello   marion   hello   nathan  marion's going after ted  and she doesn't know  what she's capable of  she could hurt him   and a lot of other innocent people   how are you going to find her  she could be anywhere   i know exactly where she's going     ted    marion     where are you going    just going on a small business trip   really  with three bags  and all my money   marion  it's not what it looks like   it was all lies  wasn't it   you never loved me  marion  please     marion     don't   marion  i've done nothing to  to harm you   liar   marion    i'm leaving now   marion  i'm sorry   you're a liar   marion   this doesn't concern you   look around you  marion  all of this is you   marion  listen to me   you've hurt people and you're going to keep  hurting people  the wind that killed  lester  the fog  the hail   all of this  you're doing this   you need to make it stop   let it go   just let it go   i know  i know   it's okay  it's okay   i know     got this car fixed up    hertz is gonna put a hit out on me   when you were up at tuiw  um     tuwiuwok  it means     haven   the full name means  haven for god's orphans      orphans    yeah  people liked haven better   yeah  i suppose they would   anyway  i know why you were up there that night   to keep an eye on marion   i always have  i didn't trust ted as far as i could throw him   or uh    maybe you just    loved her   it's time to step up  conrad  how's that   i could put her in jail  but what would that solve   if marion lets her emotions get out of control again   a lot of people could get hurt   only three of us know what she can do   but only one of us has a real chance of making her happy   she needs somebody to keep her safe   and most importantly  calm   i should have listened to you   it's okay  i'm not sure i would listen to me either   i won't make that mistake again   oh  i'm sorry  the perimeter   i know   lilies and lilac   you're an odd man  detective   how's your shoulder   it's alright   oh  tough guy   so  you tie up the loose ends on lester   he and ted worked it from the start   then lester got picked up on a routine parole violation  then broke out so ted wouldn't  walk off with his share  how's marion doing with all this   she's still grappling with the idea  that she affects the weather  you still believe that   and you still don't   when you've ruled everything else out  you have to accept what's left   guess i'm not ready to rule everything else out yet   i know that picture     you do    mmhmm   colorado kid murder   chief was a beat cop on the case   he never solved it  which i try and remind him of whenever i can   the chief   you mean your dad   i mean the chief   can i see it   she looks like you   yeah   yeah  i know   so what do you think  is she your mother   your aunt   i really  i don't know   you know  every other kid i knew dreamed that their parents  would come and claim them  and then they'd turn out  to be rock stars   but i  i just dreamed that         you know  never mind   too late to stop now   i dreamed that my mother would roll up in a big bus   and she would rescue every kid in every orphanage  in the world and bring them home   might be a good idea to let that one go   yeah  well i wish i could     howard    hey  boss   uh    you know that vacation time i never take   i need a few weeks   there's just something i need to look into   no problem  you deserve it   she's staying   maybe she can help you with your troubles   sync by mczolly
