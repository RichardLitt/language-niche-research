   1  what is that  three in a row   that would be four  actually     oh  god    come on   what do you say  we go five outta nine   so you can keep abusing me  no  thank you     i'm done    oh  come on   i'll spot you three   game time's over  wyatt  they're here   they're here   you can set up in the conference room   yeah  no  i'm just     get set up in the conference room     you did let him win  right    it wasn't easy   the guy has the coordination of a two year old   i know  the last time these venture capitalists came in   i took him boxing to calm him down   i basically had to punch myself in the face to let him win     i don't get it  i mean  if he's such a genius   why does he get so nervous around a bunch of investors   eh  you spend two years working on  a satellite phone that fits in your pocket  and then bet the company on it   you'd be a little nervous too  i think   the prototype     i can't find it  i don't know where i      you mean this      i don't know what i'd do without you     fail miserably    i would     is that the       20 million prototype  yes   and you don't even get to look at this bad boy  until after we close the deal today   wow  they're like storm troopers   storm troopers don't write checks   now all you gotta do is walk in there   show them how the phone works     right  and suntech digital will be a new force  in global communications  let's knock 'em dead   all right   wait  wait  where do you think you're going   into the room with the people   wrong  that's the adult table in there   and you haven't earned the privilege yet   but i played air hockey with him    you need to go back to the office  and file a patent for the phone   a patent  i don't know how to file a patent     figure it out    can't we do that after    no  and you keep talking  i'm gonna start billing you   and my time runs  1 000 an hour   but isn't this our time  mr  hand   i stand corrected   your fast times at ridgemont high quote   that proves you belong at the adult table   hey  that's a great movie   and it spoke to a generation     hey  you busy   okay  have you ever filed a patent before   i just got back from this meeting with harvey  and he wants me to file this patent   but i have no idea what that paperwork looks like   so   any help in this arena would be re      did harvey call you and tell you to do that   if it isn't the golden boy   you're harvey's project  right   what's your name  mike  mike ross   gregory boone   so what are you doing here   weren't you signing some big deal this afternoon downtown   well  evidently i haven't earned the privilege yet   get the adult table speech   yeah  instead of watching the deal close   i get to file the patent   yeah  those suck   wait  you  you've done one of these before   like 100  why   uh  uh  uh  uh   now   it's okay  you don't have to apologize   i took care of it   patent claim   i negotiated a deal to get it done   what are you talking about   gregory  he agreed to file it for me   and all i have to do is proof his bainbridge briefs   ah  that explains why he said to give you this   and why he called you a sucker   he called me a what now   mike ross  allow me to introduce the bainbridge briefs     which stack    all of them   wait a minute  are these all    still printing  yeah  i'd give it about a half hour   um   that's six printers   that's 4 140 pages  plus all this   which means the next time you negotiate a deal   i would suggest to get your facts straight   uh    i am a sucker   mm hmm   when did that happen             suits 1x02     errors and omissions original air date on june 30  2011      greenback boogie         sync  corrected by elderman     nice of you to join us this morning   for your information  mr  sunshine   i've been here all night proofing   that belongs to   okay   where's my confirmation   what   the fact that you don't know already concerns me   oh  you mean the patent thing    the patent thing  is the only piece of paper  that's holding up our deal from yesterday   where is it   it's on my desk   well  if it's not on mine by the time i get back   i'm gonna feed you to louis   no problem   please tell me that you filed that    patent  no  not yet   i gave it to you yesterday   at the same time i gave you my bainbridge briefs   which you haven't finished   i was here all night  and i barely got through half   and i was on hold for almost 11 minutes  before i gave up on your patent  so what's your point   i swear i will finish those filings   but you have to give me this patent confirmation  before harvey gets back   sorry  golden boy  deal's a deal              what do you think you're doing   uh   i'm proofing briefs  why     is there a problem    yeah  there is   that's gregory's responsibility  why are you handling it   oh  i   volunteered    he didn't pawn it off on you     no    no   i mean  he didn't even want me to do it   but you know  i i i had some extra time   so i insisted      congratulations   you've shown loyalty to your fellow associates   i know gregory tricked you into doing his work   i wanted to see how you react when pressed about it   you held up   i respect that   thanks   see  but i don't understand something now   if you didn't know how to file a patent   then why didn't you just run to harvey     he was busy   but you see  mike  that's why you come to see me     look  mike  i know    i can come across a bit     prickly     but we're a team here   that means i'm here to help   okay  all right   so can you help me now   i already have   are    thank you  louis    donna  blue is your color   is harvey back    no  can i put this on his desk   yes   will you tell him i put it there hours ago   what time you want me to say     11 00 am    absolutely     and then maybe i can use my access to his bank accounts   to buy myself a house in the hamptons     12 15    no      you wanted to see me   sit down   i looked through your work on the bainbridge briefs   spectacular     you caught the discrepancies  between listed assets and potential assets   that had a huge impact  mike   yeah  i know  millions   but anyone would've caught that  right   um  out of the 50 associates that are under purview   not one of them would've caught that   you just have this eye for detail  mike   i mean  no wonder harvey's so crazy about you   it's amazing  i mean  i really   really  seriously appreciate that   hey  thank you  louis   that's nice   you know that i pick a     pony out of the herd every year  don't you     a pony    oh  yeah   someone who shows potential   stamp my own little brand on him   mm   are you that pony  mike   i   work for harvey   as you should   good   well  listen  i have some work to get to   so maybe we can meet for lunch tomorrow at the club     say  1 00pm    uh  you know  tomorrow     i know i just posed that as a question   but i really didn't mean it that way   hey  what's up   we just heard from wyatt   he got a response from the patent office   and   it's been denied   what   evidently  there was a similar claim   wait  what do you mean  somebody beat us to it   no  someone beat you to it   they filed less than 24 hours ago   which means you filed a day later than you said you would   i tried to tell you that i didn't know how to do that   and i told you to figure it out   and i did  and it got filed   after you lied and said you'd already followed through   okay  what's gonna happen now   i suggest you get on the phone   call the patent office  and find out who beat us to it   then you're gonna have donna find any judge who will listen   so we can get an injunction   and stop whoever it is from launching their product first   okay  got it   now i've gotta call wyatt and calm him down   you think that's gonna be a walk in the park   hey  harvey     did you tell him it was me   why would i do that  i'm responsible for you   it was me       they signed the paperwork  wyatt   they can't pull out   the patent dispute is not an issue  okay   no  they cut the check  end of story   i'm in court right now  let me call you back   so it's velocity data solutions   did you serve them with notice of the hearing   a billion dollar company   the bigger they are  the harder they fall   did you not see the sign outside   i'm just putting it away  your honor   it should already be in your pocket   but you were already running late   so perhaps that's why it wasn't   let the records show that the counsel is fined  1 000  for failing to follow the posted rules of the court     your honor  i didn't mean     and for mouthing off    mouthing off   another outburst like that  and you will be escorted out   wow   mr  salinger   your honor  this is a waste of your time   the u s  patent office is the only judicial body  that should be handling this dispute   velocity data solutions requests dismissal   your honor  if i may     this injunction request     counsel approach   that's the exhibit filing   why wasn't i given a courtesy copy   given the expedited nature of this hearing  i    hand it to me  hand it to me   and i would've assumed that a lawyer  appearing before a judge would come on time   with his mouth shut  and prepared with a courtesy brief     my apologies    request denied    court adjourned for morning   better luck next time  harvey   from now on  i want him when i go against you   wait here     your honor  i have     send him in   counselor   you asked to see me   you must have something to say   excluding friends  associates   and the clients that i represent   there are very few people  that i'm on a first name basis with   and i've never had anyone   let alone a judge i've never met   address me as harvey in open court   but if you're gonna screw me   i guess it's only fair that you call me by name   i could have you brought up on review  for talking to me like that   then we can get it all on record     get what    whatever it is  that you seem to have against me for no apparent reason   i have a solid argument for any reasonable judge  to grant my injunction  so solid it begs the question   why do you have it in for me   and i don't even know your first name   really     my wife never mentioned it    your wife   the woman you had an affair with last month   hey wait  what happened in there   donna  the address for that fundraiser  at the gallery last month   i need you to text it to me  and clear my afternoon     hey  where are we going   you're going back to the office to file  an interference claim with the patent office   okay  wait  what's that   it's how they determine who wins these situations   it's not always who filed first  so we have a chance   so why didn't we do that in the first place   because it takes longer   and i wanted to head velocity off at the pass   hey  where you going   to iron out a wrinkle     if you're really interested  come back tomorrow around 1 00   the afternoon light really makes this canvas come alive   pardon me  i was wondering  would i get a discount  for being the guy you cheated on your husband with     can you excuse me for a second   what are you doing here   i had a hearing in front of the judge this morning   it didn't go very well     why did you lie to him    i'm sorry   i mean  i recall you being tipsy that night   but i'm finding it hard to believe  that your memory is so cloudy   you forgot i sent you home in a cab   after humiliating me   i was the perfect gentleman   yes  exactly   i fall all over myself making a pass   and you do the right thing and send me home   i'm sorry you felt humiliated   but i told you  i don't sleep with married women   right  the moral code   no  it's too big of a pain in the ass   as evidenced by my experience in court this morning   what do you want from me  harvey   i need you to tell him the truth     i can't    yes  you can     why didn't you just tell him    he's never gonna believe me   and what makes you think he'll believe me   because he'd want to   our whole marriage  donald's only cared about one thing   his sterling reputation   never overturned   i was  when he found out you and i had     he changed   he looked at me for the first time again   like i mattered   i'm sorry  i can't tell him     no  this is a request from the applicant for    yes  but i have up to a year before you      hello  no  i can't hold      you ready   i can't go to the club  i have to do this for harvey   yes  the person before you said that i had  to file the blue form     no  no  no  no   we have a court reserved in  yes  i'm trying to file the oral hearing   but what you people keep doing is trans  hello   hello     you work for me  too   and that means when harvey is not here   you gotta listen to what i say  mike   louis  this claim needs to be filed today   harvey's orders   in that case    gregory   i'm on your side  remember   watch this  yes   hi  patent interference claim     can you have it filed before we get back   cool  thanks  let's go   what's with the       who's winning     you need to warm up    no  i'm good   you serve first  come on  show me what you got    all right  you wanna play like that   let's do this thing  come on   wait  wait     hey  tom   game  hey  tom   we should definitely have lunch to talk about    i mean  i have seen your approach shot  man   you have really improved  i'm not kidding   you know  maybe you can play now   me and my associate were just starting up   how about you two against me  i'll just play    tom  seriously  i'll even    i'll spot you three sets   all right  i'll see you later then       isn't that  uh       it's tom keller   yeah  the premiere fantasy sports guy  right   that's him  yeah  i play it ever year   yeah  you and five million other fantasy footballers   i mean  the guy generates  and he still uses his fraternity brother as a general counsel   i mean  someone with that many assets just makes me sick   okay     so is it my serve    let's hit the showers   but  wait     sorry  sir  but    no introductions necessary  we're on a first name basis   i brought you a present   yours to keep  after you sign my injunction     a pen    it's custom   french  le bic   oh  my earlier ruling wasn't clear enough for you   crystal  but i didn't want you to suffer for it   you see  if you don't sign my injunction   there's gonna be a lawsuit   and when the next judge sees all the facts   he's gonna overturn your ruling   you may be right   but by then your clients will have dumped you   you may be right  but that sterling reputation  that you value so highly    down the tubes   which would matter  except for one thing   i've decided to leave the bench   try my hand at litigation   and i'm your last case   divorce will do that  make you wanna change your life     you filed for divorce    soon enough   perhaps we could discuss  a little quid pro quo before i do   i'm listening   you sign a document that says you slept with my wife   i'll give you your injunction   and why would you want me to do that   to prevent her from taking me for half of everything i own   so what you're saying is you'd like to blackmail me   i'm saying we could both benefit   and since you're the one who screwed me   i'd say you owe me one     harvey specter   what are you hiding from me  harvey   wyatt  do you remember  six months ago when you got all nervous  and you thought everything was falling apart   yeah  yeah  but this is a little different   that's what you said then   and a year ago  and 18 months ago   and we agreed that when this happens again   i'll remind you of those times  and i'll hang up    okay  harvey    trust me  it's for your own good   harvey  please don't hang up    hey  tom  you just missed a great game   we were  uh    we were just re    i was beating him   you know  ten years ago   before these dot com millionaires   in this club   you know  men who understood how business gets done   well  maybe he's just not interested in talking business  while he's in a towel  like  he's not interested  because he doesn't think i'm cool   and he's a pothead who thinks  that anybody who doesn't smoke is a nerd   i mean     so i treat my body like a temple   does that make me uncool  i don't think so   no   but on the other hand     you kinda seem his type     why do you say that    because you're young   and you think of yourself as   hip   whatever  i guess  you know  i'm sure you  enjoyed the occasional bong hit   no  no  i don't smoke     i mean  that's just a little strange   why is it strange   i mean  because the drug test that you took    well  that i made you take   would indicate otherwise   you're not gonna dispute it now  are you     relax  mike   relax   i'm not offended   i'm not even surprised   and in fact  in this instance   we can use this to our advantage   what are you talking about  louis   i'm just saying  you know  back in the day   to woo a client you would take him to dinner   you would buy him a drink   but that's not gonna work with tom   not in a million years  not with me  anyway   but with someone of his generation  who shares the same proclivities   you saying you want me to smoke pot with him   i'm saying you can help me land him as a client   that's the only reason i'm here  isn't it   no  mike  stop   just stop  okay   i assure you  no one was more disappointed than me  when i found out the results of your drug test  okay   then i had to say to myself   louis  do what you do   make lemonade    and if i don't   you're a smart kid   and i really wanna see you succeed   ball's in your court   hey  tom  i was just gonna tell you   i wanted to   okay     dude creeps me out  man   and he never wears a towel  ever   yeah  tell me about it   hey  i know you must hear this all the time   but totally addicted to your website  man   all right  who placed sixth in passing yards last year    carson palmer    how many sacks did james hall have    uh uh  ten and a half     yeah  i know  i rounded up    well  your league doesn't  or i would've come in better than 20th   your ross's raiders  right    yeah  mike ross     tom keller    good to meet you   congratulations  man  you got a nice little team there   yeah   no  if roethlisberger hadn't let you down   you'd have been top ten for sure  i'm telling you   yeah  well  that's what happens  when you get high before the draft  right   you get high        mm     oh     how's it going with harvey   me   uh   it's    you know  it's good   i'm learning     a lot of learning  bye       what's black and white and gonna cost you dearly    whoa   took me all morning to file this  golden boy   you owe me and i won't forget it   oh  god  thank you    you smell papery     wyatt  it doesn't happen immediately   the paperwork's coming   don't worry about it  okay   boom  there you go  look at that   wyatt  let me call you back  okay   five minutes  bye     what's this    what is this   that's confirmation of the interference claim  which i proofed  up top   what  you think you're working in a fraternity   you don't barge in here when i'm on the phone        and why you so flushed     why am i so what    your face is red   it looks like you've been in the sun   um   yeah  i    i  this morning  louis took me to the tennis club   he didn't give you the speech about the  um   the ponies  did he  oh  my god   how he likes to cut one from the herd    the ponies   was he wearing the headband   you know about the headband  with the     oh  my god  are you kidding me with that guy   hey  if you guys were playing tennis all morning   how'd you have time to file this   uh     he  it was this morning    actually  i was on the phone with them   and louis helped me     look at me     and he did this snapping thing  and gregory    look at me   you're high   get out     harvey  you don't understand  louis    out   donna   can you get wyatt back on the line   what are you doing in here   it's the ladies room    i'm sorry   look  can you do me a favor  can we    can we just keep this our little secret   why are your eyes so red     i need some air   you took mike ross on a field trip today     yep    aside from subjecting him  to you in a towel  what happened   well  i beat him in straight sets   if that's what you're get     don't play dumb  louis   tell me what you did to him    what're you  jealous   harvey  come on  the kid is starving for a mentor   someone to give him some advice   so maybe if you just took the time    i'm telling you right now  you try to move in on him    harvey  where is this coming from   harvey  i've got the outside counsel  for velocity on the line  put them through   what happened after you smoked with that guy     here    i just got paranoid   i felt bad for lying to him   i told him that louis put me up to it  and that he couldn't trust him   so what did he say   he said that louis gave him the creeps anyway   you know  he's never gonna hire him   okay  you have to tell harvey   i tried  he wasn't listening   so then go home and tell him tomorrow   oh  god  you should've seen his face     we had a deal    what deal     thanks for hearing me out    no  what're you talking about   what deal  it's nothing   i just promised that i wouldn't     do anything stupid and let him down  and i did   wait  you let him down   no  the way i see it  he let you down    what   he's gotta know what louis is capable of   so if he didn't listen to what happened  it's 'cause he didn't want to   mike  you need to tell him   i don't know how often you come across harvey   but he's not exactly the listening type   right   but he's also the first person that would tell you  never to take no for an answer from anyone   harvey  how you doing this fine day   i'm ready to hear your settlement offer  george   cutting to the chase  i like that   what's the number   ten million   that's half what we spent developing the prototype   and ten million more than you'll get   the way the wind's blowing  yeah  well  winds can change   and you and i both know the injunction  will get overturned on appeal   i don't know anything of the kind   then why are you calling with an offer at all   as high as i'll go     okay  i'm hanging up now    20 million  that's it   the offer's good for 24 hours   and i'm sure i don't have to remind you  that you're legally required to present this to your client   is he free   not for you    how much did he tell you   he didn't have to tell me  i read it on his face     you heard him    maybe he did the same to me   get in there   and be careful   harvey   we talked about this  right  barging into my office   i'm not leaving until you hear me out     wanna bet    you owe it to me     oh  i owe it to you    yeah   look  this is not my fault  all right     louis made me do it    louis did  right   he put a gun to your head and made you smoke pot   yeah  he did  he pulled out the drug test    which i failed  by the way   and then he told me that if i didn't smoke pot  to help him land this new client  that he'd fire me    come on   it's not so different than asking someone  out for drinks  is it  you and i had a deal   i'm sorry    and if next time louis asks you to do something  that i told you not to do  what then   i told you that i did not have a choice   oh  because he had a gun to your head     yes    what are your choices  if someone puts a gun to your head   what are you talking about  you do what they say  or they shoot you  wrong   you take the gun  or you pull out a bigger one   or you call their bluff   or you do any one of  if you can't think for yourself   maybe you aren't cut out for this   no  i can and i am  look  i did what i had to do   i made the best out of a bad situation   which is what i am good at   which is what you hired me to do in the first place   yeah  i hired you and i expect your loyalty   so if louis asks you to do something like that   you come to me first  oh  right   like when i came to you and you told me  that i couldn't sit at the adult table  right   i remember that  or or when you told me  to go file the patent by myself  like that     excuse me    you know what   maybe it's time you showed me some loyalty   do you know how long it was  before i got to sit at the adult table   it was when i brought in my first client   which i don't recall you having done   and when you screwed up that patent  and wyatt went ape shit on me   i didn't put that on you  i took it on myself   because that's my job   and it's your job to do what i say when i say it   so if you're talking about loyalty   you better goddamn earn it   you're right   i said i'm sorry and i meant it   harvey     i want you to tr   i need you to trust me  okay   and i will work as long as i can   as hard as it takes to make that happen    i mean   you don't even have to pay me  all right   i'll work for free   for free   what  i meant   not forever   just as  like  a probationary thing   donna  tell wyatt i'm on my way over   do you never have to press a button   got it  and jessica wants to see  mike in her office right now   louis told me what you did at the club     i bet he didn't tell you the whole story   he told me enough to impress me   new business is hard   people will promise you the world  but until they sign that engagement letter   it means nothing   now i don't know what you told tom keller   but bring a client in at your age     that reminds me of harvey   jessica  before we get started   there's something in the retainer  that tom pointed out   it's not a big deal  really     we were just     no  no  no  no  no  no   like i said  we're here to make you happy   right   i thought you wanted nothing to do with him   i didn't  but then i thought about it   and he might not be a very good person   but a little deviousness  is the sort of thing you look for in a good lawyer   i mean  the other guy i was with  he was too nice   we were buddies  we went to school together   it's time i grew up  got a real shark   well  i had no intention  of being that way to get your business   that's exactly why i insisted that you be my point man   i want someone being devious for me   not to me     what    it's just     louis would've never told jessica that i existed   let alone that i helped him if you hadn't done that   hey  the way i see it  the three of us stick together   we'll make a pretty good team   you know  i got a better idea    20 million   they claim it's their final offer   that's what it cost to make the prototype   not to mention my entire savings and two years of my life   wyatt     they know we're stalled on our injunction   which means  to them  they're giving you a fair price  as an insurance policy against the risk of possibly  losing the interference claim   i don't care what it is to them   it's not fair   fair or not  it's their final offer   you think i should take it   i think you should tell them to shove it up their ass   ladies and gentlemen  i'm terribly sorry   but we have a problem   what problem   we came down here because you led us to believe  that your client was ready to accept  our settlement agreement  and i thought he would   look  i took him the offer   i presented it to him  and recommended that he take it   in fact  i urged him to take it   you know what he told me to do   he told me to tell you to shove it up your ass     now i know you didn't have me come all the way down here  just to tell me that   you're right  that's not all wyatt said   he said rather than spending years  fighting this out in court  in 48 hours  he's gonna put this online   that's a little rough  but you get the idea   what are you showing us  is this a website   available at the suntech domain name   all the design plans and calculations have been uploaded     is this online now    can be   which means the whole world will have access to my designs   they'll be ten knock offs of that phone  before you can catch a cab back to your headquarters     we could file an injunction    not before tomorrow   and once that technology is out there   good luck putting that genie back in the bottle   well  then we'll sue   but my client won't have any money   what he will have is credit for the initial design   which  after he incorporates under a different name   will be worth a hell of a lot more money  than the  20 million that you're offering   and you're saying that this was all your client's idea   yes   that's what i'm saying     thought you weren't coming   i had to settle a case first   you have the paperwork we talked about   what is this   it's a copy of the judicial conduct codes   a friend of mine works at the attorney general's office  gave it to me  we had a nice chat about you   i told him if you were willing to blackmail someone once   chances are you'd done it before   he's very anxious to meet you   you think you can get away with screwing my wife  and then have me investigated   you actually have it the wrong way around   the only thing i've done so far  is have you investigated   what   i never actually slept with lauren   but i knew you'd never believe me  so i kept my mouth shut   but now that she's getting a divorce   my policy no longer applies   and of course  she's free to date whoever she pleases   and she pleases me   enjoy your evening  donald   i've always heard about this place   which room is hoffa buried in    not sure  but     the arc of the covenant's just down the hall on the left   when you're finished down here   i'd like you to come upstairs  and start putting together a settlement memorandum     they went for it    thanks to your idea   well  i mean  it wasn't really my idea    they're settling for  okay  yeah  that was my idea   so does this mean i get to keep my job   i wanna talk to you about that     before you do  harvey     do we have to have  a conversation about how you keep interrupting me   um     look  sometimes when someone pulls a gun on you   instead of bullets it's filled with blanks   what's this   it's a copy of your drug test results   but this says i passed   you did   louis showed me a fake   i'm gonna go have a talk with him   you know what  why don't you let me do it   you think you're ready for the adult table   what  didn't you hear  i just landed my first client   why do you think i'm showing you this now  and not going straight to louis     go easy on him    nope    good boy   you lied   that other drug test you showed me was a fake   how'd you figure that out   someone once told me i have an eye for detail  when it comes to important paperwork   well  maybe you're not as good as you think you are   or you would've caught it sooner   okay  so this was all some sort of test   you blackmail me  you jeopardize my job   mike  stop  stop   we all came out ahead  didn't we   that new client's gonna bring us millions   jessica knows your name now    it's a win win   you're right   she does know my name   which is why she'll listen when i tell her  exactly what happened   okay  but before you do that  it is   that time again  isn't it   what time   pee in a cup time    oh   and now you know i'd fail   of course  you can run to mommy   tell her your story  and take your chances   or you can take the test and trust  that i'll keep it to myself as my way of thanking you       ah  you know  i actually did some reading  of the pearson harmon drug policy as well   it turns out that you have to wait three months  before you can request another drug test   see  it's a little detail that you might've missed   so  drink up   oh  and i spoke to tom keller   he says that he feels he'd be best served  with a combination of me and harvey   i think you'll get that call in the morning        sync  corrected by elderman
