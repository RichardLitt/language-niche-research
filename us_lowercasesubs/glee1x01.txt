   the willow tree      that i've been dreaming of     where's the coffee pot  figgins got rid of it   budget cuts   you know  i know for a fact that they are still getting hot java at carver   we should strike   hello  boys   who needs a pick me up   wow  lattes   yeah  i am a bit of a coffee snob   now  the key to a perfect latte   is in the temperature of the steamed milk   i like mine scalding   hi  emma   hey  ken   will  hi  hey   what's with all the lattes   oh  emma  i just felt so awful that figgins cut the coffee     a nutritionist for the cheerios   yeah  i heard you guys went  like    600 over budget on that   my performers didn't get on fox sports net  last year because they ate at bacon junction   since when are cheerleaders performers   your resentment is delicious   well  i have a phoner in a couple of minutes   it's an interview on the telephone with a major media outlet   i'll probably do it on my iphone   enjoy   thanks a lot  sue   i ssed you at the  uh  singles mixer last weekend  emma   yeah  i know   big pipe exploded in my building   it was wild  i hate those mixer things though   i mean  it's like a big meat market   it's just  ugh   i did give my number to a fireman though   but he hasn't called   you know what  there's someone out there for everyone   i wouldn't even sweat it   hey  did you hear that sandy ryerson got fired   really   well  who's going to take over glee club   don't know   i'd like to take over glee club   you want to captain the titanic  too   i think i can make it great again   there is no joy in these kids   they feel invisible   that's why every one of them has a myspace page    that's what i need to keep this program up   and you you expect me to pay it   i'm certainly not going to pay for it   we're not talking about cheerios here  will   they were on fox sports net last year   when glee club starts bringing that kind of prestige to the school again   you can have all the money you want   until then  60 bucks a month   and you've got to use the costumes and props you already have   but we need the stools for wood shop   hiding the  60 a mon fromy wife  terri  was going to be hard   but i had a bigger problem   how was i going to get these kids motivated   one thing i knew for sure  we needed a new name    new directions    my name is mercedes jones and i'm singing       r e s p e c t      find out what it means to me      r e s p e c t      take care  tcb       oh  hey  baby  yeah    hello  i'm kurt hummel     cellophane  mr  cellophane      should've been my name  mr  llophane      'cause you can look right through me      walk right by me      and never know i'm there      never even      know        i'm there     tina c    i kissed a girl      it's not what i'm used to      just wanna try you on      i'm curious for you      caught my attention      i kissed a girl      and i liked it       hi  my name is rachel berry   and i'll be singing  on my own   from the seminal broadway classic les miz   fantastic  let's hear it     on my own      pretending he's bid     you might laugh because every time i sign my name   i put a gold star after it   but it's a metaphor and metaphors are important   my gold stars are a metaphor for me being a star   and just so we're clear   i want to clear up that hateful rumor that i was the one who turned  that closet case sandy ryerson in  because he gave hank saunders the solo i deserved   that's cockpoopie   he was touching hank  caressing him   it was so wrong   i am not homophobic   in fact  i have two gay dads   see  i was born out of love   my two dads screened potential surrogates  based on beauty and iq   then they mixed their sperm together and used a turkey baster   to this day  we don't know which one is my real dad   which i think is pretty amazing   my dads spoiled me in the arts   i was given dance lessons  vocal lessons   anything to give me a competitive edge   you might think that all the boys in school would totally want to tap this   but my myspace schedule keeps me way too busy to date   i try to post a myspace video every day   just to keep my talent alive and growing     without him  the world       nowadays  being anonymous is worse than being poor   fame is the most important thing in our culture now   and if there's one thing i've learned   it's that no one's just gonna hand it to you     i love him      but every day      i'm learning      all my life      i've only been pretending      without me  his world will go on turning      a world that's full of happiness      that i have never known         i love him      i love him      i love him      but only on my      own       very nice  rachel   when do we start rehearsals     and i said to myself      sit down     said to myself  sit down      sit down  you're rocking the boat      i said to myself  sit down      said toimself  sit down  you're rocking the boat      and the devil will drag you under      by the sharp lapel of your checkered coat      sit down  sit down  sit down  sit down  sit down      you're rocking the boat  sit down  you're rocking      sit down  sit down  sit down  you're rocking the boat      sit down  you're rocking  sit down  sit down      sit down  you're rocking the boat      sit down         you're rocking      the boat       we suck   uh  it     it'll get there   we we just need to keep rehearsing   mr  schuester  do you have any idea  how ridiculous it is to give the lead solo in  sit down   you're rocking the boat  to a boy in a wheelchair   i think mr  shue  is using irony to enhance the performance   there is nothing ironic about show choir   rachel     rachel   that's sloppy   you're sloppy babies   it's just disgraceful   and i want the agony out of your eyes   uh uh  lance  don't you starcrying   you are the weak link  pal   how's it feel to be the weak link  huh    that can't feel very good   you changed out of your costume   i'm tired of being laughed at   you're the best kid in there  rachel   that comes with a price   look  i know i'm just a sophomore  but i can feel the clock ticking away   and i don't want to leave high school with nothing to show for it   you get great grades   you're a fantastic singer   everybody hates me   and you think glee club is going to ange that   being great at something is going to change it   being a part of something special mas you special  right   i need a male lead who can keep up with me vocally   maybe i can coach arty a little   look  mr  shue  i really appreciate what you're trying to do   but if you can't give me what i need  then i'm sorry   i'm not going to make a fool out of myself   i can't keep wasting my time with glee   it hurts too much   schuester   figgins wants you   but we just started rehearsals   my hands are tied  shue   i need the auditorium   alcoholics anonymous wants to rent it out for their afternoon meetings   lots of drunks in this town   they're paying me ten bucks a head   if we show at regionals  glee stays  if not  the bar's open     what is it with you and this club   you've got only five kids   one of them's a cripple   then  i guess you've got nothing to worry about   fine   yes   but you're running detention for free to make it up to me   deal   you put your hands in the corners like this   okay   i can't do it   i'm dyslexic   maybe i should just stick to towels and washcloths   howard  if you can't fold a fitted sheet   you cannot work at sheets n' things   associate to returns   go   make sure they have a receipt   someone looks beautiful today   hey  hi   you look very handsome   thank you   i just thought i'd bring you roast beef on pumpernickel    your favorite  aw   oh  but does it have mayo  yeah   will  if my diabetes comes back  i can't get pregnant   i     what is wrong with you   i just wanted to tell you that i'm going to have to start working late     i'm  uh  monitoring after school detention   what   i had to make a deal with figgins so he wouldn't kill glee club   but  will  i'm on my feet four hours a day three times a week here   now i have to go home   and i have to cook dinner for myself   this lady wants to return these sheets  but     something tells me we've got another bed wetter   do you see what i have to deal with here   god  hasn't she ever heard of a diaper   of course  towels have a thread count  mister     sheets n' things   what do you do   i read catalogues   i know these things   anything under a 400 thread count   and i could break out in impetigo   it's simple to understand   william   sandy   hey   well  hello   how are things   i hear you  have taken over glee club   yeah   i    hope you're not too upset   are you kidding   getting out of that swirling eddy of despair   best thing that ever happened to me   don't get me wrong   it wasn't easy at first being dismissed  and for what i was accused of   my long distance girlfriend in cleveland nearly broke  oh  god  don't you love a good monkey   took me weeks to get over my nervous breakdown   did they put you on medication   better  medical marijuana   it's genius   i just tell my dr  feelgood  i'm having trouble sleeping   and he gives me all of it i want   i'm finding the whole system quite lucrative   you're a drug dealer   oh  yeah    make five times more than when i was a teacher   i keep some for myself   and then i take money baths in the rest   who who do you sell it to   you want in   uh  no    i mean  i tried it once in college   but terri and i are trying to get pregnant  so     do my own packaging  and the first sample is free  sandy  no   come on  you are the one who are coaching those tone deaf  this looks like barf   okay   i have to do everything myself   call me   come

about joining glee club   well  i need more kids   performers    and all the best ones are in the cheerios   so i figured some of them might want to double up   okay  so what you're doing right now is called blurring the lines   high school is a caste system   kids fall into certain slots   your jocks and your popular kids up in the penthouse   the invibles and the kids playing live action  out in the forest  bottom floor   and    where do the glee kids lie   subbasement   sue's not wrong  but i don't think anything is set in stone   i mean  you know  kids are going to do what they think is cool   which is not always who they are   you just need to find a way to get them out of their boxes   well  how do i do that   they follow the leader   you know  if you can get a couple of the popular kids  to sign up  the rest will fall right in line   i just want to talk to them   i don't know  dude   i can't see any of my guys wanting to join     last month  they held down one of their teammates   shaved off his eyebrows just because he watched grey's anatomy   look  all i'm looking for is an introduction   fine   you got to put a good word in for me with emma   there you go  cinderella   thank you   i have trouble with things like that  the  um     the    the messy things   yeah   it's really nice how much you care about glee   about the kids   if you really care about these kids   you'll leave well enough alone   children like to know where they stand   so let your little glee kids have their little club   but don't pretend that any of them are something they're not   circle up   mr  schuester is going to talk to you   if you don't listen  you do laps   you mouth off  you do laps   got it   they're all yours  will   thanks  ken   hey  guys  how you doing   uh  i think i recognize some of you from spanish class  but   uh  i'm     i'm here today to talk to you about something different music  glee club needs guys   i'm going to put the sign up sheet at the door to the  so if anyone wants to sign up  please     thank you   dismissed   sorry about that  it's okay   you been sleeping okay   your eyes look a little bloodshot   i got allergies   okay  thanks a lot   new directions   i honestly thought that was the end  of the very brief fever dream that was  new directions      and even as i wander      i'm keeping you in sight      you're a candle in the window      on a cold  dark winter's night      and i'm getting closer      than i everhought i might      and i can't fight      this feeling anymore       i suddenly realized  why i had wanted to do this thing in the first place     what i started fighting for    it was seeing the gift in a kid that they didn't even know they had     and i can't fight this feeling anymore    it was pure talent     even if i have to crawl upon your floor      come crashing through your door      baby  i can't fight this feeling anymore     what i did then     was the blackest moment of my life   you want to tell me how long you've had a drug problem   i don't even know who the chronic lady is   look  if it were up to m we wouldn't have mandatory biweekly afternoon  but i've never seen that before  mr  shue  i swear   it's not mine   i'll pee in a cup   i'll pee  look  it     it wouldn't make any difference   possession is eight tenths of the law   i'm pretty sure that much pot is a felony  yeah   look  you'll get kicked out of school   you'll lose your football scholarship   wait  i    i had a football scholarship   to    to where   you could land in prison  son   oh  my god   please  don't tell my mom   look  i see a lot of myself in you  finn   i know what it's like to struggle to make good life choices   and i don't want to see you throw away everything you have     i just expected more out of you  finn   that really got to me when mr  schuester said that   because every day of my life  i expect more out of myself   see  i might look confident and everything   but i really struggle with the same thing others kids do   peer pressure  bacne   i never knew my dad   he died in iraq when we were fighting osama bin laden the first time   hold on  hold on  finn  finn  finn   please  i'm on the phone   i just want to trade next saturday's shift for this saturday   because finn's got a parents night for cub scouts   my mom and me  we're real close   but being a single parent can be hard   the only good time for mom was en we splurged a little bit  and ordered emerald dreams   darren was good to her   and he was cool about letting me hang out       you make me weak      and want to die      just when       that was the first time i really heard music     you said we'd try      lovin'      touchin'      squeezin'    man  it set my soul on fire     each other    you got a voice  buddy   seriously  if i had that voice  my band would still be together   stick with it   my mom took it real hard when darren left her  for that girl he met at pick   save     with someone else      lovin'  touchin'      squeezin'      each other      now it's your turn  girl  to cry      nah  nah  nah nah  nah nah       it was at that moment i decided to do whatever it took     make her feel all her sacrifice was worth it   we have two options here   i'm running detention now   so you can do six weeks after school   but that's gonna remain on your permanent record   what's the other option  mr  shue     i got chills      they're multiplyin'      and i'm losin' control      'cause the power you're supplyin'      it's electrifyin'       you better shape up    doo  doo
