brother   what you put this family through       johnston  for god's sake    now  he could have been     we could spend a week talking about what i could have been  all right     i've apologized  but i need my money to make a clean start    it's not your money   it's your grandfather's money     stay one more day    i've got to get back to san diego by tomorrow   all right  it looks like the explosion came from the west  maybe denver   did something happen   are we under attack   hi  dale  sorry i didn't call sooner  angel  but we     oh  my god  oh  my god   sheriff  robert hawkins   i am so sorry     i didn't know your mother was in denver    she wasn't in denver   she was in atlanta   oh  my god   look  i know you're telling people it was an accident  but if it was an attack  sheriff  and there's chaos out there   you might not want the wrong people knowing  that jericho is still here   it's the wrong bus   riley   get april  we'll meet you at the medical center   there's an empty prison bus out there     what's your name    heather   nice to meet you  jake     it's a great thing you did t there tonight    thanks   something happened in denver  atlanta   and it could be that we wake up  and we find out that's where it stopped   but  until we know   are we going to use our imaginations to solve problems  or to cause them      is there any sign of the sheriff  mr  hawkins    no  sir   i need to speak to your mayor   we got trouble coming   oh  my god   mom  where's april     jake  where have you been    where is she   she's down the hall     what's going on    get dad on the radio   you'll be fairly mobile on it   how do you feel   i feel like a badass     april  does the clinic have a fallout shelter    yes  what's going on   it's bad  come on   jericho has two underground shelters   one right here under the town hall  the other under the medical clinic  what about basements and storm cellars   they're better than nothing  but you've got to seal off the rest of the house  with  uh    duct tape  plastic sheeting   anything you can get your hands on   how do you know about radiation  mr  hawkins   because i was a cop in saint louis  and  after 9 11  we got up to speed   so our biggest problem could be the rain   won't the rain clear the radiation out of the air   yes  and bring it straight down on jericho    a direct  concentrated hit   anyone exposed too long     mr  mayor  sir   all right  look   we're gonna divide the town in two   everyone over here can go to the town hall shelter  all those on the north side will go to the clinic  we'll get the word out  dad     how long before the radiation gets here    oh  i'm new here   this is your town   how long does it normally take a storm to get here from denver     less than two hours    sounds right   two hours     we can't do that in two hours    not enough time   we've got work to do  guys   jake  and i used to play down here when we were kids   i don't think anyone's been down here in ten years     how many people can we fit in here    300   you do know that there's almost    eric    yeah   make sure all the people that have basements use them     we are not running out of room here today  you understand    got it  dad  jimmy   when was the last time someone was in here   you're kidding me   i can't put people in here   there's no air   there's no air in here   i hope the fan works   we got a lot of work to do   wait  wait  hey  hey   oh  thank god  i haven't seen anybody for hours   i ran out of gas     there's dead birds all over the road    yeah  we saw them

station nearby   well  what do you think it is     do you think it's an accident or       ma'am  we don't know yet   okay   did it come from wichita     because my fiance  he's flying in from      no  no  wrong direction   it looked more like denver   look  we need gas     do you know if there is a gas station nearby    uh    yeah  no   no  the pumps are     they don't work   they've all been abandoned   no  we could    we could try the richmond ranch     i think they might have gas there    then get in   we'll take you there   miss   it's  okay  get in   dale   wake up   wake up  angel

bomb went off yesterday    so   if i'm going to die in a nuclear blast  so be it   i'm going to be right here  playing pool with my buddies   but you're not going to die in a blast   you're going to get radiation poisoning   within the first couple of hours  you're going to be vomiting  and have crippling diarrhea   your hair is going to fall out in chunks   your skin   it's going to blister   your internal organs are going to start to shut down   because  well  frankly        they're being cooked from the inside   you're going to get sicker and sicker  until you can't move   and then you will die   over there on the floor by the pool table     with your buddies   ooh   don't mind me   sit tight   we'll be right back   sheriff  come in   come in  sheriff  over   randall  no one's heard

heard you were back in town    and i figured the one person who would know      i'm sorry   i have to go   if i see her  i'll tell her you're looking for her  but i'm sure she's fine   so we'll just  uh   use your pump and be on our way   stanley has the key   what did she just say   oh    her brother  stanley   he's got the key to the pump   wait a minute     she's deaf    yes   i read lips

that game   here's every book we have in the library about nuclear radiation     our friend the atom    some friend   anything in here for grownups   i'd like to know what we're supposed to do  if this town gets hit   none of the books are specific   atom bombs have only gone off in populated cities twice in history   and denver was probably hit by a hydrogen bomb  anyway   what's the difference   hydrogen bombs  they literally explode the air   so  what you're saying is that nobody knows  what's really coming   then we pick worst case scenario     what needs to be done    one second  sir  i have that   let me just     anything left outside will have to be scrubbed down   and if it rains  the top  will have to be removed before planting again   and tell everybody to cover all the water wells   that's about what it says  right   yes  yes  that's right   well  you heard the man   jeff  let's make sure all the ranchers get the livestock inside   i'm going to work on the
