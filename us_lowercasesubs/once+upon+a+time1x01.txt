in a prison   just like me  only worse   for your prison  all of our prisons  will be time   for time will stop   and we will be trapped someplace horrible   where everything we hold dear   everything we love will be ripped from us   while we suffer for all eternity   while the queen celebrates   victorious at last   no more happy endings   what can we do   we can't do anything   who can   that little thing growing inside your belly   next time i cut it off   the infant is our only hope   get the child to safety   get the child to safety   and on its    28th birthday   the child will return

almost      that clock hasn't moved in my whole life   time's frozen here   excuse me   the evil queen did it with her curse   she sent everyone from the enchanted forest here   hang on   an evil queen sent a bunch of fairy tale characters here   yeah  and now they're trapped   frozen in time  and stuck in storybrooke  maine    that's what you're going with   it's true   then why doesn't everybody just leave   they can't  if they try  bad things happen   henry   what are you doing here   is everything all right   i'm fine  archie   who is this   just someone trying to give him a ride home   oh  she's my mom  archie   oh  i see   do you know where he lives   uh  yeah  sure  just  uh  right up on mifflin street   the mayor's house is the biggest one on the block   you're the mayor's kid   uh  maybe   hey  where were you today  henry   'cause you missed our session   oh  well  i forgot to tell you  i went on a field trip   henry     what did i tell you about lying   giving in to one's dark side never accomplishes anything   okay   well  i really should be getting him home   yeah  sure   well  listen  um  have a good night   and  uh  you be good  henry   yeah   so that's your shrink   i'm not crazy  didn't say that   just    he doesn't seem cursed to me   maybe he's just trying to help you   he's the one who needs help  because he doesn't know   that he's a fairy tale character   none of them do   they don't remember who they are   convenient   all right  i'll play  who's he supposed to be   jiminy cricket   right  the lying thing   i thought your nose grew a little bit   i'm not pinocchio   of course you're not  'cause that would be ridiculous   i say  we fight   fighting is a bad idea   giving in to one's dark side never accomplishes anything   and how many wars has a clear conscience won   we need to take the queen out  before she can inflict her curse   can we even trust rumplestiltskin   i've sent my men into the forest   the animals are abuzz with the queen's plan   this is going to happen  unless we do something   there's no point  the future is written   no  i refuse to believe that   good can't just lose   maybe it can   no  no  not as long as we have each other   if you believe him about the curse   then you must believe him about our child   she will be the savior   what the hell is this   our only hope of saving that child   a tree  our fate rests on a tree   let's get back to the fighting thing   the tree is enchanted   if fashioned into a vessel  it can ward off any curse   geppetto  can you build such a thing   me and my boy   we can do it   this will work  we all must have faith   there is  however  a catch   the enchantment is indeed powerful   but all power has its limits   and this tree can protect only one   please don't take me back there   i have to  i'm sure your parents are worried sick about you   i don't have parents   just a mom  and she's evil   evil  that's a bit extreme  isn't it   she is  she doesn't love me  she only pretends to   kid  i'm sure that's not true   henry   oh  henry   ohh  are you okay   where have you been    what happened   i found my real mom   y you're henry's birth mother   hi   i'll just go and check on the lad   make sure he's all right   how would you like a glass  of the best apple cider you ever tasted   got anything stronger   how did he find me   no idea   when i adopted him  he was only 3 weeks old   the records were sealed   i was told the birth mother didn't want  to have any contact   you were told right   and the father   there was one   do i need to be worried about him   nope  he doesn't even know   do i need to be worried about you  ms  swan   absolutely not   madame mayor  you can relax   other than being a tired little boy   henry's fine   thank you  sheriff   i'm sorry he dragged you out of your life   i really don't know what's gotten into him   kid's having a rough time  it happens   you have to understand  ever since i became mayor   balancing things has been tricky   you have a job  i assume   uh  i keep busy  yeah   imagine having another one on top of it   that's being a single mom  so i push for order   am i strict   i suppose  but i do it for his own good   i want henry to excel in life   i don't think that makes me evil  do you   i'm sure he's just saying that  because of the fairy tale thing   what fairy tale thing   oh  you know  his book   how he thinks everyone's a cartoon character from it   like his shrink is jiminy cricket   i'm sorry  i really have no idea what you're talking about   you know what  it's none of my business   he's your kid   and i really should be heading back   of course   sneaky bastard      i don't want to do this   it has to be you   i'm not leaving you   it's the only way   you'll go in there   and you'll be safe from the curse   he said it would be on her 28th birthday   what's 28 years  when you have eternal love   i got faith   you will save me  as i did you   what is

really have any  he's kind of a loner   every kid has friends  did you check his computer   if he's close to someone  he'd be e mailing them   and you know this how   finding people is what i do  here's an idea   how about you guys let me out  and i'll help you find him   smart kid  he cleared his in box   i'm smart  too   a little hard disk recovery utility i like to use   i'm a bit more old fashioned in my techniques    pounding the pavement  knocking on doors   that sort of thing   you're on salary   i get paid for delivery   pounding the pavement is not a luxury that i get   huh  there's a receipt for a web site    whosyourmomma org   it's expensive   he has a credit card   he's 10   well  he used one   let's pull up a transaction record    mary margaret blanchard    who's mary margaret blanchard   henry's teacher   as we build our birdhouses  remember   what you're making is a home  not a cage   the bird is free and will do what it will   this is for them  not us   they're loyal creatures   ohh   wow   if you love them and they love you   they will always find you   we'll pick this up after recess  no running   why  thank you   ms  mills  what are you doing here

the woman who gave him up for adoption   you don't know anything about this  do you   no  unfortunately not   clever boy   i should never have given him that book   what in the hell is this book i keep hearing about   just some old stories i gave him   as you well know  henry is a special boy    so smart  so creative   and as you might be aware     lonely   he needed it   what he needs is a dose of reality   this is a waste of time   have a nice trip back to boston   sorry to bother you  no  it's     it's okay  i fear this is partially my fault   how's a book supposed to help   what do you think stories are for   these stories     the classics   there's a reason we all know them   they're a way for us to deal with our world   a world that doesn't always make sense   see  henry hasn't had the easiest life   yeah  she's kind of a hard ass   no  it's more than her   he's like any adopted child   he wrestles with that most basic question  they all inevitably face     why would anyone give me away    i am so sorry   i'm so sorry  i didn't mean in any way to judge you   it's okay   look  i gave the book to him because i wanted henry  to have the most important thing anyone can have     hope   believing in even the possibility  of a happy ending is a very powerful thing   you know where he is  don't you   you might want to check his castle   aah  aah  no   no  i can't     have this baby now   doc  please help me   it's gonna be okay   the wardrobe's almost finished  just  just hold on   it's ready   it's too late  we can't move her   push   aah   the wardrobe   it

you are  you're here because it's your destiny   you're gonna bring back the happy endings   can you cut it with the book crap   you don't have to be hostile  i know you like me  i can tell   you're just pushing me away because i make you feel guilty   it's okay   i know why you gave me away   you wanted to give me my best chance   how do you know that   it's the same reason snow white gave you away   listen to me  kid   i am not in any book   i'm a real person   and i'm no savior   you were right about one thing  though   i wanted you to have your best chance   but it's not with me   come

it's like with her  my life sucks   oh  you want to know what sucking is   being left abandoned on the side of a freeway   my parents didn't even bother to drop me off at a hospital   i ended up in the foster system  and i had a family until i was 3   but then they had their own kid  so they sent me back   look     your mom is trying her best   i know it's hard   and i know sometimes you think she doesn't love you   but at least she wants you   your parents didn't leave you on the side of the freeway   that's just where you came through   what   the wardrobe  when you went through the wardrobe   you appeared in the street   your parents were trying to save you from the curse   sure they were   come on  henry   no   no   no   no   no  no   no  no  no  no   please   please come back to me   what   oh  don't worry  dear   in a few moments  you won't remember you knew him   let alone loved him   why did you do this   because this is my happy ending   the child   gone   it was in the wardrobe  and then it was gone   it's nowhere to be found  where is she   she got away   you're going to lose   i know that now   good will always win   we'll see about that   where are we going   somewhere horrible   absolutely horrible   a place where the only happy ending will be mine   thank you   no problem   he seemed to have taken quite a shine to you   you know what's kinda crazy   yesterday was my birthday   and when i blew out the candle on this cupcake i bought myself   i actually made a wish  that i didn't have to be alone on my birthday   and then henry showed up   i hope there's no misunderstanding here   i'm sorry   don't mistake all this  as an invitation back into his life   oh   ms  swan  you made a decision ten years ago   and in the last decade  while you've been     well  who knows what you've been doing   i've changed every diaper   soothed every fever   endured every tantrum   you may have given birth to him  but he is my son   i was not    no  you don't get to speak  you don't get to do anything   you gave up that right when you tossed him away   do you know what a closed adoption is   it's what you asked for   you have no legal right to henry   and you're gonna be held to that   so i suggest you get in your car and you leave this town   because if you don't   i will destroy you if it is the last thing i do   good bye  ms  swan   do you love him   excuse me   henry   do you love him   of course i love him   you're out all night  and now you're going out again   i should've moved to boston   i'm sorry that my heart attack interfered with your plans  to sleep your way down the eastern seaboard   excuse me   i'd like a room   really   would you like a forest view or a square view   normally  there's an upgrade fee for the square   but
