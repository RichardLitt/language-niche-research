first time we met   that i was frighteningly honest   yeah  i esess i'm just wondering what the hell happened to that guy that  i liked from a couple summers ago   because this new one is an ass    but more than a histocacal snapshot of divisions  between class   a tale of two cities makes us  examine the morality in our own lives and the true meaning of sacrifice    thank you  naomi  that was     that was very well written   i can't believe you copied e e whole thing word for word   what did you think i was going to do   not that   maybe take some ideas  at least change it around a little

till the end of the day   i can't believe you told your daddy everything  are you kidding me   he recognized the paper  and mr  matthews could tell  too   what was i supposed to do   cry  threaten him  be creative   you sound like a spoiled brat   well  you sound like a little bitch   and just so we're clear  you're completely disinvited to my birthday party     'cause i care    oh  you should   did you see if wilson was crying   dude  shut up   dude  don't be such a puss  who cares about that puss   she wants to keep the cheating off her record   she writes me a new paper on a new book by

you did get to fly on a private jet   that makes you a winner  i am a loser   i stayed at the pit and drank coffee all night   loser   hey uh cool tattoo   what does it mean   it's the chiymbose s lfor friendship 'cause you know friends are cool   naomi has the same one   yeah   all right     in eighth grade my dad had an affair with my mom's best frid   i was     god i was so angry          butkn that she'd find out you know and she'd get a divorce or     start drinking again   so i     i didn't tell anybody i kept it a secret   but then it started eating away at me and i just     i had to tell someone   so     i told my best friend naomi   she promised me that she wouldn't tell anyone   so she told everyone   why why would she do that   because she needs to know more than anyone else   because it gives her power to tear people down   so     my mom found out   she confronted my dad and everything that i prayed wouldn't happen happened   so     now it is my greatest pleasure to make her pay for it   i'm sorry   adrianna     listen um how was the audition   oh it was great   really great   actually um it's between me and one other girl so keep you fingers crossed   wow i will

but it's nice to know we have another option   we do   and this thing with tracy i wish i knew what to do but i don't   and am i curious to know the kid's okay   absolutely but being an adoptive father would i want dixon's birth parents around us   no way   well look dixon is a teenager   this is a man   before you do anything about that   i think you really need to figure out how you want to handle things with try   i don't i don't kno and i am the first to admit that i was not the greatest guy back then   honestly i'm more concerned about the guy that you are now   so just take your time
