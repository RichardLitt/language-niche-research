move on   yeah   i'm sorry   i've been looking at this in my office all day   you bought a bike   yeah it's custom built it's from italy and allan is never getting his hands on it ever   i don't care if it costs  6 000   you bought allan a  6 000 bike   i i ordered it last year  it just arrived today     on his birthday   brutal   why don't you sell it   yeah  yeah maybe i will   or give it away just    great  exactly   i'm gonna give it away   hey  hey   you will not give allan that bike   i won't   will you be strong   yeah   strong   i i told my teacher there's probably no way you could do it but    do what   speak at my midwifery class   i told my teacher about naomi and  and she called you  a primal life giver     i i think i have something that night so    come on   do it   might give you a boost   i don't    i don't need boosting   i'm fine   i'll do it   i love talking to midwiffs   yeah actually i think   i thk we're   we're good on o b s but    oh i'm actually a double board certified uh neonatal surgeon   one of the best    in the world     with a specialty in genetics   d n a   uh well yeah maybe you know if um if someone drops out   you can't get more primal and life giving than d n a  dell   excuse me   uh do you still have time for that consult     the little girl    yeah   um please tell i'm reading that wrong   cooper asked for a second opinion but the genetic tests we ran confirm that  emily has a serious presentation of something called pelizaeus merzbacher disease   how do we cure it   well there's medication to treat the symptoms but there is no cure   so she's     not going to get better   ever   the drugs can give her five years maybe more     what    five year  five   i'm sorry   i know this is difficult to hear   and we will do everything that we can   wait you said that this was genetic   so one of us made her sick   no you can't think of it like that   because my sister she's trying to get pregnant   i mean could she have this too   we'll have to run some blood tests   we'll see which mutation you're carrying   it's important not only for your sister but also for you   if and when you should decide you want other children   no  emily   emily is all we need   excuse me  i'm looking for a dave walker   he came in with vomiting and severe dehydration   he was released 15 minutes ago   on whose orders   you don't release my patient without calling me   don't lecture me on medical etiquette   the vitals were normal we needed the bays and he wanted to leave   probably just had some 24 hour bug   well it didn't look like a bug   he was unconscious when i found him   he saiit was something he ate but he tested negative for e coli salmonella    that still leaves about a hundred other possibilities none of which require hospital stays   he was fine sam   besides grandma said she could handle it   the same grandma who couldn't call 9 1 1   that's why you don't release my patients without calling me   any word back about the little girl   yeah but the test results don't make any sense   sometimes they can be hard to read  let me see     this does not      no no   you see the     this doesn't make any sense   which mutation did the parentspass on to emily   none   well how is that possible   because they're not her parents   emily is ours  she's my baby   uh  there's the chance that this was human error    the hospital nursery wristbands fell off  got mixed up   there is also the possibility that someone may have done this on purpose   are  are you accusing us   i mean  you think that we wanted this   right now  all you have to do is take care of emily   and we'll find out what happened   i'm telling you  there is something wrong with this guy   we tell him his daughter's dying  he's cold as ice   we tell him he's not the father   he gets defensive right off the bat   people react to terrible news in different ways   it's his child  show some emotion   where did beth give birth   st  ambrose   oh  perfect     charlotte king's hospital    i'm going over there   no  you  you need to stay here and just calm down  we'll go   fine   where are those nursery records   there was no stolen baby reported   not in this hospital not while i was chief   well then two sets of parents went home with the wrong babies   i swear do you all take some kind of perverse pleasure in ruining my life   yeah there are switched babies out there but this is about us   this hospital has the best nurses in the city   neonate spent a fortune on security   did st ambrose institute nap time or do i still have a staff   then why don't you show us the records for the other babies  that were in the nursery the time that emily was there   will someone just br   thank you   there was only one other african american girl in the nursery at that time   who is it   this hospital spent 124 years building its reputation   i am not gonna ruin that by chatting with you   can you just give us the name   not until i talk to our attorneys   blood pressure 125 over 84     that's normal    yeah     i feel a lot better    okay   maybe a little shaky  what  what do you think it was   still not sure   just to be safe why don't you clean the kitchen top to bottom   it's not the food that got him sick   ma please   oh stevie  close the door honey   i'll leave it open  then the next time dad passes out no one's got to break a window to get in   hey stevie   is he okay   oh he's just bullheaded like his dad   what are you gonna do   and your mom   we're doing real good doc   things are good   so what am i missing   well in 90  of these cases it comes down to history and environment   oh well the environment's all messed up   the dad's drinking grandma's got way more than she can handle the kid's acting out   that sounds a lot more serious than a 24 hour flu   see that's why i'm worried   they've got enough to deal with as is   and if david's got something really serious i'm not sure how they hold it together     hey coop    hey     ginger   i didn't recognize you in     i didn't recognize you   tell me that is not the girl from last night   cooper's bringing 'em to work now   oh my god  that's it   he has just crossed the line   sam just hugged a stripper   god at least with cooper you know what you have   okay now let's all calm down   sam is not a dog  he never was   now there could be a totally innocent explanation for this   what  what  what for stripper hugging   give me one  give me one   well     like she's here to see the real dog   oh would  would you look at him   he's all     i'm a doctor my touch heals   can i talk to you     i spoke to our attorneys    and   some days i really hate the hippocratic oath   here   here's the file on the second african american baby in the hospital nursery   you're just giving it to us just like that   if you think i'm being nice read the name   oh god   what   and my problem becomes your problem   melinda and duncan stinson   you know them   i got them pregnant   what do you think of your handiwork naomi   oh she is so cute   and if you tell me i've got more hormone's to take i'm gonna scream   oh no  no no no   it's just uh we need to run some blood tests on all of you   what's going on   so how are you holding up   i'll be better when we find out who did this   all your nurses check out   one moved a few days later but her record was impeccable   well something happened in that nursery   you don't know that   that doesn't stop you from tossing the blame my way   i know that if one of my patients was in this much pain i would be busting my ass looking for answers   thank you   i hadn't gotten my earful of oceanside arrogance today   look at him   how is that guy and the guy who hired me a stripper the same person   he's cooper   so this other couple     their baby was born the same night   that's right   we're  we're running blood tests on them now   what if the other blood tests come back positive   this is the hard part   acrding to california law     you would     say good bye to emily     and you would welcome a new child into your lives   that's  that's ridiculous  okay   the blood tests are not gonna come back positive  and i don't care what our blood tests said     honey honey    no no   i know emily is my daughter okay   a mother can feel these things   i don't love that other child   i couldn't love another baby   i lo emily   well why don't we just wait for the results of the blood test and go from there   emily's had a hard time now she has to adjust to a whole new family   well the babies are young   you know adoptions take place at this age all the time   the kids are usually fine   it's the parents i'm worried about   they're the ones who grieve   greg o'brien doesn't seem to be grieving   what is up with you and this case   your emotional attachment is huge   you're one to lecture me about unhealthy emotional attachments   okay that was a nice deflection   but unlike you i am detaching   you want to try it   it's yours   light   why didn't allan buy his own bike   on our third anniversary you know we took that trip to italy   and he took me to the town where they made those because even as a child he had  he'd wanted one   so he saved up his money     but then his dad split on his mom   so he had to use his savings to pay rent and to keep his mom afloat   and he never got the bike   what  what   take the bike  you love it   yeah i loved it when i thought it was a cool sexy  get me laid  bike   not some sad allan y  cat's in the cradle  bike   hey   is that stripper still in your office   entertainer not stripper and yes   and she's been in there all day  why   we're trying a few different techniques   oh yeah i'm sure you are   you know what   naomi does not need ginger thrown in her face   naomi is a big girl  she can handle it   she doesn't have to  that's why i'm here   pete is it supposed to feel tingly    pete is it supposed to feel    you know what   go go do    take care of your poor little stripper girl and her  tingly   entertainer and why are you so angry at me     you  i    cooper's the one that set this    you know i am trying to take care of my friend   and cooper is bad but you're worse   and you know why  because you're slippery yeah   you walk around pretending to be all soulful but you don't take the heat   you just do whatever you want to do and you evade   evade evade evade   do you need me to kiss you again   no   okay   you're back   nurses' schedules     perinatal testing personnel files   what'd you find   not a damn thing   i have been through every one of these backwards and forwards   you're so sure my hospital ruined these people's lives then help me prove it   please  someone hurry   help me   please   sam  sam front   hey  hey  help     please help me    yeah ma'am it's all right     sam    stevie what's going on   whatever my dad had     i got it worse   i got home   grandma made dad and me some sandwiches then   pukeville   mrs walker what did i tell you about that kitchen   well it was just a ndwich   that could've killed him   where is your father   at  at work   i didn't want to bother him with this   mrs walker i understand you mean well for your family   but something you are doing is making them sick   this is a family matter doctor   it doesn't concern you   hey dell can you hand carry stevie walker's blood to the lab for me   put a rush on it   have them screen for ingestible poisons   hey  i just got the test back from the stinsons   the o'brien baby is their baby   and the stinson baby belongs to the o'briens   yep   how do you tell someone that their baby was switched with another baby   damn it   well that was the hardest thing i've ever done   you did everything right   and dad doesn't shed a tear   how's it going with naomi   well you know so far so    do you know what you put my wife through   what you put us through   and now you tell us that this  this other baby who we've never met is sick   we did everything you asked us to do   i know how hard you two worked to get pregnant   let down after let down the  the miscarriages the hormones     you how many shots i had to stick in her   she could hardly move she was so bruised   i i wish there was something i could do   yeah there is something you can do   you can start by explaining how you   how you can live with yourself    taking our money and promising us a healthy baby   duncan i never promised you perfection   i promised you a child   my retirement vacation pay   our future   we spent it all so we could have our little girl   duncan please   i want my money back   i want my damn money back   your husband     he has a right to be angry   so do you   i could just take sarah and go   we could just go away   no one would find us   except you won't   because emily is your daughter   and she is sick   and a mother never leaves her child behind   not a strong mother   no  no   this isn't happening   i'm not gonna do it   come on baby   hey   stevie walker's lab results   coprine   from the mushroom   ink cap mushrooms contain coprine   it's like a natural form of antabuse   when you ingest the mushroom then if you drink alcohol you get really    really really sick   so someone's poisoning stevie   any luck   well i think we know when the switch happened   we have baby emily'shospital record and baby sarah's hospital records   and then on day two they switched   emily becomes sarah and sarah becomes emily   what about this nurse left town   no she was in the e r  of my hospital   laid out with the flu hooked up to an i v all night   so we're back to square one   my patient is being poisoned by his own dear sweet mother   she's dosing him with ink cap mushrooms   which means he's drinking   boom on the floor     baby switch    poisoning   for real  baby    hi  you are not a member of this practice   so you have to go ahead and unhear that   i thought i had a problem   yeah well maybe we can help you with yours since we're not getting anywhere   i i don't know   i i gotta stop the mother from hurting her son   now she's also poisoning her grandson   but i can't send her to jail can i   how could a parent do that to a child   let me see the visitor's log again   yeah   the first two days one person was there constantly   a parent     did that to a child   what you're doing is a crime   you can't go around poisoning people   no i only meant it for david   i didn't know stevie was drinking   so it's okay to poison your own son   well every time he takes a drink he pays for it   at's how you teach my david a lesson   you have to stop doing this now   no   my family we're weak when it comes to this   david's not weak   he's an alcoholic   and some old world remedy will not guarantee that he'll stop drinking   now i'm a doctor and i'm telling you    what  you     you're like all the other doctors   oh you make him go to a 12 step group   but do you make him stop drinking   no  so i did   please   you can't tell david   this will work   as david's doctor i can't let it happen   i'm sorry   then you might as well have me arrested   because i don't know how long i've got   and my family means everything   if i don't protect them who will   from birth your baby   your biological baby   well it was difficult   she had a neurological problem   she did   your c section caused severe post labor pain   so you were sedated for most of the first two days   you wouldn't have been aware of how serious it was   but you were mr stinson   you were in the nursery 24 7   and then when your daughter was 2 days old she seized while you were holding her   what are you saying   what   what are you saying  i    she's saying that the next time you were in the nursery alone is when those babies were switched   you were the only one there   it would've been easy enough to switch off your baby's security bracelet  because she was so small   no i'm not gonna stand for this   if i were that baby's father    mr  stinson people's lives have been altered   your child's life   you were supposed to take care of her and instead you switched her  because she was sick   mr stinson i i think this is your opportunity to explain to us    no no no you explain   you explain   all my wife's hopes and dreams     oh my god   melinda th this other family they can have more kids healthy kids   you see   duncan     wait this isn't   i'm not a    melinda honey     how could you give my baby to somebody else   how could you        makes it okay for you to steal a child   adults are there to protect children   we're supposed to keep them from harm   you're angry at yourself   what   i'm talking about duncan stinson what he did   i'm angry about that   right  before that it was greg o'ien   but it's really about you   don't     do the shrink thing violet   you can't blame yourself for not being able to make her better cooper   she's just a baby   dave we're here because you have a problem with alcohol   a problem   no     maybe i have a glass of wine or a beer     dave   once twice a week maybe i drink more than i should   we need to get you into a treatment program   why   because i like beer   come on   i don't need treatment   dave   sorry   all right well you should know that i figured out why you've been getting sick   uh you've developed an allergy   to alcohol   what  that's not possible   well it's rare   yeah it's  it's really rare   and it probably runs in the family   so i mean you've seen what happens when you drink   that's gonna happen every single time   so i     i have to stop drinking   yeah you do   that's my diagnosis   now if you continue to get sick   then i'm going to have to consider that it's something much more serious   gloria you're gonna help dave make sure that never happens not even once   oh yes yes   he  well he   he's learned his lesson   come in   would you like to sit down   i think it might be helpful for us to talk about what happened   your husband     is not my husband anymore   that other little girl     your daughter   she's so sick that she could die   yes   before she's 5 years old   yes   melinda     this is emily   this is mama   this is emily   i don't um   this is a mistake   i can't   i i thought it would feel like    listen listen listen   it is natural that you would feel like a stranger at first   it'll get better   she's uh she's so small   the condition she has it's caused a failure to thrive   she's so beautiful   i know   i sing her to sleep   sarah likes     it's gonna sound stupid but uh i sing madonna songs to her  'cause they're the only ones i know all the words to   but they work   she goes to sleep so easy   emily screams     every two hours   but if i     put her on my chest the sound of my heartbeat     your heartbeat     it calms her   sarah is beautiful too     look at her   no i can't   i   i can't   you have to   she's yours   a mother never leaves her child behind   hi   hi sarah   i thought     i couldn't watch her die   and now i can't     let her go   i'll get you a tissue   i'm fine   it's okay  it's     it's been a big day   montgomery     i'm chief to over 200 physicians   you call this a big day   this place is making you soft   god     i am a wreck   long day   we just sent a man to jail for trying to get rid of his own kid but     your day sounds really hard   i didn't know   no of course not   you spent e entire day dealing with the perils of aromatherapy and uh your stripper   i know you don't believe me but i like my women real     real skin     real breasts     real lines arountheir eyes that mean they've really lived and had pain   you show me that woman     and i'm interested   and   not in a slippery way   and addison     i think it's great that you try to care of naomi   but     who takes care of you   no ginger   she can't be her  ginger cannot be her   okay   you're gonna have to translate from freaked out language to normal people language   the first woman you date after me has to be     she has to  look she cannot be some stripper with clear platform shoes and    and a suspicious skin condition   naomi eventually i'm going to start dating   i know that   and when that happens you do not get to have a say in who i date   i know that   so     so fine date   but it can't be ginger   and we're back to crazy   hey you know what  i'm a catch   i i do  the new york times'  crossword puzzle in pen i eat vegetables   i have a very good sense of humor and i don't do pilates 'cause i think it's fun   i mean have you seen me   if you date ginger after you're with me if she is what you are choosing   if  if your big dream is rashy skinned strippers then what       what were you     what was i doing with you   yeah you know what   forget it   the next girl i date will be amazing   she will be beautiful she will be intelligent and she will be rash free   she'll be better than me   she will be way better than you   okay   okay   that's sweet  thank you   vye open up   i think i might need to borrow some tools
