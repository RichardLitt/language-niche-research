   1  gerald tate's here   he wants to know what's happening to his deal   go get harvey      sync  corrected by elderman     i check   raise    i'm all in   you can pay me later  i got to go   gentlemen   i'm paying you millions   and you're telling me i'm gonna get screwed   jessica  have i come at a bad time   gerald  this is harvey specter   he's our best closer   well  if you're the best closer   where the hell you been for the last three hours   well  gerald  i specialize in troubled situations   and when i left here at 7 00 p m    this deal wasn't in jeopardy   so i'm just trying to figure out what happened in the interim   we keep offering more money   they keep rejecting it   it's last minute bad faith bullshit   says here that cooper won't be staying on  as honorary vice president   that's right  i don't want him around   he wouldn't be around   it's an honorary position   i don't give a shit   well  i think you do   because that's what's changed since i left   which means it's you who's been dealing in bad faith   well  now that you've got a grasp on what's happened  in the goddamn interim   what are you gonna do about it   because he's not getting that title   well  let me make sure i understand this  okay   we negotiated a deal that gave you everything you wanted   mr  cooper signed it  and now you won't close  until we take away the last shred of his dignity     bingo    well  that's not gonna happen     and why the hell not    because i like mr  cooper   and my firm doesn't operate in bad faith   oh  i see how it is   instead of working cooper   you're working me   well  why don't you take your pansy attitude  back in there and make him sign my deal   or i'll pay someone else your money  to do it for me  first of all  gerald   if you think anyone's gonna touch this deal  after your bad faith  you're mistaken   second  the way our agreement works is   the minute cooper signed the deal  which gave you everything you wanted   our fee was due and payable  which is why at 7 30  i received confirmation of a wire transfer  from escrow indicating payment in full   so i'd say the ball's in your court   but the truth is your balls are in my fist   now i apologize if that image is too pansy for you   but i'm comfortable enough with my manhood  to put it out there   now get your ass in there  and close the goddamn deal   you gonna let him talk to me like this   harvey speaks for the firm   we got paid before gerald signed the deal   what are you talking about  this is a memo  about some fire drill on tuesday     huh    you're the blue team captain   you get to wear a fire hat   time's up   pencils down   excuse me  do i know you from somewhere   i don't think so   i have a pretty good memory for faces   so do i     sorry    i got it   hey  hey   stop  you in the cap       suits 1x01     pilot original air date on june 23  2011  what did you get me   what i said i was gonna get you   a 158  i told you i wanted a 175   and i told you only 1 out of 100 people  can score that   you're a b minus student  you got 1 000 on your sats   if i get you a 175  they'll know you cheated   so only a genius loser can get a 175   actually  no  i would get a 180   now can i have my money  please   whoa  this is only half   then why don't you go call the police   i got to get my shit together   that's the best cheeseburger i've had in my life   it's from monday  trevor   look  man  i'm serious   i almost got caught today   i've got to stop getting stoned   i've got to get my act together   dude  look at me   you can burn bud and still be a success   you sell pot for a living   still saps the motivation   all i'm saying is  you want in   you are in   you know  that is word for word  your offer before i got caught  cheating on your math test in the third grade   goddamn memory   stop   look  no one's gonna suspect you're a dealer   i mean  look at me   this is a  2 000 suit  mike   i got  like  12 of 'em   i take on real software projects   i have clients who bring me briefcases filled with cash   and i hand them identical briefcases  with vacuum sealed bud   so what do you need me for   well  i have a client coming in from out of town   and i can't meet him   and i need someone i can trust to make the drop   it's totally safe   trevor  a person is more likely to die  while dealing drugs than they would be  on death row in texas   wait  what are you talking about   it's from freakonomics   do you read anything that i give you   it doesn't matter   because you have to find somebody else   i'm not interested   not interested in what   what are you doing here  you said you were gonna stay  at your place tonight   hi  sweetie   what a pleasant surprise   i'm so glad you stopped by  yeah   we're in the middle of something   what are you in the middle of   trevor's trying to set me up   that's terrific   who's the lucky girl   i'm trying to get him to work for me   that's a great idea   it will take some stress off trevor   and you'll pick up writing code  like you do everything else   all right  i got to go   i got go get up early to see my grandmother  and pay them another month   oh     good night    bye   how did you know gerald wouldn't look at that memo   because a charging bull always looks at the red cape   not at the man with the sword   by the way  i've set up a meeting  for you and john dockery next week   dockery  he's skadden's biggest client   not anymore   he's looking around   he plays tennis  i want you to close him   consider it done   then you are officially dismissed  for the evening   cheers   well  you two seem to be celebrating something   mm hmm  we are   in fact  you are looking  at the best closer this city has ever seen   closer  huh   baseball  attorney   i close situations   hmm  so you only care about money   the truth is  i do it for the children   i'm lisa   harvey   lisa  i don't normally do this   but since we are celebrating   what time do you get off tonight   i'm glad you asked   i get off at ten past  i'm never going out with you    i guess you're not the best closer this city's ever seen            good morning   lisa  this was lovely   but i'm afraid you have to go     aw    i hate to miss a workout   and i really need to be in the office by 7 30   i can make you breakfast   you could eat it off my stomach   i guess if i skip the gym   i can still get in by 9 00   i hear someone's not taking their pills   because they're trying to poison me   grammy  that's crazy   dr  shrager gave me her word  she wouldn't poison you until january   if she does it before then  she can't count it  towards next year's quota   oh  what did i teach you   michael  i'm not gonna be around forever   and i want you to stop with that stuff   what stuff   i may be old   but i'm not an idiot   i know life has been hard for you   but you're not a kid anymore   and i want you to promise  you're gonna start living up to your potential   i promise   i'm not saying that i haven't been charmed by harvey   but it's just so patronizing  when you say that he can handle those things  and   louis  you can only handle this    jessica  i could have handled gerald tate   and i told you i disagree     why    because when you put  two bullies in the same room together   things generally don't go so well   it's 9 30  nice of you to show up  two hours after we open for business   and i see that you're also trying to look like a pimp   my bad  louis  i was out late last night   and when i woke up  this is the suit  your wife picked out for me   and that would be funny  if i'd actually been married  moving along     you're not married    recruiting  harvey   your interviews are set up for tomorrow   what  why don't we just hire  the harvard summer associate douche   i think if you listen to the phrasing  of that question  you'll come up with an answer   we need people who think on their feet   not another clone with a rod up his ass   harvey  the fact that we only hire from harvard  gives us a cache that's a little more valuable  than hiring a kid from rutgers   you went to harvard law   i'm an exception   find me another one   can we please skip the recruiting   i work better alone anyway   well  i would  harvey   except all senior partners get an associate   it's just a rule   i'm sorry  what   jessica  i deserve that promotion   my billables destroy his   and i'm here night and day doing whatever's needed  instead of swanning in and out of here  whenever i please   i must admit  he does make me sound very swan like   harvey   shut up   louis  this is how it is   all right  now you two make nice   louis  i apologize  i was out of line   now if you'll just let me text your pretend wife  that i just made senior partner  i  what   your grandmother's getting worse   i need to move her to full care  or i'll have to transfer her to the state facility   i won't put her in a state facility   then i'm afraid you'll have to come up with  25 000   trevor  i'm in   one time deal  i want 25   take it or leave it   i'll take it   there's a briefcase in my room   pick it up tomorrow   take it to room 2412  at the chilton hotel   now you can't go to a luxury hotel  looking like a delivery guy  so shave   comb your hair  buy a suit   that's a hell of a lot to ask  man   well  i'm not asking you  i'm paying you  25 000   okay   yeah  he's in   good   i'm gonna go take a piss   key    if this new buyer's a cop   why didn't you tell trevor he might be sending  his guy into a setup   same reason why i don't tell gina  i'm banging her sister   it'll only cause trouble   what's up   i'm just gonna take off   i don't think you should   why don't you stay with us till tomorrow   now give me your cell phone   give me your phone   don't even think about warning your boy   'cause if these guys are cops  whoever's holding that weed  is going to jail for a long time   hey   hey  god  you scared the hell out of me   sorry   look at you   you look great  thanks   tell me you decided to work with trevor   yeah  trial basis  yeah   what are you doing here   my mom is coming by my place later   and i don't want to mess it up   so i'm hanging here   got to go   hey  come here   mm   you want to look perfect on your first day   yeah   i've got to go   mm hmm   great  thanks   donna  we're gonna need to streamline this   give each guy a hard time   before you send them back   give me a wink if they say something clever   cool  okay   what are you looking for   another me   so  chip   what makes you think  that i'm gonna let the whitest man  that i have ever seen interview for our firm   because i have an appointment   hmm   you can do this   kid  what is wrong with you   you look like you're 11 years old   i was late to puberty   harvey specter   uh  excuse me   i was thinking about going for a swim   are the pool facilities here nice   of course  sir   this is the chilton hotel   and do you have the time   yes  uh     thanks     he saw your gun    you think that's him   matches the description   but he didn't go in the room   it's 10 00 exactly  he's just walking by   go after him  stay on the radio   rick sorkin   rick sorkin   rick sorkin   excuse me  mr  sorkin   you are five minutes late   is there a reason why i should let you in   look  i'm just trying to ditch the cops  okay   i don't really care if you let me in or not   mr  specter will be right with you   what   can i get you anything  a coffee or a bottle of water   hi  rick sorkin   harvey specter  nice to meet you   why don't you have a seat here   whoa  what's this   can i help you   no   how the hell did you know they were the police   i read this novel in elementary school   and it was the exact same thing   you read a novel in elementary school   what  i like to read   and why'd you ask them what time it was   throw 'em off   what kind of drug dealer  asks a cop what time it is  when he's got a briefcase full of pot  right   we should hire you   jesus  i'd give you the 25 grand  as a signing bonus   i'll take it   unfortunately   we only hire from harvard   and you not only did not go to harvard law school   you haven't even gone to any law school   what if i told you that i consume knowledge  like no one you've ever met   and i've actually passed the bar   i'd say you're full of crap   that's a barbri legal handbook right there  right   open it up  read me something   anything    civil liability associated with agency is based  on several factors     including the deviation   of the agent from his path    the reasonable inference of agency on behalf   of the plaintiff  and the nature  of the damages themselves    how did you know that   i learned it when i studied for the bar   okay  hotshot   fire up this laptop   i'm gonna show you  what a harvard attorney can do   pick a topic   stock option backdating   although backdating options is legal   violations arise related to disclosures  under irc section 409a   you forgot about sarbanes oxley   the statute of limitations  renders sarbanes oxley moot post 2007   not if you can find actions  to cover up the violation  as established in the sixth circuit  may 2008   that's impressive  but you're sitting at a computer   playing hearts   sorry  if you want to beat me   you're gonna have to do it at something else   how can you know all that   i told you  i like to read   and once i read something  i understand it   and once i understand it  i never forget it   why take the bar   this dickhead bet me i couldn't pass it  without going to law school   okay  look   this is all pretty fascinating stuff   but i'm afraid i got to get back to work   i'll make sure that serpico isn't around  waiting for you   you want this job so much   why didn't you just go to law school   when i was in college   it was my dream to be a lawyer   i needed some money   and trevor convinced me  to memorize this math test  and to sell it   turns out we sold it to the dean's daughter   i lost my scholarship  i got kicked out of school   i     i got knocked into a different life   and i have been wishing for a way back ever since   let me tell you something   this isn't elementary school  this is hard work   long hours  high pressure   i need a grown goddamn man   you give me this   and i will work as hard as it takes  to school those harvard douches  and become the best lawyer you have ever seen   i'm inclined to give you a shot   but what if i decide to go another way   i'd say that's fair   sometimes i like to hang out with people  who aren't that bright  you know   just to see how the other half lives   move over   i'm emailing the firm i just found our next associate   all right  you're gonna start a week  from monday   here's what you're gonna do   first  no more pot  we drug test   stop smoking now  you'll be fine   i assume that's all the drugs you do     how do you know that    you read books  i read people   and potheads smoke pot  that's what they do   it's not all i do  i have interests   you're albert friggin' einstein   and you couldn't manage to get into law school   you think that's not from smoking weed     trevor got     that's another thing   you're never gonna talk to trevor again   you're gonna ditch that briefcase   and you're gonna get on a plane to harvard   and you're gonna learn everything there is  about going to law school there     did you buy that suit    yeah   let's buy some new ones   hi   how do i sign up for today's law school tour   you go back in time six weeks  because that's when it booked up   um     this is harvard law   we get over 7 000 applications a year   you think you can just walk in and take a tour   thank you   eduardo fernandez  who  first of all   looks like he works at the public pool or something   and he comes up to me the other day   and i completely know he's a freshman   and he looks at me and he goes    where's the public health school    which is right around the corner   and you know what i tell him  clifford watkins   excuse me   can i help you   jonathan atwater   i work for dean wormer in the admissions office   yes  of course  what can i do for you   well  the dean personally sent me down here  to invite you to a small cocktail hour  for some of our more realistic candidates   and we'd like to keep this sort of thing discreet   so if you'd subtly hand me your name tag   you can proceed directly to the dean's office   congratulations   harvard law is the oldest law school  in the country and boasts  the most successful graduates in the world   currently  we are six of nine supreme court justices  and  of course  the president of the united states   uh  hi  good morning   i'm here to see   have a seat   thank you   mike ross   hi  i'm rachel zane   i'll be giving you your orientation     wow  you're pretty    good  you've hit on me   we can get it out of the way that i am not interested   no  i'm sorry  i wasn't hitting on you   trust me   i've given dozens of these   and without fail  whatever new hotshot it is  thinks that  because i'm just a paralegal   that i will somehow be blown away  by his dazzling degree   let me assure you  i won't   i was  i was hitting on you   you were  take notes   i'm not gonna repeat myself   i love you   the firm operates on a chain of command model   harvey's your commanding officer   however  louis litt  he oversees all associates   so you'll also answer to him   what do you think about harvey   people are in awe of him   they say he's the best closer there is   but i have very little contact with him   so i don't know   and what about louis litt   let's continue with your tour   hey  becky  you are glowing   i wonder why that is  oh  yeah   it's the day they announce my promotion   jimmy  have you lost weight   steve o   looking like a guy who came to work   excuse me  why are you scratching off  the senior off my door   i got a work order to take it off     who issued the work order    my supervisor   why did he issue the work order   if i knew that  i'd be his supervisor   you seem to be enjoying yourself   i haven't enjoyed myself since 2004   donna   someone's trying to have a little fun with me here   jessica wants to see you in her office   now   and finally  this is where you'll live   wow   i gave you that for a reason  you haven't taken one note     that's because     because you were  too busy ogling me to listen  to a word i've said   partners' offices anchor the wings   fifth floor's research  sixth is security   all work gets billed  even if it's finding an address   i answer to harvey  and louis litt  and  judging by the way  you responded to my questions   i should admire harvey and i should fear louis   you have been here for five years   and just because i outrank you  does not mean i have the authority  to command your services   oh  it's also pretty clear  that you think you're too smart  to be a paralegal   you know what nobody likes   nobody likes a showoff   you used the word  ogling    when do i get to see harvey   gerald tate fired the firm   so you're taking my promotion away   you know  most firms would put you in front of the bar  and have your license stripped   you lied to a client  and he figured it out   i lied to him to get him to do the right thing  and honor his goddamn contract   and you didn't seem to mind so much  when you thought i got away with it   but you didn't get away with it   and i can't justify handing you a promotion  on the same day that you lose a huge client   one client doesn't make a firm   i don't know if you've noticed   but we're in the middle of an economic meltdown   companies aren't exactly lining up  to spend money on attorneys right now   and  you know  gerald might have forgiven the lying  had you not humiliated him   but you did  and you need to accept that   jessica  if you hadn't done as much for me as you have   i'd be heading for the door   if i hadn't done as much for you as i have   i'd be throwing you out the window   but  harvey  no more shenanigans   you do one more thing that isn't straight as an arrow   and instead of covering your ass   i will put you in front of the bar myself     mike    hey   who's ready for a great first day   i'm gonna have to let you go     what    i just got reamed  for lying to a client   and if they find out that i lied about you  going to harvard  they'll take away my license   you what   not now  donna   look  i have to put my own interests  above yours  it's nothing personal   you're fired   wait  so you're worried that if i stay   then they might find out that you lied about me  and you'll lose your license   but if you fire me  then i could tell them  that you lied about me   and you'd definitely lose your license   are you telling me that  if i throw you under the bus   you're gonna drag me with you   you put your interests above mine   and i'm just putting mine back up next to yours   you're rehired   so should i   all right   here's what's gonna happen  you're gonna give me back  my promotion  and that's the last  we're gonna talk about this   and why is that   because if you don't  i'm gonna go across town  and join rick peterson   i'm gonna approach every client i've ever closed   and i'm gonna take them with me   you do that  and you'll force me  to put you in front of the ethics board     i don't think you will    and why not   because you were obligated to notify them  the second i lied to gerald  but you didn't   you put me in front of the board right now   i'll put you right up there with me   hmm   i'll   i'll give you your promotion   but you have to do something for me   anything   ah  pro bono   anything but that   harvey  pro bono cases  are how we  as a firm  show that we care  about more than just ourselves   i'm not saying we shouldn't do them   i'm saying i shouldn't do them   and it's how you can show me  that you care about more than just yourself   you'll handle this yourself   you will not pass it off   absolutely   your first case   awesome  what is it   pro bono   sexual harassment   don't tell anyone i laid it off on you   and don't screw it up  got it   you can't handle it  i'll knock it out of the park   easy  clarence thomas  just go meet the client   hey  didn't i tell you to get some better suits   i spent  500   for how many suits   five   what   nancy     mike    yeah  hi   you're a kid   no  i'm a   i'm a grown man   you're so skinny  have a grape   thank you   why don't you tell me your story   it started two years ago   i was a stay at home mom  to my son  freddie   and one day we were at little league   freddie was five   he really hated that he couldn't play  with the older kids   it was the third inning  and i got a phone call   my husband had been in a car accident   and he was gone  just like that   i'm so sorry   i did the best i could   i got myself a job as a secretary  at devlin mcgreggor   and i even got promoted  to secretary of the president   charles hunt   and that's when it all changed   it's okay  tell me what happened   he started asking me to stay late   order in dinners together  stuff like that   one night  he says that if i sleep with him   he's gonna take care of me in the firm   and  if i don't  he's gonna fire me   so what did you do   i went to human resources   they said they investigated   couldn't find anything to support my claim   two months later  i was fired  for poor job performance   they wouldn't let me say good bye to anybody   they wouldn't write me a letter of recommendation   i wasn't looking for a payoff   all i wanted was for it to stop   can you help me   uh  yes   yes  i can   what do you need my help for     wait  can i just     no  give me the update   you know  she's a nice woman   she   on the case   i don't get emotionally attached  to the client   this woman had her life ripped apart   you don't even care   i'm not about caring  i'm about winning   why can't you be about both   i'd explain it to you   but then i'd have to care about you   what are you doing   don't touch that   i'm just checking my lock   you ride your bike to     it's locked  okay   come on   defense sent over the investigation files  as a courtesy  no  they didn't   nobody does anything as a courtesy   they sent those files  because that's where they want you to look   listen  being a lawyer's  like being a doctor   you mean how you don't get emotional about the client   no  i mean you keep pressing until it hurts   then you know where to look   forget about impeaching the investigation   it won't lead anywhere  no employee's gonna testify  against their own ceo  okay   so what do you suggest i do   think  this guy's done this once     he's done it before   and if the people who work for him now  won't testify against him     someone who used to work for him might   you know what   i'd subpoena the personnel records  of every woman who's left the firm  during this guy's tenure  that's funny   that's exactly what i thought   then what do you need my help for   i don't know how to fill out a subpoena   figure it out yourself   donna  can you show me how to fill out a subpoena   absolutely  and after that   you want me to show you how to wipe your ass   it's funny  because you should already know  how to do both those things   ha  yeah  that's hilarious   what's that  that's my suit guy   go in  tell him i sent you  and spend some money   what does it matter how much money i spend on suits   people respond to how we're dressed   so like it or not  this is what you have to do   that's weird  you giving me advice   it sounds like you actually care about me   i don't  you're a reflection of me   and i absolutely care about me   so get your skinny tie out of my face and get to work   that was a little harsh   really   yeah   mike   where are you going   it's 6 30  i'm going home   okay  what's so funny   you're a rookie associate   if you go home before 9 00 on your first week   you're not gonna make it through your first month   and louis litt wants to see you     hey  can i ask you something    mm hmm   this tie  is it too skinny   yeah   right   yeah   i know you had orientation from rachel   but i wanted to give you a special welcome from me   amongst other things  i'm sort of the disciplinarian  of the associates     you wanted to see me    yes   gary  please come in  mike  this is gary lipsky   gary's one of our most promising associates from last year

like  the third time i've had to ask   i'll get right on it   don't bother  you're fired   what  you can't fire me   oh  yes  i can  and i just did   go pack up your things   don't you ever show your face in this place again   see  i arranged for you to see that  because we pay our associates very well  and we provide the opportunity for unlimited advancement   but in return we expect results   have i made myself clear   yeah   great   welcome to pearson hardman   feel free to go back to work   harvey   okay  i have two words for you   absolutely beautiful   you think you're the only one who can charm a client   categorically stunning   how's the new kid working out   regally hot     you're an idiot    jessica pearson   good night  harvey   what are you doing here   watching sportscenter   boo yah   you won't return my phone calls   ah  yeah  because you set me up   do you remember that  you think i knew about that   here we go  round 50 of i get the shaft  because you didn't know the whole story   you knew there were risks when you quoted that crap  from that book   okay  you needed money   and i came through with an opportunity  like always   besides  you weren't the only one who got screwed   they pulled a gun on me   oh  really   and why did they do that   to keep me from warning you   so you did know   well  not until after it was too late   well  it's too late now   look  let me make it up to you   oh  you want to make it up to me   give me my key back   michael   come on   you know i don't want to live in a world  where we're not tight   then kill yourself   get out   get the hell out   donna  i need the    oh  also i didn't have a chance to    marry me  i took care of that too   we've been married for the last seven years   excellent   umm  devlin mcgreggor's fighting the subpoena   they filed a motion to dismiss the case  based on our lack of evidence     good    good   wait  what do you mean   good    they don't want to hand over the files   you pressed where it hurt   you're looking in the right place   did you think they wouldn't fight back   well  i   now that you mention it   oh  my bad   i keep forgetting  you don't actually know anything   the idea is   you make a move  they make a move   you go back and forth until one of you wins   okay  what if they win the motion  and the case gets dismissed   you're not as good as you think you are   harvey  what a coincidence   i was wondering how the pro bono was coming   i'm all over it   that makes me very happy   because if i were to find out  that you weren't putting in your full effort   i'd be very upset   no worries  we're all good   rachel  rachel  rachel  rachel  i need your help   there's a hearing on my subpoena   i've got three cases in front of you   so you're gonna have to wait in line   no  no  no  no   my hearing is tomorrow   so why are you coming to me   because donna says  you're the best researcher in the firm   let me see the motion   whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa   you have an office   how do you have an office and i have a cubicle   like you said  i'm the best researcher  in the firm  really   i just made that up   i didn't even have time to talk to donna   is this all a joke to you   'cause i take my job seriously   no  i'm sorry   look  i was    look  you weren't there  okay   i care about this woman   she's got nowhere else to turn    and you can't help her by yourself   i can   i just prefer not to   okay   you're asking to look at private files  without any evidence of your assertion   yeah  but the only way that we can find  the evidence is to look at those files   it's a rickety argument   but is there a precedent   let's go see if we can find one   research is as much art as science   so we're gonna look at privacy and harassment law  so you can find a combination of cases  to make an argument  i'll take privacy   i'll take harassment law   this'll take a while   we're gonna need dinner     chinese    no   i can afford chinese on my own   this is on the firm  i want sushi   ooh   so they told me to put my top investigator on it     what did you do    what could i do   you were out of the country  i gave them luderman   by the way  that dress     what  this old thing  come on   beautiful   vanessa  why don't we do this more often   'cause it always ends the same way   then why are we doing it now   harvey  i don't sleep around   and i could never be in a relationship with you   all you ever think about is yourself   i'm thinking about you and me right now   please  i insist   but i'm a gentleman   besides  you came through  on dockery for me  and i'm not one  to forget a favor   neither am i   mr  dockery  you naughty  naughty boy   you remember when i said you thought you were too smart  to be a paralegal  mm hmm     why      aren't i a lawyer   mm   i don't test well  what   i am smart   and i know i'd be a good lawyer   i just  i don't know what it is   i can't take tests   and i bombed the lsats   and even if i could get  into law school  there's no way  i'd pass the bar   so if only there was someone who could take the test for me     yeah  if only there were    yeah   hi  where are you at with the research  for tomorrow's hearing  nothing yet   you say you care about the client   but if you keep playing footsie  instead of finding me an argument   the client's gonna lose   i don't want to lose   ugh   look  it's no use   okay  their investigation's by the book   we look like the bad guys coming in   putting them under duress   what did you just say   i said we look like the bad guys   no  you said  they did it by the book  and we're putting them under duress   yeah     look    hmm   this is good  we're gonna have some fun   we  i get to go   you didn't think i'd let you come along     no    good instinct  i wasn't   but then i thought it'd be cruel  not to let you witness my greatness     okay  can i go get my bag    no     you're a true giver    other side   okay   your honor  this case should be thrown out   other than her story  the plaintiff doesn't have  one piece of evidence   because the evidence lies within their personnel files   which they're conveniently refusing to hand over   those files contain sensitive information   he's fishing at the expense  of our employees' right to privacy   please  they don't give a rat's ass  about his employees' right to privacy   sorry  that's actually unfair to rats' asses   your honor  mr  specter's claim that we don't care  about our employees  though belittling   doesn't carry any weight as a rule of law   true  but what does carry weight is that an investigation  of sexual harassment must be conducted  without any duress   your point   the investigator and every person  being interviewed answers to the ceo  they're investigating   that is the definition of duress   it'd be as if your bailiff  accused you of sexual harassment  and you assigned your stenographer  to investigate   now how likely would it be  that this investigation yielded any fruit   you honestly think i would harass herman   well  i don't know  your honor   some people have a thing for the uniform   ugh  i'd like to think herman would come to me  before it even got to an investigation   i saw that  that should be stricken   but what if herman did come to you  your honor   and you betrayed his trust  by firing him under false pretenses   you really think that little of me   i wouldn't trust you as far as i could throw you   your honor   hand over the files       oh     today   that's it   herman  i'd like to speak to you in chambers   that was awesome   it was your argument   i just framed it in a way  that humanized the situation  and brightened all of our afternoons   i feel like michael corleone in that scene  where that fat guy teaches him how to shoot that gun   are you saying that i'm the fat guy   'cause i'm not the fat guy   mm   you know what his name was     yeah    cordoza     clemenza    i knew that   i was just testing to see if you knew it   i knew that you knew that i knew            train wreck   hey  i'm looking  for rene   i'm rene  i'm sorry   we don't sell skinny jeans at this location   did harvey tell you i was coming  or      harvey specter sent you   that's another story   do you know your inseam   i don't  it's probably a medium   oh  why don't you browse for a while   these are the most exclusive   and we move down in price  as you head to the door   oh  okay   large   that's not how it works   huh   so trevor's getting you to do his dirty work for him  huh   all i know is you aren't talking to each other   i miss you   i want things  to go back to the way they were   i miss you too  but     i'm not sure things are ever going back  to the way they were   i gotta go   what did he say   he said things aren't ever going back  to the way they were   what did you do   i don't know   hey   so the files are on their way   we won   that's fantastic   so now we have a week  to corroborate nancy's story   listen  i couldn't have done it without you   you wouldn't even know where to look without me   you know what nobody likes   nobody likes a showoff   hello   yeah  he's here   okay  thank you   files are in conference room c   why wouldn't they bring them to my cubicle   they're trying to bury you in paperwork   well  they picked the wrong guy   if they didn't  i did   get it done by the end of the week   i got to run and charm our new client   nice to finally meet you   jessica says you're gonna sweep me off my feet   i'll do my best  mr  dockery   you got a nice serve there   working on it   what the hell is this   it's you having sex with a woman  who isn't mrs  dockery   are you trying to blackmail me   you asked my firm where you're vulnerable  to corporate takeover   that's it right there   what are you pulling here   your wife owns 10   of the company's voting shares   you've been seeing this woman and several others  for quite some time   how do you think your wife's gonna vote  after she finds out  who says she has to find out   my investigator got these within a week   what do you think a motivated competitor's  gonna dig up in a year   i have a solution   trade her your preferred shares   which have no voting rights   for her common shares  which do   the preferred shares are worth  2 million more   a fraction of what you'll lose  if you get voted out of your company   john  i don't care if you sleep  with every woman in the hamptons   just give her the preferred shares   jessica said you were gonna charm me to get my business   i'm not interested in getting your business   i'm interested in keeping it   i know where they don't want us to look   did you get through all those files in one night   i would have done it faster   but i ordered a pizza   speaking of which  have you ever had  the cheese in the crust   because it blew my mind  what'd you find   there was a dismissal on march 12th  2005   but the file with the employee name on it is missing   it's our woman  i know it is   i'm moving to slap sanctions  on their attorney  possible jail time   guy's not gonna know what hit him   dennis  it's harvey specter   did you have anything to do with the march 12  2005 files  left out of discovery   if they're here by noon  i'll believe you   if not  we're filing for sanctions   threat of sanctions is better than filing for sanctions   that's what i meant  threaten  not file   who would mean that   shave   have you ever heard of this woman   joanna webster   no  why   the company's trying to hide her from us   you think hunt did the same thing to her  that he did to me  yes   then you have to make her come forward and say so   yeah  that's the plan   thank you   joanna webster   can i help you   hi  my name's mike ross   i'm a   i'm a lawyer   i have some questions for you  about your time at devlin mcgreggor   please  look  just let me tell you a story  about my client  okay   fine  just a second   mr  ross   what happened to me happened six years ago   it was horrible   and there was a reason i didn't do anything  about it   they'll put me on that stand  and attack me  and i don't want that   ms  webster  joanna   this man is a predator   and if you don't help stop him  he will do it again   all you have to do is give a deposition   i'm sorry   i can't do it   what happened with the witness   uh  i failed     to not be awesome   i got her to testify   you should have seen me  i tried everything   he'd do it again   i'd be with her every step of the way     nothing worked   and then it hit me   i asked her what if it was her daughter  that he did this to   she melted   and you know how i came up with that little gem   i cared about her  oh   yeah   thank you   i'm glad to see that staying up all night  doesn't make you act like a complete idiot   go home and get some sleep   i don't want you waving that thing around  during tomorrow's deposition   harvey   how's the pro bono going   great  i just talked a witness into testifying   really  what's the witness's name   i'm not an idiot   don't treat me like one   you pawned off the case   jessica  i've got higher profile cases    need i remind you that when we first met   you were a screw up   i gave you a shot at the mail room   led you up the ranks  and then paid for you to go to harvard   where  by the way  you jerked off the entire time  you were there  and i still hired you   and you've benefited from that ever since   look  i closed the dockery case  okay   you made a promise to me   you broke it  and then you lied to my face   so let me be clear  this isn't professional   this is personal   and i'll tell you something else   you made your bed  you better goddamn win   god damn it   what the hell is wrong with you  i need the briefcase back   oh  so that's what this has been about  huh   you don't care about our friendship at all   you're my oldest friend  and you know it   but you don't seem to care about that anymore   and  yeah  i need the briefcase back   and i'm gonna find it  mike   well  i ditched it when i was running away  from the cops that you sent me into   mike   where you

and i asked him if he knew you   it's so funny  he didn't   well  what's his name   mitch samberg   yeah  don't know him   it's a big school   not really   we get 7 000 applications a year   you think you can just walk in and take a tour   oh  mitchell   with the slicked back hair   graduated seventh in the class   sure  yeah  i remember him   time to face the music   yeah  what's up   i got to get to the kendrick filing   where the hell is mike   i don't know   leave the cup on the counter   you'll have to leave that out here     why    if you take it in there  with you  i have to check to make sure you don't have  another urine sample in it     where you been    hi  um     getting drug tested  actually   the deposition's this afternoon   before they get here  i want you to grill this woman  about her background for anything they might use  against her   you got it  got it     make her tell you everything    everything     everything    everything     okay    okay   i had been working six months  when mr  hunt started asking me to work more   order dinner   one night  late  he tried to have sex with me   the next day  i requested a change in assignment   two months later i was fired for having a bad attitude   this is ridiculous   wipe that smirk off your face   you're not even supposed to be here   mr  hunt has every right to be here   now  ms  webster  after working for devlin mcgreggor   you then went on to waitress at hooters  right     yes  i did    a place that advertises  the sexuality of its waitstaff  correct   you will have to ask them that   i'm asking you   and she's not answering  move on   ms  webster  would you say that you're a truthful person   yes   so when you said earlier that you had never been arrested  for a crime  you were speaking the truth     yes    yes  so in 1993 then  you were not arrested for stealing  1 000 worth of jewelry  from the willow grove mall in pennsylvania   i was 17  that was one mistake   those records were supposed to be sealed   so when you say those records were sealed   what you mean to say is you thought  you could get away with a lie   no  that's not it   you're making it seem different that it is   i'm sorry  you were arrested in your past  and you lied about it here under oath   is that making it seem different  than what it is   no answer  hmm  all right   let me ask you this  since you've lied here once   what's to make us believe you're not lying about mr  hunt   how the hell did you miss that arrest   i did every background check we have   did you grill her like i told you to   it was a sealed record  harvey   goddamn it  i knew it   fix it   joanna  wait  please   this is why i didn't want to testify   they twist something from 100 years ago  and make me look like a liar   they make it sound like what he did  to me didn't happen   it doesn't matter  all right   i just  i need you to testify on friday  and keep this case alive   we don't have time to find anyone else before    would you please wait   no  i'm not waiting   you promised this wouldn't happen  and it did   you never told me you were arrested   don't contact me again  please   what happened with the witness   nothing  nothing happened  i couldn't fix it   so you're going to quit   it's either that or have louis litt fire me   what are you talking about   my first day  louis fired gary lipsky  for screwing up a case   he said if i did the same thing  i'd be gone just as fast   well  you go back to the witness' house  and you get her to testify again     i tried  there's no way    there's always a way   then why don't you go and convince her   because you screwed it up   oh  and you don't give a damn about the client  right     that's not my job    does your job  include giving a damn about me   because the least you could do is offer  to stand up to louis for me  stand up for you   i put my ass on the line for you   but it turns out you may have had the balls  to get this job  but you don't have the courage  to stick it out when it gets tough     that's not true    isn't it   you've had one foot out the door  since you got here  what are you talking about   i'm talking about that briefcase  being locked in your desk  yeah  i saw it   and i know what it is   it's your backup plan in case this doesn't work out   you can make some quick cash and go right back  to the life you told me you didn't want to lead   so if you want to quit  go ahead   but this isn't because of louis  and it isn't because of me   it's because you're afraid you might have to admit  that you're not as smart as you think you are   if you're here in the morning   i'll know i still have an associate   hey  i get that you were upset  that i was promoted before you   but if you ever threaten to fire one of my guys again   i am going to kick your ass   hmm  what are you talking about   don't play dumb with me  all right   you fired gary lipsky in front of mike ross   what's so funny   gary lipsky works in the mail room     what    i didn't fire anyone   that's how i let the new associates know  what's expected of them   you plant a fake employee to manipulate the assoc    that's it   what   michael   i want to quit   come here   when your parents died   i lost my son and my daughter in law   i was scared  alone  and i was too old to raise you   but i had no choice   because who else was going to care of my grandson   you made me a promise before   you're in the door   promise me now the only way you'll leave  is if they rip you out   you can save your breath   there's no way i'm testifying  at the hearing tomorrow   that's not why i'm here     i know what you did    what are you talking about   you never worked for devlin mcgreggor   and you were never harassed by mr  hunt     that's a l     now i could tell you  that i've got the canceled checks or the wire transfer  or whatever smoking gun that exists  i don't   but i will  and when i do   you'll be going to jail unless you tell me  what happened right now   i'm the guy you tell   all i had to do was waste your time until tomorrow  after the hearing   please  i just needed the money   i don't want to go to jail   here's what you're gonna do     did you call this place before   mike     hey    i'm not giving this to you  because you need it   i'm giving it to you because i don't   and i don't know if i'm ready to forgive you yet or not   but i do know we're even   wait a second   i     well     don't   now we're even   huh   i see you came to work today  nice suit   it was a barter transaction   i got six of them for one little briefcase   listen     i'm sorry and    forget it   when i first started  jessica rode me so hard     i quit once a month   i just told you what you needed to hear   that's just it  i've only ever had one person  who told me what i needed to hear   maybe it's time i started trusting somebody else   merry christmas   is this for real   you know what to do   press until it hurts   wire transfer from your account to joanna webster's   phone records with joanna webster  prior to her testimony   and an affidavit stating you paid ms  webster  to falsely testify   mr  hunt  harassment is a civil violation   the penalty is money   but witness tampering  that's a crime   and you will go to prison   where i guarantee you'll learn  more about unwanted sexual advances  than you can possibly imagine   do you think this is going to intimidate me   even if this evidence was credible   who are you going to get to prosecute  a small time witness tampering charge  huh   harvey  didn't you graduate law school  with the current u s  attorney in new york   in fact  i did   and i think he might even be interested  in pursuing a case like this   wait  are you two still close   well  i was the best man at his wedding     wow    no  you weren't   you're bluffing   no   i think i've got some pictures     of us at the ceremony   let's see   yeah  here we are   you must admit  i look very dashing   this is me and his mother   the woman adores me   here we are at his bachelor party   there's no strippers  it was lame   but he can't put guys like you away for sexual harassment  and then go to strip clubs  now  can he   all right  what do you want   an admission of guilt and a guarantee  that you'll obtain treatment before working again   and nancy gets reinstated with back pay     fine    and a raise   okay  all right   are we done   the kid should be able to grow up without the burden  of tuition hanging over his head  don't you think   which is why you're also gonna pay nancy  an extra  250 000   charles   gentlemen   thank you for everything   you're welcome   so just one question   why'd you go to joanna's house   because i figured it out   i object   i think you did it because you care   i did it because it's my job   would you admit it  you care about me   i saw you smile when i showed up for work this morning   i didn't smile  i was thinking of a funny joke   look  we start on this tomorrow   does this mean we're officially a team now   i wouldn't move your things into wayne manor just yet     so now you're batman    closer to him than clemenza     oh  yeah  kilmer    clooney   keaton   did you really quit when you first started   of course not  i'm not a wuss      sync  corrected by elderman
