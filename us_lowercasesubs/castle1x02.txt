  i wanna get in trouble      i wanna start a fight      na na na na na na na      i wanna start a fight    mr  castle  be advised  if you get injured following detective beckett to research your novel   you cannot sue the city   if you get shot  you cannot sue the city   if you get killed   my lifeless remains cannot sue the city   your heirs  mr  castle   do i have to wait for him to sign  or can i shoot him now   mr  castle  these waivers are serious business   perhaps you'd feel mo comfortable  by referring the matter to your attorney   what  are you kidding  he'd never let me sign these   but fortunately  it's his job to get me out of trouble  and not to prevent me from getting into it   beckett   yeah  where   all right  i'm on my way  whoa  wait  uh  where are you going   i have work to do  what  we have a case   no  i have a case  you have paperwork   so  mrs  rosenberg  9 e here   comes down to put her clothes in the dryer   finds it's occupied   comes down a half an hour later and she's had enough   decides to take matters into her own hands   come on  you're telling me that  an old lady killed someone over a busy dryer   what  no  she's just tired of waitin' around   so she opens up the dryer  to take the otheperson's clothes out   finds miss fluff and fold here instead   now if that's not a cautionary tale  about poking around someone else's laundry   i don't know what is  dude  there is an etiquette involved   if the clothes were dry   mrs  rosenberg had every right to put 'em in the basket   now if you're gonna tell me that she folded 'em   then it gets a little creepy  i'm sorry  someone starts rootin' around my underwear  without an invitation   i'm taking that as a serious breach of hygiene   i thought you went commando  esposito   well    seasonal thing   all right  let's get her out of there with some dignity   and we need c s u  to come down here  and the bleach bottle  will have to go down to the lab   and probably prints and photographs   although i don't know  if it's gonna do us much good in a public area   i'm guessing she lived here   worked  12 f  she's the nanny   thought you ditched me back at the precinct  didn't you   come on  nanny mcdead is found on spin dry   you don't think the captain's gonna let me in on that story   you're right  castle   my bad    exactly how much longer do i have to expect you  toe shadowing me on my cases like this   hard to say  when i'm writing a new character   there's no telling when inspiration might strike  i thought i was your inspiration   oh  you are  detective  and in so many ways   yeah  well  your inspiration might strike you  sooner than you think   nanny's name was sara manning   she worked for the petersons about two years   the doorman is a huge fan of my work   mrs  peterson   detective kate bkett  nypd   i was wondering if i could ask you  some questions about sara manning  of course  please come in   thank you   richard castle  just n y      http                    2                                    sweetie  mommy and daddy need to talk to some people   but we'll be right out here   we still haven't told him what happened   we just don't know how   sara was very close with him   she just had  has a a gift with kids  you know   she was such a lovely girl   i'm very sor  the school called me at my office  when sara didn't come to pick up justin   i i tried her cell phone   but it went straight to voice mail   then i tried here  but the machine picked up   so i hopped in a cab and went to the school   when we got home  the police were already here   when was the last time you saw sara   my husband saw her last night when he got home   we take justin to school every morning   so we're usually gone by the time she gets here   and what time is that   today it would have been 11 00   sara straightens up  does justin's laundry  and then picks him up from school about 2 00   one of us then home for dinner   last night it was my husband's turn  so then you were the last one to see sara   i i guess so  did she mention any problems she was having   uh  maybe a boyfriend  sara's boyfriend   the  the doorman said  th the police told them that it was a break in   which usually means a stranger did it  we can't be sure what happened   well  maybe not  but statistically speaking   much greater likelihood that it was someone she knew  oh  my god   again  we can't be certain who was involved   but she had a boyfriend  brent  but they broke up   and when was that  about a month ago  but sara never said there was any trouble  or anything like that  brent  that was his name   yes  do you know his last name   uh  i don't think sara ever mentioned it  not to me  either   thank you both so much for your time   of course   castle  let's go  but  that's it   that's it   oh  do you know of any way i could reach sara's parents   oh  god  i hadn't even thought of that   i i'm sorry  we don't have their number   yeah  they live in atlanta  she was with them over christmas   what about sara's things  there's her bag and her jacket   maybe i could take it and check her cell phone   why couldn't wstick around  i had a lot mo questions   because i actually like to investigate things myself first   besides  neither of them is going anywhere   well  there's no cell phone in here  maybe it's in the laundry room or in the dryer   well  if it is  c s u  will find it   she's still got her georgia license   are you really the one who has to call her parents   easier to write about than to live through  huh  castle   three men huddled around a computer   that better not be porn  and if it is  i want in   esposito and ryan pulled security tape  from an elevator in the rear entrance  front door has a 24 hour doorman   this is the elevator's cam   our victim gets on the elevator with the laundry basket   takes it down to the basement   puts the kid's clothes in the washer   a few minutes later  gets back on   goes all the way back up to the apartment   then about 40 minutes later  rides the elevator back down  to the basement again  weigure probably to take the kid's clothes  out of the washer  put 'em in the dryer  camera never picks her up again   only other person to ride the elevator down all the way  to the basement during the next hour was the old lady  who found the body  so whoever attacked her must have used the stairwell   otherwise the camera would have got him  we got three maintenance workers on duty that day   we'll run their names tonight  why only run the workers' names   why not run all the neighbors' names   what are you basing that on   i'm basing that on     the neighbor would make a better story   no  come on  at do any of us know  about our neighbors in this city   you think the guy living next door to the son of sam knew he was living next door to the son of sam   he's right  neighbors in berkowitz's building  had no idea he was the son of sam killer   thank you  what about the guy in 8 b   who    you see him every day  only you never notice him   but he noticed sara   she's young  beautiful   the kind of girl that a guy like him  would never have a chance with   we all know girls like that  don't we   well  at first it's just a game  figure out her schedule   when does she do her laundry  when is she alone   until it becomes something more   something that he can't control   well  he uses the stairs  obviously   to avoid the elevator's cameras   and then he just waits   concealed in the shadows   when she comes into that laundry room   he pounces   when he looked into her vacant  lifeless eyes   he wanted to tell her he never meant to kill her   all he ever wanted was to be noticed   that's when he felt the heat of that dryer on his skin   so he picks up her limp body in his arms  and gently places it inside   he almost smiled at his good fortune  when he found the quarter in his pocket   slipping it into the slot   buying him the time to do what he does best     disappear   just saying  bter story  coffee   let's see what we can find out about those neighbors   and someone better tell me who the hell lives in 8 b   let me guess  gran cooked   chicken masala  and where is hurricane martha   in her room taking a dramatic pause   leaving the mess for everyone else to clean up  as usual  i don't mind  dinner was fun   well  it's our room  not hers     just remember   even despite that hideous bedspread she bought   if you're hungry  there are lots of leftovers   oh  thank you  i grabbed a slice on the way home   you really are turning into a cop   yeah  do you think   so who got killed today   the nanny   do they know who did it  well  apparently in an actual homicide   they don't know who did it until after the guy gets caught   how come we never had a nanny  well  your mother and i decided  if someone was gonna screw you up  we wanted it to be me   only you managed to turn out fine somehow anyway  surprisingly   is that the prodigal son i hear   returned from working the night shift   you catch any perps today  kiddo   i did an  nypd blue  once  remember  you were the crazy homeless woman   and some might say still are   i was just asking dad  how come we never had a nanny when i was little   i spared her any stories of my own personal experience   i had a real job as a working actress   you know  not everybody can sit at home  in front of a laptop and claim to be employed   really  you had a nanny   yeah  only we didn't call 'em nannies then  what were they called   oh  i don't know  um    alcoholics   raving lunatics  no  no  no  wait   uh  completely irresponsible middle aged women who   instead of looking after me  while you were acting  like they were supposed to   instead watched daytime television  oh  stop your whining  you didn't turn out half bad   and don't forget  the good half are my genes  well  that's just something  we'll have to take your word for  isn't it   but i'm not asking for an apology  mother   actually  i got the plot of my first novel     by watching  one life to live   there you go   detective beckett  did you miss me already   which means i am one quarter responsible  for your success as well  really  do they do those at night  no  for sure   i'm just  i'm just touched that you thought of me   oh  ordered to call me  i see   well  either way  i  uh  can leave right away   okay  gotta go   i would say don't wait up  but you'll be asleep by 11 00    ah  well  you will help her with the dishes   all right  be careful    flatfoot   here  put these on   really   i thought cops just stood around the body  eating ham sandwiches and crackin' jokes    you know  hard core gallows humor   the head trauma definitely contributed to the death   the force of the blows  resulted in significant cerebral hemorrhaging   mr  castle  nice to see you again   i wish i could say the same  but my glasses are all scratchy   how often do they let you replace these  not everybody has your budget  castle   so what killed her  i'd say she was struck in the head with the bleach bottle   then fell forward  hit her temple on the edge of the table   that caused temporal bleeding   without medical attention  she didn't stand a chance   but what i thought you might find really interesting  is the fact that she had sex  hours before her death   sex  i'll explain how that works later   might have even been within a few minutes of the murder   the heat from the dryer makes it hard to pinpoint  so you're saying she was raped   hard to determine  there were no vaginal lacerations  or presence of any semen  so what's the evidence of sex   traces of spermicide  the guy wore a condom   boy  it really has been a long time for you  hasn't it   i mean  it could have been a rape   but myest guess is   she knew the guy   without evidence of trauma   i'm not ready to buy our attacker as a sexual predator   especially with him using a condom   could be he's trying to hide d n a   dude  someone smart enough to hide d n a   would have been smart enough not to have sex in the laundry room  no  you're missing the point   the laundry room afforded opportunity   it wasn't an accident she was killed there   esposito  where are we on her cell phone  i pulled her records   had her service provider ping it   triangulation puts it at or near the building   yeah  well  maybe he took it so she couldn't call for help   then dumped it somewherelose by  what about her ex boyfriend  we have a first name  brent   but if we had her cell phone  he might be in the address book  what about these calls   what calls  last two months  there's dozens of incoming calls  from the same number  right  we're still running that down   but the number's a prepay   besides  those calls stopped coming  a couple weeks before she was killed  yeah   but the outgoing calls to that number stop even before that   whoever it was  she didn't want to talk to them  she was letting it go to voice mail   find this brent  bring him in for questioning   you're here by invitation only   got it   got it  good   brent johnson   yeah   i'm detective kate beckett  this is    m castle   i suppose you know why you're here  um  the cops that picked me up at my job  said you had some questions about what happened to sara   i understand that the two of you were dating  yeah  till about a month ago   a month ago  what happened then   nothing  we broke up  whose idea was that   it was a mutual thing  i guess   a mutual thing   hey  sara t's me  well  just call me back  okay   you can't just not call me back  sara  don't be a bitch    come on  sara  i just want to talk to you   look  i don't know why you can't just tell me  who this other guy is   you know    you know what  you're just a little slut   there's plenty more of those  yep  they make alec baldwin's messages  sound like rainbows and unicorns  how did you get those   from your service provider  a little advice    when you buy a prepaid phone  don't e your credit card   makes it totally traceable  i wasn't trying to hide anything   no  then why did you just lie to me   'cause no man likes getting dumped   am i right  our egos can't handle it   this one time i had an ex girlfriend cheat on me   i drank every meal for a week  i didn't even like her   if i had loved her  wow  i don't know     what i would have done   no  no  no way  it wasn't like that   oh  no  so then how did you find out about sara  if you two broke up a month ago  from a friend  chloe  chloe richardson   all right  we all went to college together   chloe's the one who got sara her job  and how did this friend find out   chloe nannies for another family in the building   the two of 'em are pretty close  so then where were you the day that sara got killed   i was where those other cops found me  at my job   look  we have video cameras there  and a sign in sheet   look  i didn't have anything to do with this   am i und arrest or something   no  you can go   but just don't leave town until we speak again   do you understand   yeah  yes  ma'am    don't leave town    don't you need probable cause for something like that   only he doesn't know that  does he   you can lie like that  that is so cool  castle   doorman told esposito that this is the playground  that all the nannies for the building go to   so hopefully we find chloe here  that brings me back a bit   a bit  i'm thinking it's a little more than that  castle  i wasn't talking about when i was a kid   i'm talking about when i used to take my daughter to the park  you used to take your daughter to the park   spring  summer  fall  we were here every day   alexis' mom was doing community theater   she was on the road a lot  so i had custody  what   nothing  i just never figured you for mr  mom   some of the best days of my life   that's actually kind of nice  yeah  tell me about it   do you know how many lonely single mothers there are  on a manhattan playground  and there i was   between marriages  exactly how many times have you been rried  castle   twice  that's it   isn't that enough  how about you  me  no  never been   really  yeah   you'd be good at it   you're both controlling and disapproving   you should really try it  i'm not an  if at first  you don't succeed   kind of a girl  castle   when it comes to marriage   i'm more of a  one and done  type   any serious candidates   becca  the doorman said she'd have a red vest on   that might be our girl   go  go  go   chloe   i'm detective beckett  was wondering if i could ask you  some questions about sara manning   um  right  right now   yeah  it won't take long   yeah  uh  maggie  can you watch becca for a sec   sara's boyfriend told us that you helped her get her job   uh  you talked to brent   yeah  when  when we got out of school   sara couldn't find work   she was temping all over town   i nanny for a family in the same building  and heard that the petersons were looking for someone   when was the last time you saw sara   i know what it feels like to lose somebody  chloe   but we need to ask you these questions   yeah   um  sometimes we'd meet up before work   get a coffee on columbus  and then walk over to work together   did you get coffee that day  yeah   did she say anything to you   did she seem upset   upset  upset about what   brent gave us the impression  that sara was seeing someone else   you know who it was  don't you   sometimes sara would stay late   stay late where  at the petersons'   ah  we got off work around the same time   so we'd take the train home together   i live with a roommate a couple blocks from sara   only the last few months  she'd been staying late   mr  and mrs  peterson kind of take turns  coming home for dinner  you know   yeah  mrs  peterson told us   god  i i don't want to say something  and then     i mean  i mean  he's married   wait a minute  sara td you about him   no  no  not exactly  it's just     the nights mrs  peterson didn't come home for dinner     those were the only nights sara stayed late   i told you we should have asked the husband  more questions that day  and i told you that i like to question  my most likely suspects after i know more about them   that way they're tied to more specific answers  you suspected him  too   the husband  duh  you would really clean up at my poker game   right  you  james patterson  and the rest of the  times  best seller list   thank you  castle  little too rich for my blood  we could always make it strip poker   sorry  but i prefer mystery to horror  no  yeah  i'm   i'm in the space right now   but like i told you guys   i'm gonna need at least 20 000 square feet   i    listen  i'm gonna give you guys a call back   i'll let you know if the client is interested  okay   thank you  hi  remember us   when was the last time you saw sara  mr  peterson   the night before she was killed  i told you that  which was your night to be home for dinner  right   right  w why are you asking   well  mr  peterson   unh unh unh   we have information that suggests  that sara manning was having a relationship   right  she had a boyfriend   someone else  someone else  who   me  you think i was having an affair with sara   bingo  that is  that's crazy   is it  we know that she stayed late some nights   right  she helped us make dinner    us   well  what we heard was that she helped  on the nights that your wife wasn't home   first of all  it's not what you think  when is it ever   yes  i was having an affair  so what happened   what do you mean  what happened  i cheated  i strayed   whatever you want to call it  i mean in the laundry room   what   you just said that you   yes  i was having an affair   but it wasn't with sara  for god sakes   it was with another woman in my office   look  every night that i was  supposed to be home having dinner  i wasn't   you can check the landlines from the apartment   i called to make sure that sara was okay every night   you can  you can check cell phone records  right   don't leave town   hey  what happened with the husband   oh  he was cheating  just not with our victim   here  i need you to run it down  this iher name  i'm telling you   true commitment's a thing of the past   i mean  name one happily married couple   degeneres and de rossi  ooh  i think he's got you there  bro   what is this   the view   where are we on the boyfriend   his story checks out   video and a sign in sheet  great  so now all we have is a cheating husband  with a possible alibi and no cell phone  to run the perp's fingerprints  i got something better   please tell me it's that the mayor wants him outta here  have you ever noticed how she gets a little grumpy  when she doesn't have a suspect  well  we got one now   guess who wasn't where they say they were  the day sara manning was killed  who   come on  you gotta guess   ryan  ryan  i'm not guessing   you're a killjoy  you know that  exactly what i've been telling her   no way   pretty good  huh  told you you should've guessed   you weren't at the office  the day sara manning was killed  were you   you ed  mrs  peterson   detective ryan checked with your son's school   the day they called about sara not showing up   your assistant said that you were unreachable  what are you talking about   i'm talking about sara manning  mrs  peterson   we're talking about why you lied  about where you were the day she was killed   and we know you weren't in your office  it would have been easy to sneak into the building   doorman could have been outside hailing a cab   taking a delivery   my husband is having an affair   did you know that   actually  we did   all these months  i had no idea   but then you found out  yeah  sara told me a few weeks ago   sara told you about the affair   yes  and she'd been an absolute wreck about keeping it from me  yeah  i bet she was   did you know he was paying her extra   no  he didn't mention that  imagine putting sara  in the middle of something like that  something like what   well  using sara to cover for himself   i mean  it's disgusting  i don't understand  mrs  peterson   if you had nothing to do with sara's death   then why would you lie  because my cheating husband has no idea  i'm about to serve him with divorce papers   i lied because i was at my lawyer's that afternoon   howard's not the only one who can keep a secret     don't be  you      hello there   what are you up to   nothing   you're not webcamming again  i hope   i burned a dvd from security cameras     that the police are looking at  and i've never webcammed   that's your story  and you're sticking to it  huh   the police just let you burn a dvd   you do reali  you're gonna have to stop stealing evidence  right   i thought the whole purpose of following this detective around  was to help you to write  it's called research  mother   well  you'd better hope  this last derrick storm book sells  lover boy   because research don't pay the    bills   is that the nanny   what married woman in her right mind  invites a girl that pretty into her own home   hey  hey   what are you guys watching  i'm watching  she's butting in   the police can't find the nanny's cell phone   they were hoping to lift some fingerprints from it   i just thoug i could see it she had it with her  when she went down to the laundry room  and   it's in her hand the first time she brings the clothes  down to the wash  but then she doesn't have it  when she goes down to use the dryer  so    she probably left it  upstairs in the apartment where she worked   they say they can't fi   find it  wait a sec   what   there's a 5 second time difference   a 5 second time difference in what   she rides the elevator twice to the basement   the first time to put the clothes in the washer   the second time to put them in the dryer    only the second time  the trip takes her five seconds longer   why would it take her longer to travel the same distance  it wouldn't   i'm not quite sure where you're going with this  castle  up   all right  32 seconds   it takes 32 seconds to get from the basement to the 12th floor   great  i'll alert the media   only the second time  it took her 37 seconds   why would it take her five extra seconds  because the second time   she wasn't coming from the 12th floor   she was coming from the      the petersons live on 12  yeah  but i bet the guy who wears that condom lives on 15   by the way  that whole elevator thing   i just did that 'cause you smell nice   castle  you can't just knock on people's doors  why not   who is it  because you're gonna freak them out   police   you're the police  uh  she is   i'm sorry  do you live here alone  yeah  why you wanna ow   uh  don't worry about it  you're not young enough  young enough for what   to have sex  uh  what kind of cops did you say you were   he's not a cop  i'm a cop   and you're looking for someone to have sex with   castle  look   so sorry to bother you    pardon me  is this little girl becca   i'm sorry  i'm not sure i'm following   prior to her murder   we believe that sara manning was coming from this floor   well  i don't know anything about that  i was at work   maybe she came up to see chloe  chloe richardson   she and sara were friends   and our kids get togetr sometimes for playdates   hey  babe  what's going on  i thought you were going out   it's the police  police   they think chloe's friend sara might've been up here  the day she was killed   wait  you were home that day  right     what  what   what day was that   tuesday   yeah  yeah  yeah  i was  i was  i was here   so did you see sara   i don't think so  no  you don't think so   no   mind if i use your bathroom  people never think about that   when do cops use the bathroom   it's right there  thank you   so    tuesday   oh  yeah  yeah  let me think a minute  um     so you're saying that you can't say one way or the other   after chloe got here to take care of becca   i went inside to take a nap   i work most nights   condoms   and what is it that you do  mr  harris   oh  i'm a musician   condoms in the bathroom   so anyway  it's  it's possible that sara was up here   i just    couldn't really say for sure   you know  maybe you should talk to chloe about this  i already have   and what did she tell you  she said that she saw sara earlier in the day   but she didn't say athing  about sara being in your apartment   what else would she be doing up here   what is that   that sounds like somebody's cell phone   ian    who the hell's phone is this   why was her phone in your bedroom   maybe she dropped it  i don't  i don't  i don't know   you told me you went into the bedroom to take a nap   how could she go into the room  drop the phone   and you not see her  she's right  it doesn't make sense  when you think about it  we're running a test on the condoms we found  in your medicine cabinet   now there's something you never wanna hear   if the spermicide's a match  you're facing a murder charge  well  i i didn't kill sara   but you were sleeping with her   look  we had sex  okay   but when sara left my place  she was fine   you followed her down to the basement  didn't you   you followed her in the basement   and then you killed her  no  i wouldn't hurt sara   you wouldn't hurt her  you're a married man sleeping with her  in your own bed  what time did she leave your apartment   a little before 1 00  how can you be sure   because chloe gets back from the park with becca  every day around 1 00 to give her her lunch   and sara left maybe ten minutes before chloe got back   look  you ask chloe  she will tell you i was there   there's no way that i could've killed sara   detective beckett  frank garrison   i've been retained to represent mr  harris   and i'm directing him  not to answer any more of your questions  your client can answer my questions here  or he can answer them in front of a grand jury   if you've got enough to charge him  do it   otherwise  he's coming with me  let's go  mr  harris   guess it's a lot tougher  when they actually know the rules  huh   thank you   lab says condoms are a match   so we can prove they had sex  look  if chloe got home at 1 00   then there's no way he had time to get down to the basement   kill sara and make it back upstairs  maybe we ought to pick chloe up   see if she backs his story  we don't have to   why not   because the elevator cam had a time stamp   our suspect says that sara left his apartment about 12 45   and the camera in the elevator puts her on it  headed towards the basement at 12 48  we think she was murdered maybe ten minutes later   so what are we looking for  the nanny who worked for the guy   we're just trying to check out his story  he claims she got home at 1 00   and that he never left the apartment again   ah  there she is  12 54   okay  that's six minutes  after sara manning got on the elevator   well  i guess harris was telling the truth   wait   what  wait  where's the kid   where's what kid  becca   the little girl that chloe takes care of   maybe she left the kid in playground  with one of the other nannies  harris said that she came back with his daughter  at the same time every day  what difference does it make   the diffence is that there are no coincidences   not when murder's involved  chloe would've known sara's schedule  and chloe  would've known that sara was in the basement at that time  pick her up   can i help you  does chloe richardson live here   yes  but she's not

chloe works for   not exactly the whole family   she cut the mom out of the picture   where in the city did chloe go  to their apartment   she said that they needed her to babysit tonight   she must've found out that i took harris in for questioning   if she talked to his wife  she'd know he'd been released   and we both know what she does to people she doesn't like  she's going after ian harris   we better find her before she fin him   no answer in the apartment when the doorman called upstairs    but he's sure chloe's there   he says ian harris is up there  too   came home about an
