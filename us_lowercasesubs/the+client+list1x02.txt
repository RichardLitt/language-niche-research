this   she's got enough on her plate these days  to have to worry about my love life  too   yeah   hey girl  is this your coupon book   i found it on the counter   oh  it was a tip from yesterday   is

library   okay  y'all  what do you think   right  kind of sexy  might get us bigger tips   someone's an overachiever   you see  i'm trying to distract myself from the whole kyle drama   keeping busy's a good thing   hey  nick     what do you think   i like the old one   and she likes you   what does he know  he's a guy  you kidding   bobby freaks out if my shoes don't match my outfit   you sure he's batting for our team   oh  trust me    i'm sure   no man tells me what to wear   i know this cute  little package  is all that and a bag of chips   besides  what do i care  if bobby wants to pick out my clothes   it makes him happy   isn't that what love's all about   oh  here she goes again  no  seriously  guys   there's this website called second chances   you could post a message on it to kyle  maybe he'll see it   kendra  can you do me a favor   fedex truck just pulled up  can you go sign for me   oh   the girl means well   what's all this   new uniforms maybe   could be   meanwhile  the camel is back   and from the look on his face     he's thirsty   i have a surprise for you   part one is in my bag over there   and part two i'll be out with in just a minute   and i think i remember you telling me  that you love the smell of the beach   so i found this great massage oil     tropical turmoil   what do you think   oh   not exactly what i had in mind   travis   who's travis   he's my son  i'm so sorry   he must have just swapped them   when i'm not here  i'm actually a   mom   so  what does dad have to say about all this   dad's not in the picture anymore   i guess we're in the same boat   so there was a girl   hmm  annie   we met at an astros game   she was sitting two rows behind me   she caught a pop up that bounced off the dugout   and i fell in love right then and there   now  that's cute   a couple years later  when i finally  got up the courage to pop the question     my cousin  knows the jumbotron guy  at the park   i get down on one knee        right as the camera gets to us   and what do you think she said   no   exactly   it was in every paper   it made the news for a week straight   you know what  i think i heard about that   never did find out why she turned me down   well  why not   well  she disappeared   i guess all that attention finally got to her   made my decision to take a job out on a oil rig  a whole lot easier   hey  what are y'all doing   lacey just told me about maxine   you couldn't tell your own mother  about your husband's mistress   i didn't exactly tell her   more like she dragged it out of me   lacey  can't you keep your mouth shut about anything   hey  i can keep a secret   yeah  in circulation   look  mama  we don't know anything about this woman for sure   and i didn't want to get you all fired up   oh  i'm fired up  all right   nothing good can come from this   if you ask me  it's a clear sign from the lord  to move on past this mess   who knows how many secrets kyle had   okay  this is not making things easier   in fact  it's kind of making me angry   well  it's about time   honey  i've dealt with more than my fair share  of deceitful men  and i'm not gonna stand by  and watch you go through the same pain   kyle's gone  he chose to leave   who cares what he did now   i want you to move on  and find someone who doesn't lie and cheat     mommy  i really don't want to talk about this     he treats you wrong   i mean  are you even listening to anything that i am saying to you       maybe even sends you flowers now and then   you mean like the flowers you got today   who sent you flowers   nobody   i was just speaking hypothetically   i'm telling you     you got to forget this maxine woman   trust me on this one   all right  mama   good  i've got to get to the dry cleaners before they close   i'll see you later   i am so sorry  i didn't mean to say anything   you know she has this freakish power over me   so she's chasing after some guy again   who knows  probably   wow  sometimes it is shocking how different we are   she's already trolling for husband number six   and i haven't even gotten over the fact  that my first marriage is ending   please  your one marriage lasted longer  than all five of hers put together   i want the truth about kyle   and i thought maxine was my final thread   now i don't even have that   maybe you do   what's that   it's maxine's home address   i did a reverse look up on her phone number   you are officially forgiven   are we out of our minds   wouldn't be the first time   hey  we can leave if you want to   no   your husband leaves you for another woman   you want to know what she looks like   i just can't believe we're doing this   my heart is beating so fast   that must be her   that looks like kyle's old car   yeah  the one that he said he sold to that couple in galveston   oh  my god   that kid is the spitting image of        kyle   what's the emergency   why did you tell me that kyle sold his car  to a couple who lives in galveston   what are you    what are you talking about   i remember it  just like it was yesterday   you were sitting right over there   and you said that kyle was so excited  because he had sold his car  to a couple who lives in galveston   yeah  well  that's what he told me   i didn't go down there to sell it with him   what's this all about  please tell me  that you didn't know he has another family   pretty  little blonde   lives over on briarcliff behind the happy donut   has a son that looks exactly like kyle   she's driving his car   okay  riley  you're starting to freak me out here   now  just slow down a second   i have no idea what you're talking about   come on  be straight with me  evan   is he shacked up over there right now   riley  do you honestly think  that that's something i would keep from you    after everything that's happened  i honestly don't know what to think anymore   riley  look  it's me  okay   where is all this coming from   i found a note in kyle's u t  jacket   it said  max    max turned out to be maxine  lacey and i tracked her down   well  what'd she say  i didn't get a chance to talk to her  because she was standing there with her little boy   who looks just like kyle   it all got too much  so i just left   look  kyle was a royal jerk for what he did   one thing i know for sure is he would never cheat on you   and he sure as hell wouldn't have some secret family   how can you be so sure  because he's my brother  damn it   a few months ago  you wouldn't have thought  he'd walk out on us  either   why don't you just admit it  evan   you don't know kyle any better than i do   you know  i got to go   deep breath   one more deep breath before i take it off   the stones or that sexy outfit you're wearing   the stones  silly   do you really have to go back out on that rig   i mean  why would you want to work and live somewhere  where there aren't any women you're interested in   well  'cause women are complicated   ohh  and men aren't   not even in the same league   look        i know that you were really hurt by what annie did   maybe if you got some closure  you could move on   i told you  she disappeared   i don't have any way of getting in touch with her   maybe you do   one of the girls that works here     she told me about this website  second chances   i got to thinking        and i did some research     and i found annie   she's living in new mexico   i appreciate your concern   but that's all in the past   and that's kind of where i want it to stay   oh  hey  honey   so  i've been thinking     i want to go with those cute new uniforms you brought in   that's great  georgia   well  don't have a heart attack about it   my mind's just on other things   i just can't seem to get away from bad news   i think that kyle might have been having an affair   oh  honey  i'm so sorry   are you sure   no  and i don't even know if i want to know   but my mama just said i should forget about it and move on   well  i don't want to disagree with your mama   but you remember when i told you  that my ex was cheating on me   well  what i didn't tell you was i knew right here in my gut  months before he left   but i wasn't listening to my own instincts   i kept believing his mountain of lies   well  you want to know a surefire way  to nip 'em in the bud   face the truth   wait a minute  you want me to go and talk to this woman   oh  hell  yes   facing the truth about jimmy  was the first right thing i did for myself   and it felt good   honey  you have got to deal with this thing head on  and find out the truth about your husband   that's the only way you're gonna move through this   with strength and dignity   knowledge is power  honey   don't you ever forget that   who are you   kyle parks' wife   i want to know where my husband is   why  something happen to him   he left me a month ago   i didn't know   i find that very hard to believe   are you in love with him   and is he in love with you   it wasn't like that   at least not for him   he always said he was in love with you   so your son isn't kyle's   no   tommy's daddy died of an overdose   that's how i met kyle  in n a   i'm a recovering addict  too   k kyle's not an addict   uh  look  this really isn't something  i should be discussing with you   it's between you and kyle   well  i don't have that option right now   and i need to know what happened to him   i shouldn't be telling you this   wait  you didn't know   he thought you suspected   he had so much shame when he couldn't find a job   he said you needed him to be strong   that everyone did   but he could talk to you   i let him be whoever he was   h he did the same for me   i'm so sorry for bothering you like this   don't be   i always wondered what you were like   i'm clean because your husband listened to me   so do me a favor   when he comes back     do the same for him   if he comes back   well  it's about time   i told you everything on the phone   you didn't have to come over here so late   of course i did  my baby's hurting   i've got to be here with you   well  that's sweet  but     besides  i need to look you in the eye  and make sure you hear me   you have to close the door on kyle for good   it's a little more complicated than that   no  it isn't  if you set your mind to it   you've got to move on   you don't want to be alone for the rest of your life  do you   mama  please  i can take care of myself   sugar  if god meant for women to be single   he would have taught us all how to use a hammer   okay  i really don't want to talk  about the men in my life anymore   but we can talk about the ones in yours   i don't know what you mean   well  i know that you've been seeing someone behind my back   getting flower deliveries   what if i have   why didn't you say anything to me   while you're going through all this ruckus with kyle   it would be heartless   you sure it's not because i've made too much fun of you   all the trips you've made down the aisle   that could be part of it   mama  i'm sorry   okay   now  i want all the juicy details   his name is garrett   man has the sweetest love for the lord     something i find

word   r riley  that doesn't even make any sense   and why didn't he say anything to us   maybe we made it too hard for him   all he had to do was ask   instead  he left his wife and kids to fend for
