 on your right  on your right   back  back  back   yeah  dan     back  back  back  back  watch the winger       you ok  dan  dan  talk to me  dan  dan  get a doctor   original airdate on fox   november 23  2004  hey   close the door  close the door   is cuddy down the hall counting to 50   she's knows i'm in here  the clinic  as she commanded    she just doesn't know i'm alone   well  you've got a full waiting room  how long do you think you can ignore them   i'm off at 4 00   you're doing this to avoid 5 minutes of work   i go out there  i get assigned a kid with a runny nose   that's 30 seconds looking at the nose   who won't leave until she sure it's not meningitis or a tumor   yes  concerned parents can be so annoying    just tell cuddy you've got an urgent case  you had to leave early   that would be lying   and that would be wrong  but luckily  the definition of urgent is fungible   not the definition of case though   you have no cases   you have no cases   you've got hand picked doctors  specialists  working for you  and they're sitting on their hands   cameron is answering my mail   time well spent i'm sure  foreman and chase   research    cretinism   so  4 03 pm  dr  house checks out  please write that down   dan's dr  house   sorry  done for the day  there's plenty of docs here to take care of you   but we had an appointment   hah  nice try  but this is a walk in clinic  which means there are no appointments   it means you walk in  sign the chart and a doctor will see you  just not me   but your letter says that we would see you   not a big letter writer   here   when did my signature get so girly   i can explain   see that  g   see how it makes a big loop on top   it doesn't even look like my handwriting   think i have something   what's the differential diagnosis for writing  g 's like a junior high school girl   it's impossible to get to you through normal channels  they have called     perseverance does not equal worthiness  next time you want to get my attention wear something fun   low rider jeans are hot   and night terrors  with no apparent cause   the kid's been to 2 neurologists  night terrors  yeah  as in big scary monsters   yes   where are you going   to see the family   you're going to examine a patient    but night terrors in a 16 year old is a very good reason to talk to this family   good work   margins look fine   no lesions   color is good   how long have you been having night terrors   three weeks   he's afraid to go to bed  he's exhausted  he can barely function   what does that tell you   nothing  it's just fun watching him blink   name as many animals that begin with the letter  b  go   baby elephant   baby elephant is actually a good answer   b  is a bear of a letter   what does that tell you   proves two things  no neurological damage  and your son is never going to be chief fry cook   in teens there are two likely causes of night terrors   post traumatic stress  any recent shootouts at your high school   no   well  then  dave  dan  if there's no trauma the other cause is sexual abuse   so  who's molesting you   teacher  extra friendly neighbor   i'd ask if either one of you were involved  but you'd deny it   we would never do anything to hurt dan   i say it here  it comes out there   this lack of response is consistent with abuse   there's no one  ok  i swear   there was trauma  i got hit in the head during a lacrosse game   did you know that he got hit in the head   they didn't mention it  no   yeah  why bother   no  no  we took him to the er after the game   he was scanned  they tested him  they said he was fine   no concussion  it's gotta be something else   you hound me for my opinion and then question my diagnosis   cool  er obviously screwed up  kid's got a concussion   i had double vision before i got hit   well  that changes everything  you need glasses   that's why you had double vision  which is why you got hit   which is why you have a concussion  which is why you have night terrors   you need to see an ophthalmologist  which i am not   you enjoyed that   i brought a reasonable case to your attention   and you shoved it in my face just to humiliate me   you're an only child  aren't you   why would you say that   everything is about you   this may seem incredibly controversial  but i think sexual abuse is bad   i just wanted to make sure he wasn't being diddled by daddy   or mommy  anything else is just a bonus   i'm not an only child   interesting   what   don't move   did i bore you in there     what  ah  no  not  not really    are you tired   sometimes   he never sleeps  of course he's tired     right now  at this moment  are you tired    no  no   that twitch in your leg  did you feel that   didn't hurt   his leg twitched  i don't see what  it's called a myoclonic jerk   it's very common when you're falling asleep   respiration rate falls  and the brain interprets this as the body dying  so it sends a pulse to wake it up   so   so  he's not asleep  he's awake   admit him   i recognize that loopy  g    so  what does the jerk tell us   nothing good  the brain's losing control of the body   can't order the eyes to focus  regulate sleep patterns or control muscles   a movement disorder  or degenerative brain disease   either way this kid's gonna be picking up his diploma in diapers and a wheelchair   maybe not that bad  could be an infection   you wish  no fever  no white count   anyone think this differential diagnosis might be compromised because we don't have an accurate family history   i took an accurate family history   you didn't even take an accurate family   his father's not his father   why would you say that   they're raising someone else's kid   from what i've read false paternity is more like 10    that's what our mom's would like us to believe   who cares  if he got it from his parents they'd both be dead by now  can we get on with the differential diagnosis    50 bucks says i'm right   i'll take your money   hit a nerve  don't worry  foreman  i'm sure the guy who tucked you in at night was your daddy   make it  100   what about leucoencephalopathy  in a 16 year old   it doesn't necessarily have to be that bad   if we exclude the night terrors it could be something systemic  his liver  kidneys  something outside the brain   yes  feel free to exclude any symptom if it makes your job easier   the night terrors were anecdotal  he could have had a bad dream   no  parents said he was conscious during the event and didn't remember anything afterwards   that's a night terror   parents said   that's a good point   before we condemn this kid  maybe we should entertain dr  chase's skepticism   i want a detailed polysomnograph   if he's having night terrors i want to see them   i usually don't move during night terrors   i'm not restraining you for them   eeg revealed abnormalities in your brain caused by nerve damage in your toes   what are you doing   fixing it   can i talk to my parents   oh  they know all about this   i'd really like to see them   please  i'd really like them here   this is gonna hurt  dan   oh  god   that's a night terror   we did a ct  mri  cbc  chem 7 and chest x ray   all the tests came back normal  there's nothing to explain his symptoms   ok  but let's pretend there's something and go from there   who sees something on this mri   no lesions  no white matter   no structural abnormalities   no space occupying tumors   he's 16  so he should have an absolutely pristine brain   the smallest thing is abnormal   meningeal enhancement  my bet is viral meningitis   excellent  you see what he did there   he took a small clue that there's a neurological problem and wasn't afraid to run with it   there's no evidence of meningitis on that mri   no  there's not  he completely wrong   then what clue are you talking about   he knew that i saw something on the mri so he figured there must be something there and took a guess   clever  but also pathetic   so  what did you find   take a close look at the corpus collosum   it looks ok   are we all looking at the same thing   the george washington bridge between the left and right side of the brain    it's subtle   there's some bowing  there  an upward arch   are you guessing   yes   too bad  you're right   he probably just moved  nobody stays perfectly still for their entire mri   yeah  he probably got restless and shifted one hemisphere of his brain to a more comfortable position   something is pushing on it   if there's bowing it could be a tumor   do you see a tumor on this mri   no  but i don't see any bowing  either   there's no tumor  just a blockage causing pressure  causing symptoms   today night terrors  tomorrow he's bleeding out of his eyes   get him a radionucleotide cisternogram  i guarantee you'll see a blockage   ok    all right easy     now  i'm injecting a material that's tagged with a radioactive isotope   it's gonna enter your spine and travel up to your brain   it'll make you able to think deep thoughts   at about 100 miles per hour   easy   their eyes aren't the same color  but that fleck in the eyes     that's maybe a one in ten chance if they're not related   nah  house isn't gonna pay you based on that    any excuse we can give the folks to justify a dna test   we could tell them he's got huntington's   the whole family should be tested or they'll all die   hey  there's a lot of blockage   i've scheduled him for surgery   they're gonna put a shunt into one of the ventricles to give the cerebrospinal fluid an out   no more pressure  everything goes back to normal   he's lucky to have you as his doctors   no formula  just mommy's healthy natural breast milk   yummy   her whole face just got swollen like this overnight   mmhmm  no fever  glands normal  missing her vaccination dates   we're not vaccinating   think they don't work   i think some multinational pharmaceutical company wants me to think they work   pad their bottom line   mmmm  may i   sure   gribbit  gribbit  gribbit   all natural no dies  that's a good business  all natural children's toys   those toy companies  they don't arbitrarily mark up their frogs   they don't lie about how much they spend in research and development   the worst a toy company can be accused of is making a really boring frog   gribbit  gribbit  gribbit   you know another really good business   teeny tiny baby coffins   you can get them in frog green or fire engine red   really  the antibodies in yummy mummy only protect the kid for 6 months   which is why these companies think they can gouge you   they think that you'll spend whatever they ask to keep your kid alive   want to change things  prove them wrong   a few hundred parents like you decide they'd rather let their kid die then cough up 40 bucks for a vaccination   believe me  prices will drop really fast   gribbit  gribbit  gribbit  gribbit  gribbit   tell me what she has   a cold   there's a problem   complications in surgery   surgery went fine  he's in recovery  but we took a vial of csf and tested it   really   turns out the bowing wasn't the cause of his problems  it was a symptom   oligoclonal bands  and an increase of intrathecal igg   which means multiple sclerosis   and the reason it takes three of you to tell me this   because we're having a disagreement about whether or not it is ms   no lesions on the mri   it's early  he's had the disease for maybe two weeks   mcdonald criteria requires six months to make a definitive diagnosis   oh  who cares about mcpherson  i hear he tortured kittens   mcdonald   oh  mcdonald  wonderful doctor  loved kittens   the vep indicates slowing of the brain   without the lesions we can't be sure   well if it is  it's gone from 0 to 60 in three weeks  which would indicate rapidly progressive ms   not the fun ms with the balloons and the bike rides for cripples in wheelchairs   we should wait until we  start treating him now  he can walk for another couple of years  maybe live for another 5   break it to the family  i'm going home   it'll take months for a definitive diagnosis   what'll happen to me   ms is an incredibly variable disease   if it is ms  and we're not 100  sure   what do you think is gonna happen   there are some medications to manage the symptoms   but as the disease progresses the problems will become more severe   bowel and bladder dysfunction  loss of cognitive function  pain   it's gonna hurt   the brain's like a big jumble of wires   ms strips them of the insulation  and the nerves die   the brain interprets it as pain    but by starting treatment we're gonna avoid that for as long as possible   we're looking into a couple specialists   and until we get you squared away you'll stay here    ok   security checked the videotapes for all the perimeter cameras   he's still gotta be in the hospital   where's chase   main floor   ok  you take the cafeteria and administration   i'll hit the research annex and work my way back to you   dan   i'm not here  leave a message   dr  cuddy  great outfit   what are you doing back here  patient   no  hooker  went to my office instead of my home   dr  house  dan's missing   yeah  i got that part from the message  you said i was needed immediately   he shouldn't move after a lumbar puncture   i agree  he's gonna have a very nasty headache   that would also be my opinion if consulted tomorrow morning   we wanted to keep you informed   he heard some pretty heavy news   this is not a toddler wandering around a department store   he's 16  you'll find him  i'm going home   so  when you say  call me if you need anything   you mean   don't call me    no  i mean  call me if i can do something    i'm bad at search parties and i'm bad at sitting around looking nervous doing nothing   what about his parents  should we call them   why  you think they're hiding him   make sure someone checks the roof   some of the orderlies keep the door propped open so they can grab a smoke   dan  you ok   there are experimental treatments  ongoing research     who knows what they'll discover in a year or two   this is where i dropped the ball   dan  we're standing on the roof of the hospital   dan  dan  you're not on the field   he doesn't know where he is   dan   foreman   dan   dan   dan  no   dr  foreman   i assume you found the kid   he almost walked off the roof   suicidal   no  he thought he was on his lacrosse field   look  look  i was just gonna run home  shower  change     conscious   yeah   how'd you talk him down   actually  chase tackled him   how come you didn't do it   right  well  i am black  but he was closer   come on  you can ride up with me   anybody tell the family that their boy almost stepped off a roof  they must be thrilled   they're not suing  but i think only because chase asked them   why does everyone always think i'm being sarcastic   this is great news  he doesn't have ms   the parents should be thrilled  well  the mom anyway   of course  the dad probably doesn't know  why doesn't he have ms   he was on the roof thinking he was on the lacrosse field   conscious  and therefore not a night terror  you want some of this   yeah  sure   he was in an acute confusional state   which doesn't fit with a demyelinating disease like ms   the oligoclonal bands   were real  they just mean something other then ms   so  what are they telling us   that the immune system is working   right  he has an infection in his brain   what about sex   well  it might get complicated   we work together   i am older  certainly  but maybe you like that   i meant maybe he has neurosyphilis   heh  nice cover   sorry  rpr was negative   we don't need a definitive test to confirm this   sure  didn't need one to confirm ms   ok  let's wait for you to run titers on 4000 viruses while this kid's brain turns to mush   so the fact that he doesn't have ms is  it's really not good news after all   well  it is if it's neurosyphilis   the likelihood of a false negative on an rpr test  30     the likelihood of a 16 year old having sex  roughly 120    i'll start him on iv penicillin   we're not going to wait for that   the most effective way to deliver the drug is right into his brain via the spine   we can't  in a cramped space like the brain   increased intracranial pressure from a high volume drug like penicillin could herniate his brain stem and kill him   no neurologist in his right mind would recommend that   show of hands  who thinks i'm not in my right mind   and who thinks i forget this fairly basic neurological fact   who thinks there's a third option   very good  what's the third choice   no idea  you just asked if i thought there was one    the patient has a shunt in his brain   there'll be no increased pressure  we can put as much penicillin into his body as we want   excellent  inject him through a lumbar puncture   one of us is going to do this to you twice a day for the next two weeks     he could get syphilis even if he's not sexually active   well  it's unusual  but it's possible   relax   geesh   it's infected   with a really big hole like you stuck a nail in it to relieve the pressure   i wouldn't do that   although the wound is irregular   not cylindrical  it's shaped like a triangle  so not a nail   steak knife   wife's nail file   nail file   yeah  pain'll make you do stupid things   something to take the edge off   yeah   cheers   so  do you have family here in princeton   no   here on work   no  why are you  does your penis hurt   no  what  should it   no  just thought i'd toss you a really inappropriate question   your lawyer's gonna love it   why would i want to sue you  i want you to treat me   you're from maplewood  new jersey  right   yeah   now  why would you drive 70 miles to get treatment for a condition that a 9 year old could diagnose   it's the free flowing puss that's the tip off   i was in town   not for family  not for work   you drove 70 miles to a walk in clinic  you passed two hospitals on the road   now  either you have a problem with those hospitals  or they have a problem with you   my guess is that you've sued half the doctors in maplewood   and the rest are now refusing to treat you   it's ironic  isn't it   it's like the boy who sued wolf   you know what  i bet we have a doctor here named wolfe   how perfect would that be   i'm gonna page him   ok  you know what  thank you  i'm gonna find a doctor to take care of this   i didn't say i wouldn't treat you   we'll drain your knee  run some lab work  fix you right up   why would you do that   i'm a people person   you actually treated him   all i know is that he sued some doctors  who am i to assume that they didn't have it coming to them   the cutest little tennis outfit  my god i thought i was going to have a heart attack   oh my  i didn't see you there  that is so embarrassing   how's your hooker doing   oh  sweet of you to ask  funny story   she was going to be a hospital administrator  but hated having to screw people like that   i heard you found her on the roof   you have very acute hearing   you notify the parents   in due course  of course   and is there a paternity bet on the father of the patient   doesn't sound like me   well  it does actually  but that doesn't mean you're guilty   you think   i saw the parents in the lobby  smart money is obviously on the father   my guy knows a guy who can get you in for  50 bucks   fine  you tell your guy if i win  you attend the faculty symposium and you wear a tie   and if i win  no clinic hours for a week   my guy will call your guy   she's very good at her job   the treatments should start helping soon   let us know if it gets easier to focus on things  remember stuff   hey dan  isn't dr  cameron's necklace a beauty   something south american  i think   yeah  guatemalan   it's a cool necklace   thank you so much   the kid's in pain     don't fight it    just let it happen   no     no  what    you'll be dead in three days   i give it a day   dan  you ok   dan   he's hearing voices   dan   push three milligrams iv  stat   come on dan   get out of my head   auditory hallucination shows further brain degeneration   penicillin's not working   so  either it's a bad batch of penicillin  or our diagnosis is wrong   square one   mignight    lfts  bun  and creatinine  are all normal  diabetes is out  no gap   there goes metabolic   mri rules out vasculitis    i  for inflammation   to young for anything degenerative    d   see ya   n  for neoplastic   mri was clean    i  for inflammation   we already did that   stupid to have two i's in one mneumonic   what's the other one   infection   oligoclonal bands still have to mean something   but no fevers  white count's elevated but within range   and we've tested for anything remotely possible   everything is negative   ct scan rules out subdural   trauma  later much   you know the problem   midnight is actually spelled with a  g  and an  h    if we could just figure out what those two letters stand for   it's a sick brain  having fun  torturing him  talking to him   scaring the hell out of him   get him an eeg  left and right eog esophageal microphones   if this thing wants to talk  let's listen   we're missing something   this is screwed up   that's why you came up with the brain talking to the virus thing   i panicked  ok   sounded cool though  they bought it   oh  crap   another reason i don't like meeting patients   if they don't know that you look like they can't yell at you   here we go   how can you just sit there   if i eat standing up  i spill   our son is dying  and you could care less   we're going through hell  you're doing nothing   i'm sorry  you need to vent  i understand   don't be condescending   you haven't checked in on him once   blood pressure's 110 70   the shunt is patent well placed in the right lateral ventricle   the ekg shows a normal qrs with deep wave inversions throughout both limb and pericardial leads   lfts are elevated but only twice the normal range   oh yeah  and he's hearing voices   go hold his hand   go on  i'll bus your tray   got any sample bags on you   i don't believe you  you're gonna run dna tests   their son is deathly ill  i know it's terrible   but the fact is if i don't keep busy with trivial things like this i'm afraid i might start to cry   you're an ass   yeah  you want to double the bet   general hospital is on channel 6   dan's brain's not showing channel 6 right now  only mush   no epileptiform activity   what are you doing   waiting for cbc and chem 7   good  run dna on these   what's this   parents' coffee cups   i can't believe you  i've had this conversation once already   if you've got something else to do  do it  otherwise  do this   dr  house   hey  mr  funsten   i was wondering when you'd be back   got some papers for me   you've caused me considerable mental distress   i certainly hope so   what  too cheep to have your lawyer serve it for you  or is it more fun this way   i'm obviously prepared to consider a settlement   you have gonorrhea   no  i don't   well  maybe you're right  but i have a lab result that says you do   it could be a false positive  normally i'd run a second test   but since you're here i'll just go with the first   you're just trying to scare me   it's reportable you know  public health issue   i'll be sure to let my wife know   oh  don't bother yourself  the state will call for you   look  if you're clean i'm sure this will all blow over  no big deal   there's an easy way to find out  get one of your doctors run a test   uh uh   these are mine now   i'll see you in court   west nile negative  not surprising  since not too many mosquitoes passing through jersey in december   no eastern equine encephalitis   you guys aren't going to believe this   what's that   house was right  the father's not the father    dude doubled up on me   you're not gonna believe this   the mother's not the mother either   it's not a good idea to move your son in his condition   we just want a second opinion   we need an answer   you idiots   you lied to me   we didn't lie about anything   you  on the other hand  accused us of molesting our son   perfect   can we get off my screw ups and focus on theirs   theirs is bigger  you're not dan's parents   we're his parents   he was adopted  he doesn't need to know   i do   adoption makes him just as much as  listen  when we were taking his medical history  were you confused    did you think we were looking for a genetic clue to his condition   or did you think we were trying to ascertain who loves him the most in the whole wide world   how did you find out about this   i sampled their dna   we didn't give you any dna   your coffee cups from the cafeteria   you can't do that   again  why are we getting hung up on what i did   your medical history is useless   no  we gave you a detailed history of his biological mother   her history   non smoker  good health  low cholesterol  no blood pressure problems   dan was adopted two weeks after he was born  you have his history   there's nothing you need to know that we didn't tell you   sounds reasonable   well  if you want to transfer your boy that is your choice   but i still think it's the wrong  was she vaccinated   the biological mother  when she was a baby  did she get her vaccinations   dan was vaccinated at 6 months   mm hmm  and do you know why kids get vaccinated at 6 months   because before that  they are protected by their biological mother's immune system   so  was she vaccinated   an infant picks up a regular old measles virus   he gets a rash  he's extremely uncomfortable  has a wicked fever  but he lives   here's the kicker  once every million or so times  the virus mutates   instead of dan having a fever and a rash  the virus travels to his brain and hides like a time bomb    in this case for 16 years   sub acute sclerosing pan encephalitis   i know  there's only been 20 cases in the united states in the past 30 years   i suppose you could make an argument that the kid's still in stage one   once sspe moves to stage two  boom  stage two is universally fatal   i assume it's impossible to tell when he might move into stage two   he's already started showing symptoms  it could be a month  it could be tonight   can we treat it   ask the neurologist   intraventricular interferon   we're not gonna shove a spike into his brain and drip interferon without confirming this diagnosis   tap him   we won't get a reliable result for measles antibodies in his csf   not after everything we've given him    why do people lie to me   it could also kill him   your ball  foreman  tell me i don't have to biopsy his brain   well  there is one other way   you sure this isn't gonna hurt   yeah  it's just scary as hell   see  we go through the pupil   you won't feel it  the eye's been paralyzed   the needle travels to the back of the eye which is where we perform the biopsy on your retina   so we've confirmed that the problem is this mutated virus   the treatment for sspe is intra ventricular interferon   we implant an ommaya reservoir under the scalp   which is connected to a ventricular catheter  that delivers the antiviral directly to the left hemisphere  look  you want us to consent to this   i don't even understand what you're talking about   well  the antiviral  look  i'm sorry   i can explain this as best i can   but the notion that you're gonna fully understand your son's treatment  and make an informed decision  is  it's kinda insane   now  here's what you need to know   it's dangerous  it could kill him   you should do it   you can't order a  3 200 dna test to win a bet   it's not an actual cost   i don't know if you know this  but the hospital actually owns the sequencing machine   i'm serious   well  tell the parents to submit the bill to insurance   insurance is not going to pay for a bet   it should  if we don't make that bet  the kid dies    if not for the paternity bet  i never would have taken their dna   without their dna we never would have discovered that dan was adopted   which was the key to this case   you just don't want to pay your end   big mistake  my guy knows a guy   fine  i will let you out of clinic duty for one week   after you pay the  3 200 for the pcr test   whoo   well now  there's the  100 you owe me   there's the  100 i won from cameron    200 i took off of foreman   and  600 i got from wilson   very bitter   hey  good morning   good news on your eeg  treatment is working   and your immune system is responding   i know it's early  but let me take a look   let's see what that brain of yours can do   name as many animals as you can that start with the letter  o    ostrich  ox  old elephant   well  that's 2 better then last time   how you doing with the whole adoption thing   i knew since 5th grade   how's that   cleft chin   i have one  my dad
