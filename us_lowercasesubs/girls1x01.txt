sync   corrections by honeybunny   will you two slow down   you're eating like they're going to take it away from you   i'm a growing girl   it's such a pleasure seeing you and     seeing how well work is going   work's going really well  yeah   my boss said that he wants to see my book  when it's done  which is really exciting   where are you at with that   oh  well  i've done four of the essays   and i'm just kind of polishing them up   and my hope is that it's going to be nine   but  you know  it's a memoir  so   have to live them first   tim  i don't want to just leave it  till the end of dinner   i hear that  um     hannah  your mother and i have been     talking  and we feel that it may be time    how can i phrase this   well  we see how well you're doing at work   and you really seem to be figuring out what it is that you want   but it may be time for one final push   what is a  final push    we're not going to be supporting you any longer   you see  i wasn't going to phrase it like that  loreen     the way you phrased it    but i have no job   no  you have an internship that you say is going to turn into a job   i don't know when   you graduated from college two years ago   we've been supporting you for two years  and that's enough   do you know how crazy the economy is right now   i mean  all my friends get help from their parents   we are sympathetic to that   but i'm your only child   it's not like i'm draining all your resources   i mean  this feels very arbitrary   you don't know anything about our finances   we're professors  hannah  professors   we can't keep bankrolling your groovy lifestyle   my  groovy  lifestyle   the bills add up  we're covering your rent   your insurance  your cell phone   you said it was cheaper for you if i was on the family plan   yeah   may i get you more of anything     uh     no  she's fine     delicious    yeah   this is nuts   ted  can you help me here   i could be a drug addict  do you realize how lucky you are   i mean  it doesn't have to be heroin   it could be something more insidious  like pills   which are legal  and which a lot of kids do  all the time   and then slowly they become totally useless   they seem really high functioning  and then it just ruins them   okay  my friend sophie  her parents don't support her   last summer  she had two abortions  right in a row  and no one came with her   what does that have to do with anything   i'm just saying that i am so close to the life that i want   the life that you want for me   for you to just end that right now   no more money     starting when    starting now   we can talk about it tomorrow   i don't want to see you tomorrow     what    but we fly out tuesday   i have work  and then i have a dinner thing   and then i am busy  trying to become who i am   alarm  alarm     where is it    i don't know   miss  you are here   already   good morning  charlie   why didn't you wake me up   i didn't mean to sleep with hannah   because you two looked so angelic   hmm  victoria's secret angel  fat baby angel     don't say that    no way  you look awesome these days   please avert your eyes   oh     is that a present   is that for me     uh oh  give it here    thank you   you guys fell asleep to mary tyler moore again  huh   yes  guilty   it's a very odd show to hear through a wall   coming at ya   here it comes   pow   i just blew up a kiss on you     are you going to leave your towel on     yes   but i never see you naked  and you always see me naked   when it should actually be the other way around     you are beautiful  shut up    i don't need that     i need to see your boobs    we  you don't get to  sorry   i only show my boobs to people i'm having sex with   you literally slept in my bed to avoid him   i know   he and i have turned a corner   his touch now feels like  a weird uncle just putting his hand on my knee at thanksgiving   what are you going to do     i think i have to end it    you can't do that   i have to  why not   'cause he'll stand outside our window with a boom box    or he'll kill himself    stop   hey  babe  oh  whoa   sorry  i thought it was just my girlfriend in here   dude  it's never just your girlfriend in here   i'm just saying goodbye   i'll see you ladies tonight  and i'll pick up wine   okay  big kisses   bye   what does it even feel like to be loved that much   i don't know  i can't feel it anymore   oh  no   i know  i just    and it makes me feel like such a bitch  'cause i can feel him being so nice to me   and yet it makes me so angry   i think you need to admit something to yourself   which is that you're sick of eating him out     ew    'cause he has a vagina     hi  ca va    bonjour  roomie   oh  my god  you're so hip  i could puke   i can never pull off that hat  how do you pull off that hat   i love your jumper   your skin is  like  hauntingly beautiful     can i put my bags down    what   oh  my god  of course   you're like my favorite cousin   i'm the only one of my girlfriends that has a british cousin   how long do you think you're going to stay for   not that i'm asking you to leave  you can totally stay forever if you want to     can i have something to eat    yeah   you've been interning there for a year   you need to tell them it's time to get paid   costs a lot of money to look this cheap   this is not a joke  if you can't afford to pay your half of the rent   charlie is going to move in here     you're dumping charlie    i didn't say that   so i texted adam about tonight  and i have not heard anything back   hannah  look at me   he never  ever texts you back   maybe i should call him   didn't you say texting's like the lowest form of communication    on the pillar of chat    the totem of chat   no  the lowest  that would be facebook   followed by gchat  then texting     then email  then phone    gotcha   face to face is  of course  ideal  but it's not of this time   okay  but then how am i supposed to get him face to face  if he refuses to text me   think jessa will really appreciate the welcome home dinner   it's a very friendish thing of us to do   what   i just know she's going to show up late   wearing some fabulous blankety dress  from a grecian marketplace and be like      oh  i can't remember where i got this    i'm really glad that she's coming home   but every time she comes into town   you go on some week long bender   and then she leaves to go off to her next country  and i'm left to pick up the pieces   okay  it is so rare that i say this   but i just think she's fun   yeah  it was really fun when she fucked carolyn   s boyfriend   she didn't fuck your boyfriend   that's 'cause he was in prague that semester   thanks so much   it's a great deal for nolita   i mean 2 100 a month  amaze   it's a little more expensive than the dorms   but aunt ilene thinks it's like the perfect bachelorette pad   i mean     do you like the poster   oh  you know  i've never seen that movie     only the show    is it a show   oh  my god  you're not serious   i mean  that's like not being on facebook     i'm not on facebook    you're so fucking classy   you know  you're funny because you're definitely like a carrie  but with  like  some samantha aspects and charlotte hair     that's like a really good combination    oh  thank you   i think i'm definitely a carrie at heart   but  like  sometimes    sometimes samantha kind of comes out   and then when i'm at school  i definitely try and put on my miranda hat   where were you before france   before france  i was in amsterdam    no  i was in bali   and i was shucking pearls there   and then i met a surfer    oh  my god  did he really like you     he really liked you  right    yeah  he really liked me     hannah    hello  alistair   hello   you seem eager   as you know  i've been working here for over a year   has it been that long   well  you are an invaluable part of our operation   which i recently learned means very valuable  as opposed to not at all valuable   and i wanted to let you know that my circumstances have changed  and i can no longer afford to work for free   oh  hannah   i am so sorry to lose you   i was just going to start you manning our twitter   you have just the quippy voice for that   oh  no  i'm not quitting   i just   i know that joy lynn got hired after interning     so i thought that maybe     hannah   joy lynn knows photoshop   now  in this economy   do you know how many internship requests i get every day     i would assume a lot    50  it's about 50   i practically route them into my spam folders   so  if you think you have just nothing left to learn from us     no  it is not that  really   i just  you know  gotta eat   well  when you get hungry enough   you're going to figure it out   do you mean like physically hungry or hungry for the job   i am really going to miss your energy   i think this is going to be really good for you   uh  you mentioned that when i was finished with my book   i could send it to you   well  we wouldn't have you here  to read it for us  would we   where are you going   will you get me a luna bar   and a smartwater and vitaminwater   yo  hey   yeah  no  i'm actually just leaving a friend's house  that's  like  right by your house  so     yeah     hey  hey  doll    hey    doll   that is what my dad calls me   yeah  i know  he told me  we're in the same circle jerk     i just had the worst ever day    you were nearby   why   um  i got fired from my job   weren't you an intern   well  i was working there for a while so i was technically an intern   so basically they just asked you to not hang out there anymore   but i was walking over here    funny  i was on my way over here and i was panicking   but then it occurred to me  i'm an english major  there has to be some    major doesn't matter  i was comp lit and it hasn't done shit   yeah  but you're an actor  so aren't you always comparing different literature   i i don't know   plus i'm into this woodworking stuff  it's just more honest   yeah  it all looks awesome  but what about your play   yeah  we're not doing it  that guy's a dick     can i sit down    yeah   so if i tell you something  will you promise that you won't judge me   yes   till yesterday  i got all of my money from my parents   okay   does that make you feel sick  make you not want to talk to me   no  i mean i wouldn't take shit from my parents  they're buffoons     but my grandma gives me  800 a month    whoa   mm hmm   so is  like  that how you support yourself   yeah  i mean  i supplement   but it gives me the freedom that i don't have to be anyone's slave   you should never be anyone's fucking slave   except mine   you're feeling pretty frisky   i really despise that word  i hate it so much   i like you so much  i don't know where you disappear to   what are you talking about  i'm right here   it's so funny that it's still light out   but it's getting dark a lot earlier these days     is this some of your poetry    don't be a jerk   who  me   do you know that part on your resume  where they ask you to list all of your special skills   i haven't applied for a job in a long fucking time   it's the thing where they ask you to list  like   yoga  spanish   waterskiing  photoshop   i feel like i     don't have any special skills     i have something you can do    what   but first i have to see if you fulfill all the requirements   what are the requirements   lie on your stomach     now    yes  now  wait   you modern career woman  i know what you like   you think you can just come in here  and talk all that noise   uh  no   grab your legs     just   what did you say    grab your legs   okay   okay  this is good     i'm gonna go get some lube    why do we need to get lube   when i get back  i want you in the exact same position   but take all the rest of the shit off   will you get a condom   i'll consider it   jesus fucking christ   this is really hard     is that okay    yeah     you putting on a condom    no     wait  you are  right    yes   okay  'cause when you said the thing about lube   i was worried you were going to try to    do that  please don't do that   that feels awful  thank you     it's all right    okay  thank you   that's the right spot   yeah  sorry   so i can just stay like this for a little while   yeah     do you need me to move more    what   i just didn't know if you wanted me to be more like   like that   oh  no  this is fine  you're doing great   this is all you need to do   i'm sorry about the wrong hole thing   i just   i don't want to do it now   and if we did  i'd just want to talk about it  and just figure out what   it's just not comfortable for me      let's play the quiet game    so you're not mad at me   no  i'm great   a great time   you know what would be crazy     what would be crazy    if we     just got crazy  right here right now   we could just do that   nobody's stopping us  nobody's home   what would turn you on the most right now   what would turn me on the most   what would turn you on the most   to turn you on  that's what would turn me on     let me do that    okay  uh     um  what if you were a stranger   oh  yeah  a stranger   what if you were just like a totally different person   you didn't act like you   i think jessa's here     oh  no  i think that might be ray    you invited ray     it was going to be like a four person party    that's called dinner   gosh  i'm sorry     what's with all the tattoos    what do you mean   why'd you do all of them   they're illustrations from children's books mostly   even the one on your ass   uh  no  that one my friend jessa did  sophomore year with a safety pin   it's a snake wrapped around the moon   when did you do that   i did them mostly in high school   why   truthfully  i gained a bunch of weight very quickly   and i just felt very out of control of my own body   and it was just this  like    i'm taking control of my own shape      you know  i was fat in high school    really   yeah  but i didn't go drawing all over myself   you're not that fat anymore  you can just have them lasered off   mm   mmm     what time is it

need to go and talk to my parents  and ask them to support me until i get a job   why don't you just tell them that you're an artist   you just need to tell them once and for all  that you are an artist   just tell them you're going to get a job   that's much more convincing   tell them you'll get tuberculosis in a garret if you have to   tell them it's what flaubert did   flaubert is not a good role model   and have you met her parents   she can't just do the artist thing   ll them that picasso did it   rappers who were poor and sold their tapes in the street did it   it's what elvis did  it's what mick jagger did   it's what my stepbrother did   they all stuck to their guns   i need to go   you just drank an entire cup of opium   you are gorgeous and a vision   you are a brilliant genius   both of you are sex goddesses   when i look at both of you   a coldplay song plays in my heart   bye   god  she seems like she's in such a good place   mom  papa     i think that's hannah    did she just call me papa     hi    oh  hey  what the heck are you doing here   i thought you didn't want to see us anymore   actually  i couldn't bear the idea  of not seeing you before you

boiling   great  we'll read it on the plane   no  now  i need you to read it now   because     i don't want to freak you out   but i think that i may be  the voice of my generation   or at lease a voice  of a generation   well  just read  don't be scared  just enjoy it  'cause there's going to be plenty for us to talk about after   just go for it   i need to talk to you   all right   i do not

person   marnie  you can't mother her like that   i'm not mothering her  i'm literally preventing a disaster from happening   have you even read her novel   it's a memoir  and of course i've read it  i'm her best friend   best friend  this is my best friend   you know  we don't own anybody   maybe you don't respect what a best friendship means  because you've never stayed in one place long enough

  and then i follow suit  i become uptight   it is the most frustrating dynamic on the planet     it drives me crazy  i can't stand it    i'm fucking pregnant   all right  i'm pregnant     on purpose    what do you think   i have to tell you something  you two   you guys are so beautiful   okay  all right   that's a high person     this is very funny stuff  loreen    yeah  uh huh     hannah  you're a very funny girl    thank you  papa     okay    oh   all i am asking for  to finish this book  is  1 100 a month  for the next two years     that's insane    that's a chunk of change   you would say it's insane  who can live in new york  on  1 100 a month   but i am so committed to this book  that i am willing to get pretty thrifty on this   why don't you get a job and start a blog   you are so spoiled   yeah  well  whose fault is that  mom     your father's    this is making me so unhappy     i'm having such a horrible feeling    we're not wamu  hannah     and the least you can do is sit up

going to drink a strong cup of coffee   i'm 24 years old  don't tell me what to do   this is a real display   no  this is the immediate result of a cold approach     you can't just pull the rug out suddenly    why are you doing this   we should stay a few more days   i admire your kind heart  i really do   but you're getting played by a major fucking player   i know  but it's hard for me to watch her struggle   my skirt feels so tight   maybe you can just cut it open with a scissors   it's like watching her get a shot   shots keep people from getting sick     i want a lake house  i work hard    i know  i know   i want to sit by a fucking lake     you deserve a lake    i'm gonna die like flaubert in a garret   don't look at me   mom   dad   hi  i'm in room 2507   and i wanted to get
