      louie  louie louie  louaaa          louie  louie  louie  louie          louie  louie you're gonna die          yeah          louie  louie  louie  louie      i'm 41 and i'm single   not really single  just alone  but i have two children  and that's the only thing  i'm comfortable with in life anymore   i know how to take care of a couple of kids   i don't like french toast   oh  sorry  that's what we're having   mommy doesn't make us french toast   uh huh   i go to my daughter's school to volunteer sometimes   my daughter goes to a public school   and i volunteer  not 'cause i'm a good person  but because you have to  because nobody works there   there's just nobody there   you go in the school  like thousands of kids   you go  where is any grown up right now   and i usually go for lunch and recess   that's when they really need grown ups   is for lunch  to volunteer in the cafeteria  because they only   they have 300 kids eating  and they have one jamaican lady watching all of them   it doesn't matter that she's jamaican  but it totally does   because there's nobody  who can be mean to 300 children  just in the way that the jamaican lady    and it's not her fault  she's outnumbered   would be like   shut up     so my job as a volunteer is to stand there   usually near my daughter so i can be with her   and then kids raise their hand  you need to go and help them   usually  they need help opening a milk   because they can't open their milks   they can't do it   because it's 2009  and we still put milk  in this little paper box   put it in a bottle   i don't know why we're doing this torture   we put it in this envelope  that was invented by some dutch  in 1773   and they can't do it  they can't open it   it's too subtle an idea   a design for a seven year old to peel back the paper  and then gather it forward into a spout shape   and they can't   the glue is vicious   so they have to pick at the corner and try to get it   and they end up drinking out of this finger filth disease spout   so they can't do it   so they raise their hand and i do it for them   i'm not better at it   i just   i deal with the stress better than they do   i don't cry like a little bitch 'cause i can't open my milk   i'm a man   hi  daddy  hey  honey   just find a seat near the front  okay   i'll be on in a minute   all right  kids   all right  everyone on the bus and

dimitrio   yeah  yeah  it's louis c k   do you realize what you're teaching them   uh huh   all right  kids  new field trip   everybody gets to go home in their own limousine   get in the car  get in the car   go  go  go  go  get in the car   i think a lot of people who think they're good people  are living a really evil life without thinking about it   and the   here's the thing   the whole premise of my life is evil   i'm white  my kids are white   which means they can't really screw up too badly   'cause they'll get  like  a million chances   my life is really evil  like i    there are people who are starving in the world   and i drive an infiniti   that's really evil   there are people who would just starve to death   that's all they ever did   there's people who are like born   and they go   oh  i'm hungry   and then they just die   and that's all they ever got to do   and meanwhile  i'm in my car   boom  boom  pow    like having a great time and i sleep like a baby   it's totally my fault   'cause i could trade my infiniti for like a really good car   like a nice ford focus with no miles on it   and i'd get back like  20 000   and i could save hundreds of people from dying of starvation  with that money  and every day i don't do it   every day i make them die with my car   it's not fun to be single at 41   i was married for ten years ie  i'm divorced  i got two children   it's hard to start again after a marriage   it's hard to really  like  look at somebody and go    hey  maybe something nice will happen    you just don't    i know too much about life  to have any optimism   because i know even if it's nice   it's going to lead to shit   i know that if you smile at somebody and they smile back   you've just decided that something shitty  is going to happen   you might have a nice couple of dates   but then she'll stop calling you back and that'll feel shitty   or you'll date for a long time  and then she'll have sex with one of your friends   or you will with one of hers  and that'll be shitty   or you'll get married   and it won't work out and you'll get divorced  and split your friends and money and that's horrible   or you'll meet the perfect person who you love infinitely   and you even argue well and you grow together  and you have children   and then you get old together and then she's gonna die   that's the best case scenario   is that you're gonna lose your best friend  and then just walk home from d'agostino's  with heavy bags every day  and wait for your turn to be nothing also   i'll be just a minute  sorry   it's okay  thanks   no problem   do you know where we're going yet   what   do you know where we're going yet   uh     i don't know  i just   i thought we'd just wing it   i had a few ideas   hello   oh  i'm

ahead and take your big dump   there you go   oh  jesus   look  i    i'm not very good at dating   really  i think you're doing great   all right  i get it   it sucks going out with me   you know  i've been married for ten years   i'm sorry if i'm not the fonz all over the place   i'm a father  all right   that's what matters to me   i have two little girls  oh   and i'm raising them  okay   that's who i am  i'm a real man   that's what i do   what are you  who are you   what's your contribution   you're cute and you got a flat stomach and you're young   it's   why am i trying to impress you   why don't you tell me about your goddamn life  and try to impress me   why aren't you nervous to be with me   it's true  everything that makes you happy  is going to end at some point   and nothing good ends well   it's like  if you buy a puppy  you're bringing it home  to your family's saying   hey  look  everyone  we're all gonna cry soon   look at what i brought home   i brought home us crying in a few years   here we go   countdown to sorrow with a puppy   i remember i had a dog when i was a kid   because he had a tumor on his snout   and i remember i was home when the vet called and said    yeah  that's a malignant tumor  he's gotta go    and i was like   well  can we fix it     and he goes   i'd have to just remove his whole snout   a then he'll just have this weird  round  furry head   that doesn't look like a dog    and he can only eat with a straw    but you can't teach a dog to suck through a straw    so he'll just die of being stupid   and having a round head    so i think you should just kill him   that's what i recommend    and i was like   okay  well  should we make an appointment  for a few weeks from now     and i swear to god  the guy goes    no  just bring him over  i'm not doing anything   i'll kill him right now    like  just bring him over now  why wait  i'm not busy   so i bring the dog to the vet's   and i remember i'm holding the dog  and he sticks him full of a crazy amount of morphine   or the right amount if you're trying to kill a dog with it   my dog dies   and then i left him there  'cause    i mean  it was arranged   i didn't  like  sneak out and leave my dog   we had no money   so i left   and i asked the vet    i made the mistake of asking t vet    what are you gonna do with my dog     and he said   he just goes in a mass grave    and i was like   what's that like     and he goes   it's just a big pile of dead dogs    so     that night  i remember it was raining   and i had this nightmare  that my dog woke up from the morphine  and found himself in a pile of dead dogs  and crawled out past the dead cat pile   and then he just walked    and it was thunder and lightning   and just like one of those miraculous dogs  that you read about in  reader's digest   and he's made his way home and he scratched on the door   and we open the door and there he is and we go    there   he's here  look  he's back     and then we realize we just gotta do it again   gotta take him back  gotta do it again   still got a tumor on his snout   and the dog's like  are you shitting me right now   can i spend the night  jesus   so that's why it's hard to start dating  y'know   that's why it's     you still got it   daddy  where are we going   i'm taking you to your mom's house   yay  yeah   daddy  my shoes don't fit anymore
