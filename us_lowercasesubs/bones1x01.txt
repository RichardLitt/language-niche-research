aviateca airlines   what gate   i'm late   excuse me  uh     you have a computer glitch at the arrivals board   hello   sir  excuse me  yoo hoo   great   hi  the flight from guatemala   tell me you tried  excuse me  first   sweetie   yes  i did  welcome home   oh  are you exhausted   was guatemala awful   was it horribly backward   and yet  i was never reduced to flashing my boobs for information   flash them for any fun reasons   i was literally neck deep in a mass grave   not romantic   you know  diving head first in a pit of cadavers  is no way to handle a messy break up   angela  nothing pete and i ever did was messy   then you were not doing the right thing   sir  why are you following us   attack  security  hello   who runs this airport   kick his ass     step back now    he attacked me   i'm homeland security   oh    little misunderstanding here   you can put away your guns   what  is she in charge now   no  i'll tell you when you can lower your weapons   hand over the bag   is that what this is about    i am dr  temperance brennan   i've been in guatemala for two months   identifying victims of genocide  including him   most people in this situation   what they do is they sweat it   guatemala  genocide   how are you scary after that     you know who doesn't sweat it    sociopaths   i'm not a sociopath   i'm an anthropologist at the jeffersonian   who works for the fbi   which i'd maybe believe if you had id that did more than  allowed you access to the cafeteria   you are illegally transporting human remains  ma'am   and you assaulted a homeland security agent   look  i'm sorry if i embarrassed you in front of your friends   but next time  you should identify yourself before attacking me   what are you doing here   fbi  special agent seeley booth   major crime investigation  dc   bones identifies bodies for us   don't call me bones   and i do more than identify   she also writes books   fine  she's all yours   great  let's grab your skull  and let's vamoose   what  that's it   she's all yours      why did you stop me    what does it matter  you're free to go   just grab your bags     you set me up   you got a hold for questioning request from the fbi  didn't you   i love this book   come on   that's the best you can do   what   getting homeland security to snatch me so you can stage a fake rescue   well  at least i picked you up at the airport  huh   come on  i mean  i went through the appropriate channels   but your assistant there  he stone walled me   yeah  well  after the last case  i told zack never ever to put you through   he's a good assistant  you can let me out anywhere along here   all right  listen   a decomposed corpse was found this morning at arlington national cemetery   arlington national cemetery is full of decomposed corpses   it's a cemetery   yeah  but this one is your type of corpse   it wasn't in a casket   if you drive one more block i'm screaming  kidnap  out the window     i'm trying to mend bridges here    pull over     i'm going home    great   could  we     look  could we just skip this part   i find you very condescending   me  i'm condescending   i'm not the one who's got to mention that she's got a doctorate every five minutes     i am the one with a doctorate    yeah  but i'm the one with the badge and the gun   you're not the only forensic anthropologist in town   yes  i am  the next nearest is in montreal   parlez vous fran ais   what's it going to take  huh     full participation in the case    fine   not just lab work  everything   well you want me to spit in my hand  we're scully and mulder   i don't know what that means   it's an olive branch   just get back in the car   what's the context of the find   routine landscaping    they drop the level of the pond   one of the workmen thought he saw something   hi  zack     this eco warrior look works for you    thanks   very action oriented   agent booth  you remember my assistant  zack addy   oh   yeah   how was guatemala   you dig up lots of massacred victims   learn a thing or two about machete strikes   zack  i need water samples and temperature readings from the pond   right  away  dr  brennan   he's got no sense of discretion  that kid   typical squint   i don't know what that means   well  cops get stuck  we bring in people like you   you know   squints     you know  who squint at things   oh  you mean people with very high iqs and basic reasoning skills   what  exactly  am i supposed to be squinting at   it's like pornography   you'll know it when you see it   yeah  ok     this is a crime scene   episode 1x01   pilot  transcript by raceman      only for  the remains are wrapped in four mil flat poly construction sheeting   pvc coated chicken wire   weighted   that's why the body didn't surface during decomposition   the skeleton is complete  but the skull is in fragments     what can you tell me    not much   she's a young woman   probably between 18 and 22   approximately five foot three   race unknown  delicate features   that's all   tennis player   how do you get a pretty tennis player out of that yuck   epiphysis fusion gives age   pelvic bone shape gives sex   bursitis in the shoulder   somebody this young  it must be an athletic injury   when did she die     eh       eh    what does that even mean   means wait until our bug and slime guy takes a look   no clothing   you know  in my line of work  no clothes usually means a sex crime   in my line of work  it can also mean the victim favored natural fibers   your suit  for example  will outlast your bones by decades   collect silt  three meters radius  to a depth of ten centimeters   your fbi forensics team can take the plastic and the chicken wire   we'll take the rest   dr  goodman  i wish you wouldn't just give me to the fbi   as a federally funded institution   the jeffersonian must seize every opportunity  to prove our worth to our friends in congress   which means i loan you out as i see fit   especially to federal agencies    loan out  implies property  dr  goodman   the fbi will never respect mere property   i do not view you as property  dr  brennan   you are one of the jeffersonian's most valuable assets   an asset is  by definition  property   what's the rule  mr  addy   you only converse with phds   you realize i'm halfway through two doctorates   two halves make a whole  so mathematically speaking     go polish a bone  mr  addy   dr  goodman   fbi agents will never respect any of us  as long as you simply dole out scientists like office temps   dr  brennan   are you playing me   you know i'm no good at that   mmm  thus far   but you have a disturbingly steep learning curve   the pond is not only warm and teeming with microbes   which accelerated decomposition   but it houses black carp and koi  which fed on the body   can i  as the only normal person in this room   say   ew    i got three larval stages of tricoptera  chironimidae     as we cut to the chase     the body was in the pond one winter and two summers   spring before last   do you really think i'm lusty   the book   no  no  no  you're not in the book   sure he is  we all are   no  none of you are in the book     those are fictitious characters based on      i found some small bone fragments in the silt   we're out of the book now     we're back in real life    i'd guess rana temporaria   frog bones   also  some tiny gold links  as from a fine chain   point of clarification    i'm not a virgin   nowhere near  in fact   who you captured perfectly is booth   buttoned down  but     buckets of sexual confidence which     oh  i  for one  would love to tap   it's not right to discuss tapping asses in front of the soaker   i can't bounce back and forth between my book and real life   since we're stuck with real life  let's just forget the book   i haven't analyzed whatever it was the victim was holding in her hand   but it looks like cellulose   paper   hmm  possibly   i found microscopic grit embedded in the skull fragments   i need you to identify those  too   remove the remaining tissue   i'll debride the skull fragments myself   reassemble it so angela can put a face on our victim   good  i prefer holographs   they don't stink   zack     i don't like those terms for human remains     soaker    crispy critter      i know  dr  brennan   the dawn is breaking   a light shining through  you're barely waking   and i'm tangled up in you  yeah      but i'm hoping your close  well  i follow your car   i worry i won't see your face   light up again   even the best fall down sometimes   even the wrong words seem to rhyme   out of the doubt that fills my mind   i somehow find  you and i collide   collide   so  you guaranteed a squint a field role in an active murder investigation   yes  sir     the one that wrote the book    yes  sir   thought you said she wouldn't work with you anymore   the last case we worked   she provided a description of the murder weapon and the murderer   but i didn't give her much credence   why not   because she did it by looking at the victim's autopsy x rays   well  i wouldn't give it much credence  either   turns out she was right on both   plus  the pond victim    brennan gives me the victim's age  sex and favorite sport     which is    tennis     she's good    no  she's amazing   only way i can get her back on my side  is to bring her out in the field     i'm willing   fine  she's on you   take a squint out in the field  she's your responsibility   yes  sir   peter   it's not rational for you to choose the first day i'm back  to reclaim your television   while you were away  i thought a lot about why we broke up   we fought all the time and don't like each other anymore   we fought because you were emotionally distant and cold   but sexually speaking  i think you'll agree     you  didn't come for your tv  you timed this for a booty call   okay  you're leaving   your intimacy issues are probably due to being orphaned so young   i hate psychology  and you're just horny   brennan  do you really want to spend the rest of your life alone   i don't know about the rest of my life   but i sure as hell wish i was alone right now   so  what  we split the cost of the tv   good bye   what   this is interesting  angela   good morning   does booth know how this works   this computer program  which i designed    patent pending    accepts a full array of digital input   processes it and then projects it  as a three dimensional holographic image   okay     you get that    yeah  the patent pending part   brennan reassembled the skull and applied tissue markers   her skull was badly damaged  but racial indicators    cheekbone dimensions  nasal arch  occipital measurements    suggest african american   and     we have our victim   i have to admit  that's pretty cool   ange  rerun the program  does she look familiar to anyone   split the difference  mixed race   lenny kravitz or vanessa williams   i don't know what that means   angela  reduce tissue depth over the cheekbones to the jawline   does anyone recognize her     not me    wait   is that who i think it is   the girl who had the affair with the senator   her name's cleo louise eller     only daughter to ted and sharon eller   last seen approximately 9 00 p m    april 6 2003  leaving the cardio deluxe jam on k street   she didn't even make it to her car   pretty good memory   yeah  well  it's my job to find her   in that case  congratulations on your success   this isn't exactly the way i wanted it to end   cleo eller is not just some missing girl   yeah  she's a senate intern who was boinking senator allan bethlehem   i was secondary in the investigation into the disappearance of that girl   and we couldn't confirm that   how did you recognize her before she even had her own face   i recognized the underlying architecture of her features   the rest is just window dressing   i'm not an expert  but shouldn't he be happier     oh  no  believe me  i'm happy    you seem happy to me   i need this kept quiet   ah  cover up   paranoid conspiracy theory   is it paranoia that monica lewinsky was a kgb trained sex agent mole   so what do you do first  confront the senator     listen  bones  i know      don't call me bones   i know we talked about you coming out in the field and all       oh  you rat bastard    but if it's this big   the director's gonna create a special investigation unit   and if line all my ducks up in a row  i can maybe head it up   i don't know what that means  but i think i can be a duck   you're not a duck  okay  on this one  we stick to the book   cops on the streets  squints in the lab   in that case  the jeffersonian will be issuing a press release  identifying the girl in the pond   you do that  i'm a dead duck   what are you trying to do   blackmail you   blackmail a federal agent     i don't like it    i'm fairly certain you're not supposed to   fine  you're in   you're certain it's cleo eller   the profile's dead on   age  race  height   plus  the timeline fits   i mean  cleo eller did play tennis in college   talk  to me about the senator   cleo eller  the victim  worked for senator bethlehem     it was reported that they were involved sexually    we couldn't confirm that   well  bethlehem's a hound  everybody knows that   ken thompson  cleo's boyfriend   thompson's still bethlehem's aide   thompson keeps bethlehem's calendar   no way the senator has an affair that thompson doesn't know about   no sexual relationship  no motive   what about the nut case   oliver laurier   do you like him for this   he's a stalker   what's your first move   i'd like to inform the ellers that we found their daughter   it's better to keep this quiet   it's been  what  two years   what's another few days   all due respect  sir  i've come to know the family pretty well   especially the major  and two years is a hell of a long time in limbo   i'll have details of cause of death by this afternoon   that's where we'll get started   all right   hodgins identified the particulates embedded in cleo eller's skull as rolled steel    most likely from a sledge type hammer   also  there's cement and diatomaceous earth     what's that    looks like that   it's made up of prehistoric sea creatures   it's used as an insecticide  filtering agent   cleaning abrasive  ceramics   it's very common   diatomaceous earth common or not  it's a clue   you're positive it's our cleo   we established 22 matching points of comparison     we're certain   did he do it   the senator   one military man to another   major eller  we can't discuss the investigation in any way   can you at least tell us if our daughter suffered   given the state of her skull     cleo never saw it coming   thank you   mrs  eller  could you tell us what cleo wore around her neck   her father's bronze star   ted won it in the first gulf war   and he gave it to her for luck   those people deserve the truth   their daughter was murdered  they deserve the kindness of a lie   there will bean inquest report   which they won't read because they don't want to   especially because toward the end   cleo and her parents weren't even speaking   they told you that   getting information out of live people is a lot different than  getting information out of a pile of bones   you have to offer up something of yourself first   what exactly did you do in the military   see   see what you did right there  bones   you asked a personal question without offering anything personal in return   and since i'm not a skeleton  you get zilch  sorry   there are stab marks here   and odd markings on the distal phalanges   nothing i've seen before   in a nutshell  anxious  depressed and nauseous     take a sick day    not me  cleo eller   people casings show she was on lorazepam   chlordiazepoxide and meclizine hydrochloride   nausea     show me those bone fragments   these aren't frog bones   cleo eller was pregnant     fetal remains    malleus  incus  stapes   these are fetal ear bones     the girl was pregnant    not very far along   you want me to try and get a dna reading  see if we can prove paternity   you can try  let's hope there's enough genetic material to test   this senator  oh  he is smart   he gets an intern pregnant   then murders her when it threatens his career   and he has the connections to get away with it   i hate it when you make paranoia plausible  it's like sliding off a cliff   this special unit  no way your fbi pal heads it up   unless the dark powers in charge are convinced he knows where his political bread is buttered   either way  that's where this investigation ends   stay for life  for life      want to get a drink   non topical application   glug glug  whoo hoo   come on  sweetie   what if booth's right   what if i'm only good with bones and lousy with people     people like you    i don't care if men like me   okay  interesting leap from  people  to  men      but i'm sure it means nothing    i hate psychology   my most meaningful relationships are with dead people     who said that    it's true   i understand cleo  and her bones are all i've ever seen   when she was seven  she broke her wrist  probably falling off a bike   and two weeks later  before the cast was even removed   she got right back on that bike and broke it all over again   and when she was being murdered  she fought back hard even though        she was so depressed she could hardly get up in the morning   she didn't welcome death   cleo wanted to live   honey     you ever think that maybe you come off a little distant because you connect too much   i hate psychology  it's a soft science   i know  but     people are mostly soft   except for their bones   you want some advice   glug glug  whoo hoo   offer up a little bit of yourself every once in a while   just     tell somebody something you're not completely certain you want them to know   that's the second time i've received that advice   well  you know i give great advice   i'm going to have to push this to the next level   i'm a little confused as to why the director of the fbi would send you  to speak to the senator instead of coming himself   probably because i'm the one that found that cleo eller was pregnant   you could tell the girl was pregnant from her skeleton   we found fetal bones   the only question  senator  is which one of you is the father   are you willing to submit to a dna test   you know what  given the sensitivity  don't say anything on the subject  without your attorney present  that's my advice   advice i intend to take   ken  we have a vote to get to   what are you doing   saliva  say from chewing gum  is an excellent source of dna   i intend to compare it to the dna in the fetal bones   you need a warrant for that   ken  she needs a warrant   we have any further questions  we'll be in touch   ken  you okay   i could place you under arrest on a federal charge right now  for uttering threats against a united states senator     what    bones     i own her  but she was your responsibility    yes  sir   send in special agent furst   i warned you about taking squints out to the field   but you vouched for her  said she wouldn't screw up     yes  sir    no  no   booth didn't know that i was going to see the senator   i wanted to get a sample of his dna     exactly    not helping   tomorrow morning i'm announcing the formation of a special unit  to investigate the murder of cleo eller   at which time your investigation will be officially terminated   you will not head the new unit   congratulations  patrick     no hard feelings    right   i need the complete case files in the morning   of course  they'll be ready   thank you  agent furst   well  at least dr  brennan found out that senator bethlehem was having sex with cleo   i did   the report said there wasn't enough dna in the fetal bones to determine paternity   senator bethlehem didn't want dr  brennan to take that gum   he's hiding something   he didn't know there wasn't enough dna   i suggest that you  uh  go back to your lab  dr  brennan  and get used to being there   come on  bones   don't be nice to me after i got you in trouble   your heart was in the right place   i'm not a heart person  you're a heart person   i'm a brain person     you vouched for me    forget it   no  i won't   you think it was the senator   the senator's had sex with a dozen of these interns  and he hasn't killed any of them  my best bet is still the stalker   you want to check him out   we can  um  what do you call it  roost him   roust     the murderer snatched the bronze star from cleo's neck  so     i got 12 hours before this case is over and i'm off it  so let's go roust him  come on   mr  laurier  we have a warrant to search your apartm     don't run  oliver   agent booth is under the impression  that you might have something pertinent to a case he's working on   you're looking for a bronze star   like the one cleo wore   exactly like that one  mr  laurier   i don't have it   sometimes stalkers retain keepsakes   what the hell are these things  huh   miniature lives of the saints     i hand them out      heads up  bones   i hand them out for donations   i'm not a panhandler  help yourself   i never stalked cleo   then why'd she get a restraining order   first of all  no   ken thompson  her supposed boyfriend  got the restraining order   with his boss  the senator   but ken is only concerned with his job and his tropical fish   they colluded to ruin my reputation  with this specious  stalker  label  when  in actuality        i was cleo's close friend   then why'd you run from the warrant   my fight or flight response is heavily weighted towards flight   if there's anything i can do     to help you catch cleo's killer  just tell me   oh  a full confession  that would be great   i love cleo   why would i hurt her   if you don't mind  i'm gonna keep one of these little books   whatever you need     dr  brennan   this is a rough composite  but you get the idea   skull trauma was not the cause of death   cleo was stabbed first   she was stabbed five to eight times with a military issue k bar knife   i just completed this rendering   the defensive wounds to the bones of her hands  suggest that it wasn't until the third or the fourth penetration     that's likely the fatal stab  right there      that cleo stopped fighting back   i believe that the distinctive damage  to her distal phalanges    the tips of her finger bones    was caused by the murderer using the knife to remove herfinger pads   cranial fragmentation suggests a 20 pound hammer  striking four to five times while the victim's head rested on a cement floor  containing traces of diatomaceous earth   that's the best explanation for the particulates found in her skull   this was not a crime of passion   cleo never saw the first stab coming   it didn't arise out of an argument   why smash cleo's face   why whittle away her fingertips  remove her clothing and her jewelry   sink her body     the murderer put more effort into hiding the victim's identity  than he did into the murder itself   in case cleo was identified  the murderer planted evidence   the little book brennan got from the stalker matches the cellulose found in cleo's hand   military cemetery  military knife  implicates her own father  more misdirection   sound like any conniving son of a bitch senators you know   you expect me to declare war on a united states senator  based on your little holographic crystal ball   it's not magic   it's a logical recreation of events based on evidence     it's no more valid than my gut    a good hypothesis with stands testing   that's what makes it a good hypothesis   not a hypothesis  you have a dead girl and a united states senator   this is exactly why squints belong in the lab   you guys don't know anything about the real world   come on  we're done here   touchy   you must know about her family   both parents vanish when she's 15   probably counts as the real world   yeah  i know the story   i read the file   the cops never found out anything   brennan figures that     maybe if somebody like her had been there     well  for somebody who hates psychology   she sure has a lot of it   thought i'd find you here   you know  you being a good shot and doing martial arts   it's all your way of dealing   i mean  who knows better than you how fragile life can be   maybe an army ranger sniper who became an fbi homicide investigator   oh  you looked me up  huh   do you mind     be my guest    thank you   were you any good at being a sniper   a sniper gets to know a little something about killers   senator bethlehem  he's no killer   oh  and oliver laurier is   way i read laurier  he's unhinged   that makes him dangerous   that'd be your  gut  telling you that  correct   you know  homicides   they're not solved by scientists   they're solved by guys like me asking a thousand questions a thousand times   catching people telling lies every time   you're great at what you do  bones  but     you don't solve murders     cops do   cleo eller was killed on a cement floor sprinkled with diatomaceous earth   traces of her blood will still be in that cement   one of us is wrong  maybe both of us   but if bethlehem wasn't a senator   you'd be right there in his basement looking for that killing floor   you're afraid of him   your hypothesis is that squints don't solve murders and cops do   prove it   be a cop   booth   they look pretty happy  don't they   otherwise they wouldn't turn on the camera  i guess   zack said you wanted to see me   something you don't like to talk about    families   temperance     partners  they share things   builds trust   since when are we partners   i apologize for the assumption   you got a warrant to search bethlehem's place   you were right    if bethlehem wasn't a senator   i'd be in that basement  looking for that killing floor   but you're wrong   i was never afraid of that guy   and i'm not doing this because you're a genius   i'm doing this for cleo   sir  it's john ferris  channel 11  sir   here  sir   the warrant says they're searching for blood traces   a sledgehammer and diatomaceous earth   what the hell is that   you're making a big mistake   i'm only in charge     you're coming in and mess up my investigation   care to make a statement  senator   senator bethlehem  can you just answer a couple questions   yeah  go ahead   who gave you this warrant  when was it delivered   what are you doing here   look at him  for all his politics  he's got nothing   he should've loved cleo properly  like i would've   will you sign my book   stalk me  oliver  and i will kick your ass   i don't recognize that   that is not mine   that is not mine     at least we got the hammer    yeah  but that's all we got   cement floor in the basement   yeah  but no blood  no diatomaceous earth   we needed a trifecta  bones   physical evidence  murder weapon  crime scene   they wouldn't even arrest him   don't worry   if that's the hammer used on cleo eller  he'll get arrested   a toast     to getting the murderous bastard   the hammer's not enough   he's going to get away with it   maybe booth is right  maybe outside the lab  i'm useless   let us take guidance from the lives of the saints   albertus magnus  patron saint of scientists   i thought magnus was the patron saint of fishmongers   two separate entities   albertus magnus was a 13th century philosopher   the fishmonger saint was     fish   you said that diatomaceous earth could be used as a filtering agent   yeah  for swimming pools  water filters     or tropical fish   oliver laurier said that ken thompson kept fish   what's your hurry   thompson read the warrant  he knows we're looking for diatomaceous earth   get in touch with booth   tell him where i'm going  okay   she didn't actually say where she was going  did she   stop  you can't destroy evidence   this is a private residence  i don't suppose you have a warrant   i'm working with the fbi   if i have reasonable suspicion of a crime being committed   i don't need a warrant   what crime   destruction of evidence pertinent to a federal investigation   i'm just cleaning up   is that alcoholy smell on your breath
