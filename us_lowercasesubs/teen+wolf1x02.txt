you okay   get away from me   stiles     what happened   you tried to kill me   it's like i told you before   it's the anger   it's your pulse rising   it's a trigger   but that's lacrosse   it's a pretty violent game  if you hadn't noticed   well  it's gonna be a lot more violent  if you end up killing someone on the field   you can't play saturday   you're gonna have to get out of the game   i'm first line   not anymore   hey   late shift again for me   but i am taking saturday off to see your first game   oh  mom  you can't   oh  no  i can and i will   come on  one shift isn't gonna break us   completely   hey  what's wrong with your eyes   you look like you haven't slept in days   oh  uh  it's nothing   i'm just   stressed   just stress   nothin' else   homework   i mean  it's not like you're on drugs or anything  right   right now   right now   i'm sorry  what do you mean  right now    have you ever taken drugs   have you   get some sleep   what'd you find out   well  it's bad   jackson's got a separated shoulder   because of me   because he's a tool   well  is he gonna play   well  they don't know yet   now they're just counting on you for saturday   what   it looks like what   come on   damn it   what   i saw you on the field   wha what are you talking about   you shifted in front of them   if they find out what you are   they find out about me   about all of us   and it is not just the hunters after us   it's everyone   but   they didn't see anything   i  s swear  i    and they won't   because if you even try to play  in that game on saturday     i'm gonna kill you myself   what do you mean  you can't play the game tomorrow night    i mean   i can't play the game tomorrow night   you can't wait to play the game tomorrow night   no  coach  i can't play the game tomorrow night   i'm not following   i'm having some personal issues   is it a girl   no   is it a guy   you know  our goalie danny is gay   yeah  i know  coach  but that's not it   you don't think danny's a     good lookin' guy   i   think he's good looking   i  but i  i like girls   and that's not it  anyway  i i    what  is it drugs   are you doing meth   because i had a brother that was addicted to meth   you should have seen what it did to his teeth    they were all cracked and rotted   it was  it was disgusting   my   god   what happened to him   he got veneers   is  is that what this is about   are you afraid of getting hurt  mccall   no   i'm     having some issues dealing with aggression   well  here's the good news   that's why you play lacrosse   problem solved   coach  i can't play the game tomorrow night   listen  mccall  part of playing first line  is taking on the responsibility of being first line   now  if you can't shoulder that responsibility   then you're back on the bench until you're ready   if i don't play the game   you're taking me off first line   mccall  play the game   slide it up and half asleep  hey   hey   busy   no  no  it's just  uh   my mom  she's nothing   i mean  it's nothing   uh  i'm never busy for you   i like the sound of that   i have to run to french class   but i wanted you to know that  i'm coming to see you play tomorrow   you are   and we're all going out afterwards   you  me  lydia  jackson   it's gonna be great   tell stiles to come too   uh  save me a seat at lunch  i gotta go   oh  god   why is there a rumor going around  that you're not playing tomorrow   'cause i'm sort of not   i think you sort of are   especially when you brutally  injure my boyfriend by ramming into him   he brutally injured himself ramming into me   jackson's gonna play tomorrow   but he's not gonna be at his peak   and i prefer my boyfriend at peak performance   okay   i date the captain of the winning lacrosse team   and if they start off the season losing   i date the captain of the losing lacrosse team   i don't date losers   losing one game isn't gonna kill anyone   in fact  it might even save someone   fine  don't play   we'll probably win anyway   then we'll go out after  like we were planning     and i'll introduce allison to  all the hot players on the team   and scott mccall can stay home   surfing the net for porn   mr  mccall  you're not even close to solving your problem   tell me about it   hey  come here   what   come here   tell me what they're saying   can you hear 'em   want everyone under the age of 18 to be in their home by 9 30 p m   we'd like to institute the curfew  effective immediately   look  we don't     curfew because of the body   unbelievable   my dad's out looking for a rabid animal  while the jerk off  who actually killed the girl is just hangin' out   doing whatever he wants   well  you can't exactly tell  your dad the truth about derek   i can do something   like what   find the other half of the body   are you kidding   this is allison   hi   nice to meet you   she's the new girl   she just moved here   oh  how do you like it   i like it   so lydia's introducing you to everyone   she's being so unbelievably nice to me   i wonder why   maybe she gets how much being the new girl can suck   where did you get that   my jacket   it was in my locker   i think lydia brought it back from the party   she has my combination    did she say she brought it back  or did somebody give her the jacket   like who   like derek   your friend   he's not my friend   how much did you talk to him  when he drove you home   mmm  not much at all   what did you say   i   gotta get to class   allison    no  i really have to go   derek   derek   stay away from her   she doesn't know anything   yeah   what if she does   you think your little buddy stiles  can just google werewolves   and now you got all the answers  is that it   you don't get it yet  scott   but i'm looking out for you   think about what could happen   you're out on the field   the aggression takes over   and you shift in front of everyone   your mom  all your friends   and when they see you     everything falls apart   what did you find   how did you find it   where did you find it   and  yes  i've had a lot of adderall  so     i found something of derek hale's   are you kidding  what   there's something buried there    i could smell blood   that's awesome   i mean  that's terrible   whose blood   i don't know   but when we do  your dad nails derek for the murder   and then you help me figure out  how to play lacrosse without changing   because there's no way i'm not playing that game   hey   okay   good luck  i guess        hey  lydia   you probably don't remember me   um  i sit behind you in biology   uh  anyway  i always thought  that we just had this kind of connection   unspoken  of course   maybe it'd be kind of cool to   get to know each other a little better   hold on  give me a second   yeah  i didn't get any of what you just said   is it worth repeating   no   sorry   i'll just sit   you don't care   okay   did he do it   he said not to make a habit of it   but one cortitisone shot won't kill me   you should get one right before the game too   the pros do it all the time   you want to be a little high school amateur   or   do you want to go     pro   ohh  god   the scent was the same   you sure   yes   so he did bury the other half of the body on his property   which means we have proof he killed the girl   i say we use it   how   tell me something first   are you doing this because you want to stop derek   or because you want to play in the game   and he said you couldn't   there are bite marks on the legs  stiles  bite marks   okay   then we're gonna need a shovel   wait  something's different   different how   i don't know   let's just get this over with   this is taking way too long   just keep going   what if he comes back   when we get the hell out of here   what if he catches us   i have a plan for that   which is   you run one way   i run the other   whoever he catches first  too bad   i hate that plan   oh  stop  stop  stop   hurry   i'm trying  did he have to  tie the thing in  like  900 knots   i'll do it   what the hell is that   it's a wolf   yeah  i can see that   i thought you said you smelled blood  as in human blood   i told you something was different   this doesn't make sense   we gotta get out of here   yeah   okay  help me cover this up   what's wrong   you see that flower   what about it   i think it's wolfsbane   what's that   uh   haven't you ever seen the wolf man   no   lon chaney jr    claude rains   the original  classic werewolf movie   no  what   you are so unprepared for this   stiles   holy     no   oh  god   okay  just so you know   i'm not afraid of you   okay  maybe i am   doesn't matter   i just wanna know something   the girl you killed     she was a werewolf   she was a different kind  wasn't she   i mean  she could turn herself into an actual wolf   and i know scott can't do that   is that why you killed her   why are you so worried about me  when it's your friend who's the problem   when he shifts on the field   what do you think they're gonna do   just keep cheering him on   i can't stop him from playing  but you can   and  trust me     you want to   there  stand   what the hell do you think you're doing   i'm just trying to help   okay  well  how 'bout you help me understand  exactly how you came across this   we were looking for scott's inhaler   which he dropped when   the other night   the other night when you were out here  looking for the first half of the body   yes   the night that you told me you were alone  and scott was at home   yes   no  oh  crap   so you lied to me   that depends on how you define lying   well  i define it as not telling the truth   how do you define it   mm  reclining your body in a horizontal position     get the hell out of here     absolutely   i can't find anything about wolfsbane being used for burial   just keep looking   maybe it's like a ritual or something   like maybe they bury you as a wolf   or maybe it's like a special skill  you know   like something you have to learn   i'll put it on my to do list   right underneath figuring out how the hell  i'm playing this game tonight   maybe it's different for girl werewolves   okay  stop it   stop what   stop saying  werewolves    stop enjoying this so much   are you okay   no  no  i'm not   i'm so far from being okay   you know  you're gonna have to accept this   scott  sooner or later   i can't   well  you're gonna have to   no  i can't breathe  aah   ah  pull over   why  what's happening   you kept it   what was i supposed to do with it   stop the car   okay     okay   we're good  you can     scott   scott   odd how   uh  like an odd person or     a dog like individual roaming the streets   i'm hanging up on you now   no  wai wai wai wai wait   good bye   dad   dad  what the hell are you doing   he  he came out of nowhere  allison   are you trying to kill him   no  no  of course not   he just  he just ran out into the driveway   i'm sorry     it's my fault  i'm sorry    you okay   yeah  y yeah  i'm fine   i swear   sorry i hit your car   i was just coming to say hi   you sure you're okay   yeah   yeah  completely   uhh  i should go  i've got a     lacrosse game to get to   you're still coming  right   of course i'm coming   we both are   you gonna try to convince me not to play   i just hope you know what you're doing   if i don't play  i lose first line and allison   allison's not going anywhere   and it's one game that you really don't need to play   i wanna play   i wanna be on the team   i wanna go out with allison   i want a semi freaking normal life   do you get that   i get it   just try not to worry too much while you're out there  okay   or get too angry   i got it   or stressed   i got it   don't think about allison being in the stands   or that her father's trying to kill you   or that derek's trying to kill you   or the girl he killed   or that you might kill someone   if a hunter doesn't kill you first    i'm sorry   i'll stop   good luck   scott     i just want you to remember one thing for tonight   uh   winning isn't everything   nobody likes a loser   how's your shoulder   it's fine   you feel any pain   no   what if i gave it a big ol' punch   would you  would you feel any pain then   maybe   listen  just go out there   just give it your best   if you feel any pain  just
