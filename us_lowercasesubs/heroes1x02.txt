previously on heroes   five strangers accross the globe  began to discover they have extraordinary abilities   from the cheerleader who realized she's invincible   i have busted every bone in my body

meant  to do something extraordinary   and as a son seeks the truth by finishing his father's work     i spoke to him 2 days ago   he was this close to finding the 1st of them   he's forced to run from a man surrounded in mystery   he left everything behind but his computer   a man who's more conencted than anyone imagine     hi  daddy    hey  baby   and now heroes continues   chapter two don't look back   we all imagine ourselves the agents of our destiny   capable of determining our own fate   but have we truly any choice in when we rise   or when we fall   or does a force larger than ourselves bid us our direction   is it evolution that takes us by the hand   does science point our way   or is it god who intervenes  keeping us safe     whoa  whoa  easy  buddy    where am i   you're in a hospital   what happened     you don't remember    no   you jumped  pete     jumped    yeah   off the roof of a  you tried to kill yourself  you were a little wound up yesterday   but i

of reading it   well  he most definitely would have gotten a kick out of it   that's very thoughtful   you know  he told me he was being watched   i thought that he was just eccentric   i like that you didn't use the word  paranoid    do you think that they're watching you now   they could have killed me  if that's what they wanted   for the time being  it seems i'm more important to them alive   you said that he talked to you about his theories and the map   i need you to tell me everything he said to you   everything you remember  everything   girls  this isn't a     criminal investigation

suicide attempts  both of them   he finally got what he wanted   when he was 23  he was diagnosed with major depressive disorder   he couldn't help it  it was just who he was   why didn't i know about any of this before   your father and i decided not to tell you since the  disorder can have a genetic link  and you were always so sensitive   we didn't want you to worry about it   but you're telling me now   it can start with delusions of grandeur   thinking you're invincible or indestructible   they are irrational thoughts that then turn suicidal   it's time you took a hard look at your life
