previously on  dexter      tonight's the night   and it's going to happen again and again     has to happen   there he is  he's the one   you're mine now  so do exactly as i say   you better be a cop  no    forensics   there is no blood near the body at all   it's the weirdest thing you ever saw   i've never seen such clean  dry  neat looking dead flesh   how does the killer get rid of the blood   one of these days  you're gonna tell me   i told you blood spatter doesn't take up all my time   how the hell was your date with rita last night  great   she's perfect because rita is   in her own way  as damaged as me   open your eyes and look at what you did   please  you have to understand   trust me  i definitely understand   hello   what are you doing now   just finishing up a little project  but i'll come by later   they found another hooker   that's the third one in five months   third  you mean there's a     serial killer  that's right   there are people out there who do really bad things   you have to learn how to spot them  but i can teach you   the killer flayed the skin  the flesh  completely off   now  why would he do that   he's experimenting  he trying to find the right way   he's certainly raising the bar  damn  this guy is good   the killer is an artist   you give me the fucking creeps   yeah  i know  sorry about that   but now we have a fourth body  and the cuts were different   and that's telling us a story  the ritual is changing   i'd like to check and see if any refrigerated trucks  have been stolen in the last week or so   it just seems odd   your sister has this ice truck theory   and then here you are to back it up   she's good  lieutenant  you should give her a chance   i think this is a friendly message    hey  want to play    and  yes  i want to play  i really  really do    i dream   i dream i'm floating on the surface of my own life   watching it unfold  observing it   i'm the outsider  looking in   ho ho   ha ha   yeah   oh  you want to play  man   come on   in the water  aah   whoa   look at them  they can laugh and play   it comes so easily for them   even though i'm not one of them   even though sometimes i can really be a monster     today  i'm just     a sea monster   soon enough  i'll have to go back to doing what i do     so i make a point of enjoying days like this  when i have them   just a second   the ice truck killer left me a gruesome souvenir   explaining it could be kind of     awkward   hey   bagels  brother    let me in   could it be more depressing in here   got anything to drink  it's hot as hell out there   o j    with ice   so  how you doing   i'm fine   yeah  things are fine   breakfast  which i already had  was fine   but you know me    i'm always hungry   mmm   so  what's up  hotshot   all right  get this     lieutenant's looking for that refrigerated truck  in every swamp  glade  and chop shop  from here to the keys   but the way i see it   that whackjob truck driver  threw a severed head at your car   it's not as if he's shy   you think he's hiding the truck in plain sight   wanting it to be found   i could answer that  if laguerta didn't have me back with my hookers   finding that truck is your golden ticket into homicide   just because laguerta has you looking for hookers on her time  doesn't mean you can't look for the truck     on my time   hmm  what's with these   i've got court   why is it we never talk brother sister stuff   our dad was a cop  you're a cop   i work for the cops   for us  this is brother sister stuff   brings out your eyes   first he throws a severed head at me   then he leaves me these doll parts   like pieces of a puzzle   i like puzzles   but there's nothing more frustrating  than putting a puzzle together  and finding that it still doesn't make sense   please state your name and occupation   my name is dexter morgan  and i'm a forensics specialist  in blood spatter analysis  for the miami metro police department   and how long have you been doing blood spatter analysis   almost 12 years   you've been involved in quite a few cases  then    give or take   no  2 103   then it's safe to say blood is your life   safe to say   unlike the other guys down at the station   i love coming to court to rub shoulders  with the good people of the sunshine state     and sasquatch   in a courthouse  everyone's on their best behavior        like they're being watched   and they are   some people would look at this family  and see only tragedy and heartbreak   but i see so much more than that   i'll do this  okay   i see opportunity   alexander pryce finished his homework  kissed his mom   went out for a jog   he told her he'd be back in time to take out the trash cans   just another night  until     until the defendant not only struck him with his car  but fled the scene   leaving alexander pryce alone and dying for hours  before his body was found the next morning     from heinous to unspeakable   the people will prove that not only did mr  chambers  strike and kill alexander pryce  but did so while once again under the influence of alcohol   happy birthday  alex   thank you   rip right into it  what   yeah  hope it's money   yeah  you wish   oh   thanks  guys  it's like 80 degrees out   but next year at this time   we're coming to visit you at harvard   it's everything i've ever wanted for you  alexander   thanks  dad   all right  enough corniness   dexter  i see their pain   on some level  i even understand their pain   i just can't feel their pain   it just a matter of time before we see how far  matt chambers's crocodile tears will get him   but until then   a little of my favorite tropical fruit     the perfect driving food next to a pulled pork sandwich   also  i can keep my energy up for the day job    ven conmigo        junto a mi coraz n     y me quite la vida si no tengo tu amor    detective   buena  buena   did we get an i d    first on scene pulled the wallet   we're still waiting   hello  dex   her boss    lieutenant laguerta   in keeping with her total sense of entitlement   she has this attraction to me   and i thought i was creepy   given the skin rupture and the secondary spatter   distance had to be a 50   60 foot drop   the eastbound's only 40 feet   it's not high enough for this kind of damage   so  best guess  originating point is the westbound causeway   hey  get me a team on the westbound causeway   oh  she's good   angel  look at this   i think there's something in his mouth   medic   ohh   ah  it's just a death rattle  he's gonzo   you better check out my friend  too   no telling what this guy might have had   this is what he had   call me crazy  angel  but i think this is human flesh   hooked up with sean last night   the cable guy sean   oh  god  no   he smelled like cheese   so the mechanic sean   yep   he came over   we opened a bottle of pinot gris   we finished a bottle of pinot gris   before i knew it  we were     stop that   you don't want to hear this  do you   no   but if you two are getting serious  i'd love to meet him   why don't you and sean the mechanic  join me and rita the girlfriend for dinner tomorrow night   why  so you can tell me later  he's not good enough for your little sister   don't   you're the one who was going on about brother and sister stuff   that becomes brother and sister double dating   come on  it'll be fun   all right  we'll go  but i'm not promising we'll have any fun   not now   what crawled up his ass   he hates lab rats   well  here's a headline     it's lab rats that make us cops look good   okay  listen up   we just got an i d  on the body from under the causeway   his name is ricky simmons   he was a cop   let me ask you something  yeah   when we were partners  you used to use every excuse in the book  to get out of making a next of kin notification   i knew ricky from the department softball team   he was a good guy  a good cop  it's the least i could do   motherfucker   call it in    we need e m t  and police backup now   i'll check the house   kara  it's me  it's james   you're okay   hey  it's me   it's okay   this is so fucked up  man   going after a cop's family     who would do such a thing   that's why we're here   but it's still fucked up   they're telling me ricky simmons was under deep cover  in carlos guerrero's family   all right  thanks   he'd been working the gig for 10 months  and everything was good   but this  going after his wife     guerrero's crossing a whole new line   now he's gone and pissed off  the entire miami police department   is there any word on the wife   she should be in surgery by now    qu  pas    uh  there's an inconsistency somewhere   and that would be   i'm not sure  but it's the answer to a question  we haven't thought of yet   look   whose is it  probably hers   ricky simmons  her husband    last number dialed   i got it   good work  angel   well  actually  it was dexter   uh  sergeant    ladies and gentlemen  we have a new world record   stop it   can't stop  must tickle   got to hear the magic word   i have your magic word right here    chocolate chip   cookies  ooh   homemade   okay  you guys   take your cookies into the bedroom   two each   but you never let us eat in our bedroom   well  i want some alone time with dexter   are you gonna kiss him   actually  yes   cool   gross   cookie   i wuv cookies   well  you're snarfing them down like the cookie monster   this isn't snarfing  this is eating with enthusiasm   tell me about your day   mmm  i had court    you know  the blood thing   and then a crime scene and more blood   mmm  i don't know how you do it   well  blood is     my life      my job   lately  the thing that surprises me most about rita  is how much i like being with her   but whenever that happens with a woman   when i feel comfortable with her  it all goes wrong   that's why i think it's best to take it one step at a time   hey  you know  deb has been all over me  for us to get together with her new boyfriend   you think you can get a babysitter some night   you mean an actual grown up meal   i'd love that  make a date   i pick you   and i pick my sister to chaperon   sister   so  miami's the haystack   and the ice truck's the needle  right   okay   and  brother  i just found the fucking needle   how did you find it   i put the word out with patrol     you know  the whole hide in plain sight thing   juan pierre flagged this one and called me   this is a busy street  anyone see the driver   the restaurant manager said it was here when he opened up   is this the one you saw   i feel like a kid at his own surprise party   this is the same truck   it's hard to say  it all happened so fast   let's go on a nonforensic geek limb here and say that it is   why is it still running   it keeps the back compartment refrigerated   dios m o   holy shit  they're fucking fingertips   clean slices  no blood   my guess is he drained the body entirely  before these cuts were made   how'd he do that    some kind of pump   no   i had forensics do a workup on our last victim   our guy's old school   yeah  he hoists the body up  severs the jugular   the heart does all the work   it's the most effective method  really   fucking butcher   there are 206 bones in the human body   he could have left any one of them   but he gave us exactly what we need to identify the victim   like he's leaving a trail of bread crumbs   who made the find   officer morgan   harry's daughter  huh   must be in the genes  her and her brother   this truck's a good get   it's their first solid lead   i encourage all my officers to think outside the box   well  nice work  lieutenant   i got the deputy mayor   congratulate morgan for me   mm hmm   another beautiful miami day     mutilated corpses with the chance of afternoon showers   chalk one up for miami metro  eh  ma'am   last time i checked  morgan  i'm the lieutenant   which means my officers keep me apprised  at all times on all things   you pull a stunt like that again   it won't matter who your father was   okay   dude  is this blood   it's chocolate  it's on your shirt  too   oh  it's a new shirt   what is taking so long   it's a big truck   they won't find anything  not even a tic tac   he's thought all this through   i know i would   your famous hunches telling you anything   ice cold   you're a goddamn riot   this fucking guy's toying with us   deb's right   this truck's not another piece of the puzzle        they are   watching ice melt    this is fun   stand a little closer  morgan  and i'll melt your heart   i think he's got a crush on you  dex   huh   yo  i was talking to morgan the sister   vince masuka only swings one way   yeah  from vine to vine   enough   i'm glad to see the sexual harassment seminar  really paid off   oh  this is seriously fucked up  my friends   why go to all this trouble   what's this sick son of a bitch trying to tell us   not  us    me   my freezer  the painted doll's fingernails     i think he's trying to impress me     and it's working   what  a man can't call his wife three times in one day   s   claro   bueno   kiss my baby and tell her   daddy be homepara la cena    i'm getting another call   yeah  te amo   batista    de veras  i'll be there in two minutes   she's still in surgery   the doctors are hopeful   ice truck killer returns  dead undercover cop     it's a typical day in the neighborhood   you got to hear this   ricky  where the fuck are you   i'm gonna try for the back door   ohh  oh  fuck  he saw me   oh  please don't hurt me   lieutenant   national database kicked back the dna match   norberto cervantes   let me see that   dame  ahora   es tu d a de mala suerte   estoy agradecido por tu lealdad   el gusto es m o  patr n   get down  police   put your hands up  police   put your hands up  get them down   put your fucking hands up  put your hands up   hey   is that necessary   it's a dangerous world  guerrero   yes  and one can't be too careful  detective   yes  i i've had alc     problems with alcohol in the past   i never tried to hide that   but  uh  you heard from my a a  sponsor   l i've been sober for over a year now  so     look  i i'm not disputing that    that it was my car     that hit mr  pryce   but     i reported it stolen hours before the accident   men like matt chambers  know how to pull on the invisible mask of sympathy   even empathy   and otherwise right thinking people don't stand a chance   i knew it    not guilty    matt chambers may have found a way to beat the system     but so have i   ricky  where the fuck are you   ohh  oh  fuck  he saw me   oh  please don't hurt me   the way we see it   you're in on the kill of ricky simmons   but that's not enough for you or for guerrero   ricky is dead   that saddens me   shut the fuck up   wait  you're not implying  that ricky simmons was a cop  are you   i'm truly disappointed   not only do i have a dead cop   someone broke in his house and shot his wife   word out in the world  sergeant     simmons's wife was fucking around   maybe he tried to kill the bitch himself  and felt so bad about it  he committed suicide   a cop murder suicide     it's a health crisis for you guys  ain't it   whoa  whoa   you think it's a fucking coincidence  your ass is in here    we got you on the causeway the morning ricky simmons died   bullshit   we don't deal in bullshit   we deal in good police work     and good science   you must have been a motherfucker at cat's cradle   i never played it   okay  kara simmons was shot while she was running   her phone call tells us that  right   she was running towards the back door    there   she turns   the shooter sees her  she's shot high on the chest   it spins her around   spraying blood on the walls there and there   she loses her cellphone   she struggles with the coffee table   the couch  and then she finally falls back    pop    there   she never got this far   it's not her blood   angel  meet our shooter   dna of cervantes' flesh in ricky simmons' mouth   dna from a rogue drop of blood we found at the simmons' house   tell me you're sure about this    that puts cervantes at both crime scenes   let's nail his coffin and ship it   whoa  hang on  sergeant   we get him to roll over on guerrero  and we own them both   you're talking about throwing him a deal   and then  what  he walks   if he does  we pick him up on other charges   if he gets us guerrero  it's win win   gets us guerrero   we can't catch the guy   he's un fucking touchable   come on  lieutenant   we already got a win   it's not about your win   it's about the big picture   i've seen this before   whenever a cop is killed   it's like everyone's life has been stopped in mid sentence   davey sanchez was a fearless and dedicated cop   davey sanchez was a son  a husband  and a father   davey sanchez was my partner   davey sanchez was my hero   that was great   what  dad   ever since davey was killed  my world feels out of control   how do you fix it   two ways  i guess     honor davey's memory        and catch the bastard who did this to him   it's not about vengeance   it's not about retaliation     or balancing the books   it's about something deep inside   my father had more than his share of pain   but he didn't deal with it the way most people do   happy hour    now  there's a misnomer   i'll have what he's having   wise choice   you celebrating   something like that   hey  have we met   i doubt it  i just moved down here   i needed a new start   girlfriend or boyfriend   ex wife   she said i drank too much   hence the  ex  part   fuck her   man  she was all over me to change   like she never done anything wrong in her life     besides marrying me   we all make mistakes   unfortunately  mine usually involve lawyers   god  damn it   i thought i was the only one who hated the hurricanes   i take it you didn't grow up in miami   no  i've had to move around some   say no more   but home is where my ass is   i'm getting mine out of town   enjoy miami   remember  there's nothing a new city can't cure   you got that right   hey  thanks  buddy   next one's on me   you sure you're good to drive   been a lot worse   i sure hope he doesn't go out there and kill himself   that would be    tragic   matt chambers is accused of committing a crime in florida   he was arrested in florida   and he's being tried in florida   so the good people of florida  only went as far as validating their own assumptions  that matt chambers is a florida bad guy    nothing a new city can't cure    my father taught me one thing above all others    to be sure   and i am   matt chambers  miami is your last stop   if god is in the details  and if i believed in god   then he's in this room with me   i just wish he'd brought an extension cord   hey   it's james   we're gonna get the bastard who did this to you   this guy is just toying with us   and laguerta's too fucking dumb to see it   deb was saying that this psycho guy  cut off that chick's fingertips   man  that's got to suck  right   guerrero taking home lobsters to boil alive     that's not his style   he usually leaves the killing to someone else   so  how long have you two been going out   a couple weeks  i guess   uh  deb never mentioned how you met   well  she brought her car into my shop  and     you have your own place   no  but i wish i did   someday  huh   dex  enough with the inquisition   no  it's all right   if i had a sister with legs like yours   i'd be checking out the dude she was seeing  too   is this guy a keeper or what   come on  i'll get you another drink   are you guys good   yep   seems like a nice guy   mm hmm   they could barely keep their hands off each other   i can kill a man  dismember his body   and be home in time for  letterman    but knowing what to say  when my girlfriend's feeling insecure     i'm totally lost   off your ass  cervantes  hands behind your back   walk backwards and assume the position   step away   exit the cell   where are we going   the call came down   they want you moved to a more secure block   you think the call to take care of me came down from the warden   who the fuck do you think the warden listens to   get used to it   that's from mr  guerrero     are you sleeping       are you sleeping       brother john      brother john      morning bells are ringing      morning bells are ringing      ding ding dong      ding ding dong    new claims for  u s  unemployment benefits  fell unexpectedly to 273 000 last week   pushing the 4 week average claim  to the lowest level in nearly 6 years   initial claims for state jobless aid  fell 11 000 in the week just ended   every time a woman tries to do this to me  it     tickles   still  it's not entirely unpleasant   what   the kids   oh  they sleep through thunderstorms   i'm sorry   tell me   l i can't do this   that's okay   that's okay   i'm okay   we have an elephant in the room  and its name is  sex    tell me about it   hey  as far as i'm concerned   it can just stay in the corner  and mind its own damn business   it's easier said than done   yeah   but it needs to be right     for both of us   or it won't be right for either of us   i don't want that  do you   no   you know     wow   i can't believe i found the one good  truly decent man  left on the planet      was found dead in a basement hallway  of the miami metro jail   norberto cervantes was a known associate  of reputed drug lord carlos guerrero   speculation is that another inmate  is responsible for the mayhem here tonight   notice how the skin is gloving around the joints   and that is important because   a sure sign of postmortem severance   meaning the victim was already dead when she was  relieved of her fingertips   why the different nail polishes   what the hell is this guy thinking   he's thinking   tag  dexter  you're it    i don't know  do you have an i d    shari taylor    another hooker   at least he's consistent  yeah   killing young women that have to sell their bodies  just to survive     or feed their kids   my sister puts up a front  so the world won't see how vulnerable she is   me  i put up a front  so the world won't see how vulnerable i'm not   i don't care who these fingertips belong to   only what my new friend out there is trying to say   morgan  the captain wants you   her   you wanted to see me  sir   lieutenant laguerta has something she wants to tell you   officer morgan  you've shown tremendous initiative  these last few days   because of you  we were able to track down that ice truck   and we now have an i d  on the latest victim   the captain believes you should be reassigned  from vice to homicide   and i concur  congratulations   you're a good cop  like your old man   thank you  sir   thank you so much   i see a detective shield in your future   i won't let you down  sir   i hope you know what you're doing   i promotedyou

i just got off the phone with the hospital   kara simmons suffered massive heart failure 30 minutes ago   i got to be there   james  she died   was cervantes right   was kara sleeping with someone other than ricky   was it you   what the fuck were you thinking    what the fuck business is it of yours    my cops  my precinct    my business   kara was gonna ask ricky for a divorce  as soon as he came off undercover   she didn't want to     she didn't want to hurt him when he was on the case   if i go by the book  i take you off the case   fuck the book   there's nobody more motivated to get     revenge   justice   take point on guerrero   thanks   in slaughterhouses   they stun the animals before butchering them   it's the humane thing to do   those animals    they're the lucky ones    brother  meet me at loco's crab shack   totally important  do not let me down  deb    gone to rest his weary head   the good news is  he'll still be here  when i come back for our own personal happy hour   mmm  god  these are so good   not as good as your good news   my little sister's all growed up and transferred to homicide   mmm   and the best part     laguerta had to say the actual words   i thought her head would explode   i'm really proud of you   you had my back the whole way  and i appreciate it   i mean that  you're the best   and that's why i wanted to share this moment with you   so  sean was busy   ah  it turns out there's another woman   who   me   sean the mechanic is married   imagine me picking the wrong guy  huh   and you and he are     so over   i dumped his married ass   i just wish i could get into a healthy relationship   like you and rita  without the drama  and the tension and the uncertainty   yeah  i'm a lucky guy   jesus  dad  it's called being on time   did you ever hear of it   i was having a bad day   the captain and i had a discussion   well  maybe you sh     wait  w what kind of bad day   it's about the guy who killed davey  isn't it   the judge said the bust wasn't righteous and let him walk   that guy kills a cop  and nothing happens   that's not fair   life's not fair  dexter   can't anyone do anything   can't you do something   no  not now   so what  then   the world just keeps spinning out of control   no   the world can always be set right again   that guy kills a cop  and nothing happens   not anymore   be back in a sec   i'm kind of running the gamut here emotion wise   nature calls   all the planning  the making sure     does it go away because i have a chance  to rid the world of a cop killer and balance the books   do i just ignore everything my father taught me  about how to do this right   about how to stay safe so i can do it again   yep   i don't give a shit about your goddamn problems   i gave you a job  you take care of it   what the fuck you looking at   happy birthday  alex   but next year at this time     it's you   and you   thanks  dad   all right  enough corniness   we meet again     aah      for the last time   i didn't do anyth    anything   some people believe that   the problem is  i don't   but it's true   i was    i was set up   by whom   that    that family   they needed someone to blame   it's a natural thing to do when you're grieving   so then none of this is your fault   i swear   okay  okay  okay  no   okay  okay  stop   all right   okay  okay   it    it was me  only it wasn't me   it was the booze   it takes me over   that's a point of view  to which i'm not entirely unsympathetic   neither you nor i  is in complete control of our destinies   although  at the moment   it would seem i have the upper hand   really  i'm so sorry   you've done this too many times to be sorry   carlos guerrero has chosen to live in a dangerous world   that's his truth   my truth is   that world
