me   try not to take any in the face   let's go  come on   who is that   him   i'm not sure who he is   why   he's in my english class   hey  way to catch with your face  mccall   unh   i don't know what it was   it was like i had all the time  in the world to catch the ball   and that's not the only weird thing   i can   hear stuff i shouldn't be able to hear   smell things   smell things  like what   like mint mojito gum in your pocket   i don't even have any mint mojito    so all this started with a bite   what if it's like an infection   like my body's flooding with adrenaline before  i go into shock or something   you know what   i actually think i've heard of this    it's a specific kind of infection   are you serious   yeah   yeah  i think it's called lycanthropy   what's that   is that bad   oh  yeah  it's the worst   but only once a month   once a month   mm hmm   on the night of the full moon   hey  you're the one who heard a wolf howling   hey  there could be something seriously wrong with me   i know  you're a werewolf   rrr   okay  obviously i'm kidding   but if you see me in shop class  trying to melt all the silver i can find   it's 'cause friday's a full moon   no  i i could have sworn this was it   i saw the body  the deer came running   i dropped my inhaler   maybe the killer moved the body   if he did  i hope he left my inhaler   those things are like 80 bucks   what are you doing here   huh   this is private property   uh  sorry  man  we didn't know   yeah  we were just looking for something  but     uh  forget it   all right  i gotta get to work   dude  that was derek hale   you remember  right   he's only like a few years older than us   remember what   his family   they all burned to death in a fire   like  ten years ago   i wonder what he's doing back   come on   hey  kitties   hi   i didn't see it   i took my eyes off the road for   like  two seconds to change the song on my ipod   and then this dog   it just came out of nowhere   it's all right  it's all right   it's all right   do you remember where it happened  so i can send animal control to find it   no  i mean  yes  i know where i hit it   but the dog is    where is it   it's in my car   you okay   she's just frightened   that makes two of us   let me see if i have any better luck   i think her leg is broken   i've seen the doctor do plenty of splints   i can do it myself and then give  her a painkiller for now   yeah  i have a shirt in my bag   oh  i don't want to trouble you   here   what   i didn't see anything   thanks for doing this   i feel really stupid   how come   i don't know   'cause i freaked out like a total girl   you are a girl   i freaked out like a girly girl   and i'm not a girly girl   what kind of girl are you   tougher than that   at least  i thought i was   hey  i'd be freaked out too   in fact  i'd probably cry   and not like a man  either   like the biggest girly girly ever   it'd be pathetic   yeah  right   so   it looks like she's gonna live   and i'm pretty sure she'll even let you pet her now   if you want   i don't think so   oh  come on   you don't want her to sue   i hear this breed is very litigious   you see   she likes you   what   i don't know  sorry   you have an eyelash on your cheek   oh  it's from the crying   thanks   yeah   so  um     i was wondering     i mean     is it really family night on friday   or do you think maybe you'd like to  go to that party with me   family night was a total lie   so is that a yes  you'll go   definitely yes   good morning   all right  little man   how 'bout you tell me where you're getting your juice   what   where are you getting your juice   my mom does all the grocery shopping   now  listen  mccall     you're gonna tell me exactly  what it is and who you're buying  it from  because there's no way  in hell you're out there kicking  ass on the field like that  without some sort of chemical boost   oh  you mean steroids   are you on steroids   what the hell is going on with you  mccall   what's going on with me   you really wanna know   well  so would i   because i can see  hear  and smell things  that i shouldn't be able to see  hear  and smell   i do things that should be impossible   i'm sleepwalking three miles into the middle of the woods   and i'm pretty much convinced that i'm totally out of my freaking mind   you think you're funny     don't you  mccall   i know you're hiding something   i'm gonna find out what it is   i don't care how long it takes   scott  scott  wait up   stiles  i'm playing the first  elimination  man   can it wait   just hold on  okay   i overheard my dad on the phone   the fiber analysis came back  from the lab in l a   they found animal hairs on the  body from the woods   stiles  i gotta go   wait  no  scott   you're not gonna believe what the animal was   it was a wolf   let's go  gather round   bring it in  come on   come on   got a question  mccall   what   you raised your hand   you have a question   oh   no  i was just  uh     nothing  sorry   okay  you know how this goes   if you don't make the cut   you're most likely sitting on  the bench for the rest of the season   you make the cut     you play   your parents are proud   your girlfriend loves ya   huh   everything else is  uh     cream cheese   now  get out there and show me  whatcha got   come on   let's go  let's go   uhh   mccall   get

still questioning  people  even derek hale   oh  the guy in the woods that  we saw the other day   yeah  yes   but that's not it  okay   what  then   remember the joke from the other day   not a joke anymore   the wolf  the bite in the woods   i started doing all this reading   do you even know why a wolf howls   should i   it's a signal  okay   when a wolf's alone  it howls  to signal its location to the rest of the pack   so if you heard a wolf howling   that means others could have been nearby   maybe even a whole pack of 'em   a whole pack of wolves   no   werewolves   are you seriously wasting my time with this   you know i'm picking up allison in an hour   i saw you on the field today  scott   okay  what you did wasn't just amazing  all right   it was impossible   yeah  so i made a good shot   no  you made an incredible shot  i mean     the way you moved  your speed  your reflexes   people can't just suddenly do that overnight   and there's the vision and the senses   and don't even think i don't notice that  you don't need your inhaler anymore   okay  dude  i can't think about this now   we'll talk tomorrow   tomorrow   what  no   the full moon's tonight   don't

trying to ruin it   i'm trying to help   you're cursed  scott   you know  and it's not just the  moon will cause you to physically change   it also just so happens to be  when your bloodlust will be at its peak   bloodlust   yeah  your urge to kill   i'm already starting to feel  an urge to kill  stiles   you gotta hear this    the change can be caused by  anger or anything that raises your pulse    all right   i haven't seen anyone raise your  pulse like allison does   you gotta cancel this date   i'm gonna call her right now   what are you doing   i'm canceling the date   no  give it to me

the party   she's  she's totally fine   no  i think i know who it is   you just let me in   we can try    it's derek   derek hale is the werewolf   he's the one that bit me   he's the one that killed the girl in the woods   scott   derek's the one who  drove allison from the party   scott   hi  mrs  argent   um   you have no idea who i am   i'm a friend of your daughter's   uh   look  this is gonna sound kind of crazy  um     really crazy  actually   you know what  crazy doesn't    allison   it's for you   where is she   she's safe   from you   raagh   what did you do with her   shh  quiet

me   is it really so bad  scott   that you can see better     hear more clearly  move faster  than any human could ever hope   you've been given something that  most people would kill for   the bite is a gift   i don't want it   you will   and you're gonna need me if you  want to learn how to control it   so you and me  scott     we're brothers now   you know what actually worries me the most   if you say allison  i'm gonna punch you in the head   she probably hates me now   ugh   i doubt that   but you might want to come up  with a pretty amazing apology   or  you know  you could just     tell her the truth and     revel in the awesomeness of the  fact that you're a frickin' werewolf   okay  bad idea   hey  we'll get through this   come on  if i have to  i'll  chain you up myself on full moon  nights and feed you live mice   i had a boa once  i could do it   so what happened   you left me stranded at the party   yeah  i  i know  i know   i'm really sorry  i am   but   you're gonna have to trust  that i had a really good reason   did you get sick   i definitely had an attack of something   am i gonna get an explanation   can you just find it in your  heart to trust me on
