  previously on veronica mars    i used to sit there   the only reason i was allowed past the velvet ropes was duncan kane     he used to be my boyfriend    i've got a secret  a good one   duncan  what happened  where's lilly   but you already know how this part of the story ends   the murder of lilly kane  and that bumbling local sheriff you heard about was my dad   your dad's tracking bail

 god fearing  salt of the earth types   every last one   you look great   yo  d     hey  who's your date  man    it's troy vandergraff   his father's the architect who built the county museum

s'mores   this is the good stuff     is this imported    this is a private party  man   oh  is it  i'm sorry  i must have been confused   hey  let me ask you something   have i ever asked you if i could come play through at torrey pines   have you ever run into me surfing down at cape crescent  bro   have you ever even once come home to find us throwing a kegger in your backyard   no  then what the hell do you think you're doing on our beach   am i supposed to apologize     am i supposed to shake in my boots    maybe   look around you  man  it ain't 15 on four tonight   hey  caitlin  you've been to my house a bunch  right     it's nice  right  it's clean  well kept    very   do you wanna know why   it's because weevil's grandma keeps it that way   she is a good little worker  your grandma  spic and span   it's a tough job  you know  grandma says you go through a box of tissue a day   your room alone   what can i say to that  you know  she's a very sexy lady  thank you   this is the sheriff's department  i want your ids out     go  go  go    and everyone remain where you are   are we gonna go after them   no  let's get out  get the kegs   tell the guys  cookout at my place tomorrow night     hey  hey    stay right there   move your ass  little man  come on  i'm losing     sheriff's department  open up    what did you boys do   don't worry about it  grandma  we'll handle it  all right   guess you busted all those rich kids already  huh   boys   leticia navarro  i got a warrant for your arrest     come with us    what's your problem     if you want me  be a man about it    what are the charges   credit card fraud   credit    she doesn't even have any credit cards  man   not in her own name  no   but somebody took credit card offers out of the echolls' family trash   they opened up accounts  they rang up charges   you heard anything about that   no  i didn't think so   because it would take a major league loser        to let a sweet old lady like that do his time for him    get them inside  man   listen to this list of charges to the card   half dozen video games  limo rides  magic mountain tickets  motorcycle gear   it goes on like that  i sincerely doubt my client  mrs  navarro        suddenly decides to steal from the echolls after 10 years of loyal service        just so she can get herself a new piercing from puddy tats   it's gotta be the kid  eli navarro     what do they call him    weevil   oh  clearly  it's weevil  lamb doesn't even believe it's mrs  navarro        but the p o  box where the merchandise was sent is in her name   plus  she was wearing a diamond pendant purchased with one of the phony cards   lamb could've set weevil up  he hates him  you know     i started picking up eli when he was 12    he just helped me out of a jam recently   look  i'm sure he's a real mensch  but i've got a grandma in jail        and i'd really like to get her out    we'll dive in  thanks  cliff   honey        he goes to your school  you mind taking point on this for a few days     i'm working on something    i'll see what i can find   the trouble with befriending the leader of a motorcycle gang        is that at the end of the day  he's still the leader of a gang   i'd like to believe differently  but i doubt it's his grandmother who's buying video games        and paying for new motorcycle paint jobs   i've hospitalized people for less than what you're doing right now   what  admiring your paint job   i know what you're doing  and admiring my paint job isn't it   i'm following up on things for the lawyer who's representing your grandma   yeah  i met the guy  he says i should confess   you think you will     i got nothing to say to you  man    weevil  your grandma's in jail   oh  are you reminding me  because i almost forgot   i'm just saying  with your reputation  you can't blame mccormack for thinking     my reputation  well  then i guess what everybody says about you is true too  huh   that you like it a little freaky  don't you   that you spy on duncan kane  that you send him pictures of yourself   be honest  veronica  you think you're this big outsider        but push comes to shove  you're still one of them   you still think like one of them  take off   i don't want you around here   are you gonna wear that cap inside  at the table   do you think i'm offending someone   in here   simple etiquette  that's all   well  look who's here   ah  if it isn't my predecessor and mentor  how's the dirty picture biz  boss   it looks like it's better than being sheriff  actually   you got a killer on the loose  lamb    in a daring daylight escape  ray lee hempstead        denied bail earlier this week after his arrest for manslaughter        broke out the back windshield of a balboa county sheriff's department cruiser        and fled on foot      meeks and johnson lost him     i think those are two guys you hired    you hear that  that's leadership   way to stand up on your own two feet  lamb  and say   hey  the buck stops there     you know what's coming up  october 3rd   are you doing anything special to mark the one year anniversary        of lilly kane's murder  i got it   dress like a sheriff and crucify some poor  grieving father  for old time's sake   tell me again how you solved the crime of the century   wait a minute  i remember   an anonymous tip leads you to the supposed killer's houseboat   did anybody show up to collect the   100 000 reward for that information     do you find that strange    no  what about your theory   jake kane murders his own daughter   we've got a witness and phone records that have him nowhere near the house   all the kanes  in fact  were accounted for at the time of the murder   what's that  nothing to say to that  right     sacks  we got our order ready    good luck with that fugitive  don   smell you later    smell you later    i gotta run  the counselor wants to see me before class   about what   my schedule and my attitude  not necessarily in that order  her words     give us a smile  love    troy vandergraff     what are you doing in here    oh  hey   i signed up for diving  but there were only four people in the class   so they cancelled it  stuck me in here   so don't you mess with me  i'm an office aide     that's great    yeah  for who   for me   copy all of weevil's attendance records from this past month        and get them to me   do i look like james bond to you   am i asking you to retrieve a nuclear warhead  no   just copy the attendance records  it's cake   why don't you try moving the caption down  see how it looks     can i help you with something    the counselor stuck me in here   she says i'm disconnected and passionless   ms  dent     caitlin    i'm going to the gym        to talk to people for the student poll    be back by the end of the period   remember that we're a multi cultural school with a diverse population of students        from a wide range of socio economic backgrounds     meaning    meaning don't just interview your friends   so  veronica  welcome to newspaper class   i was thinking maybe i could just take pictures   i'm not sure if you could just do that  but we can start there     do you have any experience with a camera    yeah  some   this is a 35 mm camera   now  my suggestion  as you're starting out  is to set it on auto     i'd really be more comfortable if i could just use my own camera   the swivel lcd comes in handy when you're doing overhead shooting        or ground level macro shooting   the optical zoom actually goes up to 71 2 mm   it's good to have the raw file option to mess with the images post exposure        without nearly the loss of image quality you'd get with a jpeg file   and when it's dark outside  you should use a flash   i have your first assignment  are you free tomorrow     i guess    we're doing a feature on bodie chang     you know him    surfer  i was in study hall with him   that's him  he's winning all these competitions   he's got another one at gold coast  meet the guy who's doing the story   duncan kane  this is veronica   veronica is taking pictures tomorrow  you'll ride with bodie's parents     i'll drive    great  maybe veronica can     i can drive too   okay  oil crisis be damned   look at this   half of these credit card purchases are online orders        and the ones made on school days were made between 11 a  m  and 12 p  m   that's fourth period   yeah  you realize  don't you  that this guy you're trying to help out        duct taped me buck naked to a flagpole just last week   man  you really hold a grudge   yeah  i'm funny that way   and you're welcome for those records   wallace  king kong ain't got nothing on you     hell  no    but think about this   how can a guy who  according to records        was in auto shop seven of the eight days these purchases were made        manage to make online orders   aren't you supposed to prove he did it so you can get his grandma out of jail   but it's impossible  there's no internet connection in auto shop     it can't be hard for him to slip out of there    seven times   yeah  but his arraignment isn't until monday   i don't think he did it     who didn't do what    weevil   i was looking through the attendance records        and i just don't think it's possible    veronica     cliff just got back from the courthouse    they released letty navarro hours ago     that's great    they released her        because eli  weevil  navarro came in and confessed to the crime   how difficult is it to find good help these days     what will you do about your housekeeper    we had to let her go   if you can't trust your domestics  you don't feel safe in your own home   i won't miss her  she was totally rude to me every time i was there   did you know that 90 percent of all identity theft        is committed by relatives of the victim  that's an interesting fact     at least i think so    but you know what   no one cares what you think  veronica mars  not anymore   not since you stabbed your friends in the back     you seem to care a bit what i think    tell the truth   did you just sign up for newspaper so you could be around duncan   no  i'm here so i can be closer to you   they're thinking of putting me in your fourth period government class     we've got computer lab fourth period    oh  shoot   my loss   what you got there  v   i printed out the entire browser history from logan's computer        in his fourth period computer lab class    so is he guilty   well  of wanting desperately to see pictures of alyssa milano naked  yes   but of making bogus credit card charges  i don't think so   wait  the neptune grand   logan visited the neptune grand hotel website   he didn't make reservations online  but     but there's a charge on the credit card for the honeymoon suite   bummer     flat    just as god made me     are you always this persnickety    sometimes i'm even persnicketier   i'm supposed to be taking surf competition photos in gold coast        in 30 minutes  and this is my second mysterious flat since school started   well  here  let me help you     i'm troy  by the way    i'm veronica   really  veronica   okay  yeah  that does make a lot more sense     makes more sense how    it's nothing   i just    i should never listen to those guys   really  who names their daughter trampy mcbitch     hey    hey  nice ride     what's up    not much  how are you doing     good    with two miles on it     it's new    tooling around school a little   what's troy doing talking to veronica     what do you care    i don't  it just     has anyone told him   hey  veronica  you need a ride  if we don't go now  we'll miss it   go  i'll finish this  throw the tools in the trunk   chivalry not dead  good to know  i'm right over here   i should've walked to gold coast   it's only 30 miles  but with the awkward silence  it feels like 300   in five seconds  i'm gonna do the charlie's angels roll right out of the moving car   five  four  three     lilly loved this song   yeah     why'd you join pep squad  veronica    the p e  credit     you    veronica  i suffer from too much pep   i needed a pep outlet   plus  sassy says girls who join the clubs really get the fellas   because you really need a lot of help on that front   well  you know what my mom says   you have to kiss a few toads   that's it  that's her entire philosophy   all your mother says to me is   veronica  shouldn't you be getting home soon    that sounds like her     why does she hate me    well  it's not your fault   she'd hate anyone she thought that duncan might love as much as her   friendly advice   watch her   she'll break the two of you up if she can   slow down   wonderful   license and registration   can i have the two of you step out of the car     is there a problem    i've got an impound notice on this vehicle   bunch of parking tickets and a moving violation dated october 3rd   they wanna impound the car   i guess there are a bunch of tickets   no  not mine   lilly's   just outside of town on the pch  about a mile from the real inn   it's a long story   i'll tell you when you get here   pull around the front     you ready to go    yeah  i've already got it in neutral   officer   officer  have you called this in to the sheriff   no  sir  we generally don't call in routine traffic violations   all right  well  why don't you give him a shout   duncan  did you get everything out of        hello  veronica    mr  kane   the last time my dad and jake kane were in the same place at the same time        was in a sheriff's department interrogation room   i told you that i was at work     when jake finished his story  dad told the most powerful man in town        that he was sure he was somehow involved in his own daughter's death   jake went to the press  the adoring press  tears in his eyes        and told the world how much he missed his baby        and how he was wrongfully accused   the fine people of neptune gathered their pitchforks and torches        stormed the county commissioner's office  and ran dad out of office   my friends got on the bandwagon as well  they gave me a choice   i could stand by my dad or stand by duncan and my dead best friend's family   i chose dad   it's a decision i live with every day   and you wanna know the kicker  i don't even know what's true anymore   maybe everyone else is right  maybe dad screwed up the investigation   maybe i gave up my circle of friends  my life  over an error in dad's judgment   hold on   we're not gonna move the car   i'm so sorry  mr  kane  i had no idea   thank you   so   what's up   you and duncan starting to hang out again   i'll tell you the details of my personal life if you tell me why you went after jake        when to everyone  he was a heartbroken father     honey  are you and duncan star       no   it's a school assignment  that's all   can

she asks you to take out a bag of trash   there they are in front of you  virgin  high  limit  pre approved credit card applications   phone in the confirmation code and start spending   then you use logan echolls' family credit cards to take out caitlin ford        in the manner to which she's accustomed   gourmet meals  five star hotels  limo rides   but the best part about it        is that your cousin weevil takes the fall for you     so you're promoted    i didn't want that to happen   weevil's like my brother   your brother is out picking up trash on the highway   you know what  it's killing me  okay  but you see  i got a plan     i'm all ears    caitlin and me  we're gonna run away   we are  and once we're gone        i'll write a confession  i'll send it back        they gotta

turn yourself in    i ain't going nowhere without her   caitlin and me        we love each other   so tell me why every time i see her  logan echolls has his hands all over her   i don't understand why you're doing it  you know chardo gave you that pendant        but you're letting weevil do the time for him   eli is still 17  chardo is 18  and he's got a record   they'd send him to prison  weevil can do four months of juvie   weevil thinks he's taking the fall for you   i have dinner to fix  okay   do you know what he was doing with those credit cards   he spent all that money  thousands of dollars        taking out a spoiled  rich white girl  logan echolls' girlfriend   you must have met her  caitlin ford   no  not her   she doesn't like her ice cubes made with tap water   you lost your job        and now weevil's doing time so that chardo can take this girl out in style   let me see those receipts   oh  it's so good to have you home   veronica mars  i hear you're to

existence   i think if i knew more about the case and the evidence     honey  it's ugly   i want thoughts of lilly's death out of your head     i don't wanna pour more into it    i can handle it   just look at it this way   if i knew what would happen to us     your mom would leave  that school would get tough for you     i never would've pursued jake kane the way i did     i still wanna know    i know you do   let's go home   a couple weeks before lilly was murdered and dad was still sheriff        she and i snuck into the back room and made fake ids        so we could get into clubs  i had them sent to my house   they arrived days after her body was discovered   i stuck them in a drawer and forgot        until the deputy mentioned lilly's october 3rd ticket   the good thing about visiting sheriff's department on a sunday        is that the people who work on weekends don't remember me  they're new   is there something i can help you with   the insurance company called my dad and said we have an outstanding ticket     there's the license number    okay  and can i see your id   what are you doing here   just paying off a ticket   hey  any luck finding chardo navarro   no  you should talk to my dad  he's really good at that sort of thing   you got a smart mouth  kid   i don't think there's wiggle room on this one     thanks  i'll mail in the payment    all right  miss kane   sorry about the bad news   i haven't gone more than 30 minutes without glancing at the ticket   one of those automated intersection cameras caught lilly running a red light        at 6 02 p  m   almost two hours after her supposed time of death   i don't know if it's the photo of lilly        singing and smiling on the final day of her life that's been haunting me        or the fact that  suddenly  none of the kanes have alibis that hold up   jake  celeste  even duncan   dad was right  the case doesn't add up   i made a choice a long time ago   stand by dad or stand by the people tearing him down   you didn't make it saturday night   i guess i didn't feel i was even a little bit wrong or sorry   well  a wise man once said that a  no  is like a  yes         except with different letters arranged in a different order   but  you know  it disappears on the wind   there goes the neighborhood   they just put golden tee in the sac n pac  we need to go  i can get you free games   hey  guys  look     hate to be her    yeah  that would suck   i've never played golden tee  but i'm pretty sure i can kick both your asses     lead the way    i'm just saying     ready to lose    i think we got a competition going on
