jessa  i'm    what you're going through is  like  really  really hard  for any young woman  and it totally makes sense  that you would wanna escape through drug use   but you have to know that you're not just my cousin   you're my friend   and i could not be more proud of you for getting this abortion   thanks  shoshanna   okay  i think i got everything     testicles  spectacles  wallet  watch     'kay  bye   did i leave anything in there with you   no   where are you headed   um  don't you remember   i'm a dirty little whore going home to my parents covered in cum     your cum    what   that was a joke about the thing you said last night when we were having sex   about how you were gonna send me home to my parents covered in cum   i  um   i'm just going home to get my cell phone charger   and then i'm going to a job interview  and then  um     i'm actually accompanying a friend to her abortion   so that's what i'm doing   shit   that's kind of a heavy fucking situation   is it really  i feel like people say that it's a huge deal   but how big a deal are these things actually     i don't know    right  yeah  it's just an abortion     that's silly    no  i'm not saying that   i just mean  what was she gonna do   have a baby and take it to her babysitting job     it's not realistic    no shit  fucker   i never thought of it that way  but it's a good point   mean  i guess i don't really know   because this is the first abortion i've ever been to   no  you don't say   i really hope you didn't find that flippant   because i did not mean that abortions aren't a big deal   i just meant that i have very little sympathy for people who do not use condoms   because that is how you get pregnant and that is how you get diseases   well  i don't know what it is about me   but girls never ask me to use condoms     girls never asked you to use condoms    no   i do what i'm told     we always use condoms    do we   yeah  we used one last night   oh  yeah  i guess we do   that's probably why it takes me 25 years to nut  whenever i have sex with you   hey   oh  you're totally freaking out right now   you have total freak out face     i'm not freaking out right now    yes  you are   how would you even know what i look like freaking out     you've never seen me freak out    it's okay   i'm totally fine  okay   and you're totally pretty     okay    stop trying to kiss me  stop trying to kiss me   stop trying to kiss   okay  i'll see you later   if you tell me what i am doing   then i will immediately stop doing it   that's the point   you shouldn't  stop doing something just because i tell you to   you should be able to just be yourself   but it seems like myself is making you very frustrated   who cares  charlie  you should just be able to go about your business   piss me off  and not give a fuck   that's what men do   it's like i don't even know how to m    make love to you anymore   make love to me  you mean  fuck me   it's like you want me to be like some dude who just doesn't give a shit   like   oh  fucking suck it    and then fucking lay down and take a nap    ew    you want these fucking nuts in your mouth    no  i don't want to suck on your nuts     oh  come on  really    no   have you seen your nuts     ew    like  i know you're joking   but that's not funny to be like   ew    ew   i never get used to those stairs   we'll talk about it later  have a great day  ladies   oh  i mean  sluts   you're a slut   what     i'm sorry about him    no sweat off my back     what's going on    oh  my god   i mean  he's so busy respecting me  you know   that he looks right past me  and everything that i need from him   okay  you are a 23 year old girl  who's had the same boyfriend for four years   so you're also allowed to be bored   that's an okay excuse  too   that is a really simplistic explanation for what's going on   i'm sorry if i minimized it   i'm just unwilling to accept the idea  that you have too great a boyfriend   although  if you want someone to feed you abusive rhetoric   just send him to adam's house for the night     he'll learn a lot    oh  more hooker stuff   hooker stuff  daddy st    a combin   a platter of stuff   hannah  adam cannot do that to you   he can't  he's not allowed  he's not your boyfriend    hello  kwartler gallery  this is marnie speaking     hi    hey  'sup   oh  nothing  actually  i was just wondering if maybe    no big deal  but you could get me an appointment for this afternoon  too     why    oh  you know  for an std test   i mean  since we're gonna be there anyway   and it's like  i'm gonna be there  you're gonna be there   maybe we both get them  maybe we all get them   no  thank you  though   well  when's the last time you did that   well  charlie's been tested twice since we've been together     so i figure that's     not the same thing   i've only had sex with two and a half men   and i'm gonna start doing it every few months  i think  just to be responsible   you were just bragging to me  about how you always use condoms   julian  stop listening   i mean  if that's true  then don't you think  you probably don't have anything   yeah  but what about the stuff that gets up around the sides of condoms  okay   what about that stuff  have you thought about that stuff   okay  crazy one  i'll schedule you an appointment   so this guy's making you bananas   i've never experienced anything like it   the thing is i have absolutely no sense of how he really feels about me  because when we are together   he's so there and he's so present   and then he disappears for two weeks  and doesn't answer any text messages   and i feel as though i invented him   did you invent him   if i'd invented him  then i wouldn't have a giant bruise on my ass   pause   i have something to contribute here    listen  ladies   a tough love approach to the tough game of love      mm hmm    okay  i'm gonna admit that i have hate read that book   oh  my god   it  like  totally changes your perspective  right   okay   if a man doesn't take you on a date    he's not interested  point blank   'let's meet up with friends' is not a date   it's a date for him to decide whether you're truly good enough to date   and that's unacceptable  ladies    there have to be exceptions to that rule    sex from behind and that is degrading  able  point blank   you deserve someone who wants to look in your beautiful face  ladies    what if i want to focus on something else   what if i want to feel like i have udders   this woman doesn't care about what i want   but here's my question  who are  the ladies    obvi   we're the ladies   i'm not the ladies   yeah  you're the ladies   i'm not the ladies   yes  you are  you're the ladies   you're being unfair  you can't force me to be a lady   i'm not forcing you to be a lady   you just   okay  i'm a lady   she's a lady  you're a lady   we're the ladies   fuck that silly little fucking book   i told you  i just read it  in a weird moment of desperation at the detroit airport   how could you even finish a book like that   that book is so idiotic  i couldn't even read it on a toilet   it might be pink and cheesy   but there's actually some very real wisdom in there  about how to deal with men and    that woman is a horrible lady   why is this bothering you so much   i'm offended by all the supposed tos   i don't like women telling other women  what to do or how to do it or when to do it   every time i have sex  it's my choice   yeah and if i wanted to go on some dates  i would   but i don't  because they're for lesbians   are you okay   what is wrong   i mean  i know what is wrong  but how is it wrong     are you scared    no     are you angry    who would i be angry at     maybe you're a little angry at yourself    no     so are you angry at me    you are so self involved     are you sad    i am not a character for one of your novels   stop staring at my face so hard   fine  ok   and also  i write essays   you know  i want to have children   i really wanna have children   yeah  of course  you do   and you will have children at a time when your life is actually set up    i'm gonna be amazing at it  i'm gonna be really good   i know that you are   i've never doubted that for a second   and i wanna have children with many different men of different races   so  i have this job interview  and i'm gonna meet you there at 1 00     i love you  okay    that's okay   this   you know   i mean  the truth is it's pretty boring  and we're just like a trade journal   no  my god  i mean  i would be so excited to work here   and i'm also  i should say  responsible  decisive   and all the other qualities you're weirdly allowed to name in a job interview   yeah  i think the only other place  that you're allowed to brag like that  is on your online dating profile     not that i have one    oh  no  of course not   so   so you live in brooklyn   is it williamsburg     no  i live in greenpoint    oh     you know  big difference  williamsburg and greenpoint    oh  sure  yeah     are you in brooklyn or       yeah  cobble hill   oh  that's like grown up brooklyn   yeah  i'm like a real live grown up   can't you tell   so  in your neighborhood  do you ever drink at that place weather up   that's a little bit hip for my taste   are you kidding  you're very hip   but i do object to any bar that calls its bartenders  mixologists      exactly    and they wear tiny vests     i know    if i'm gonna drink in your neighborhood     then i wanna go to washington commons    washington commons     oh  my god  i love that place    hands down   i like a bar where the median age is about 55   i like a bar where the average patron would be described as  crotchety      crotchety's good    crotchety's great     crotchety's undervalued     it's true   in our modern society  crotchety is undervalued   so  i should probably look at your resume as a formality     i'm totally fine if you don't  too    yeah   and so   yeah  this is great     this is really     where did you go to school   oh  i just went   i went to syracuse  upstate     i have so many friends who went there    yeah  me  too   because you went there with them   yeah  a few of them up there   i read a statistic that said syracuse  has the highest incidents of date rape of any university   wow   which weirdly went way down  the year that you graduate  that was just a joke  because i was saying  that there was no more date rape   because they figured out who it was  who was doing it  and it was you   maybe you're not used to office environments like this   but  um  jokes about rape or race  or incest or any of that kind of stuff   it's not office okay   and so  i just don't think this is gonna work out  right now  but call us back   maybe six months  eight months down the road   and we'll stay in touch       i want to spend my life          with a girl like you          ba ba ba ba ba  ba ba ba ba          and do all the things          that you want me to          ba ba ba ba ba  ba ba ba ba          till that time has come         what can i get you   what time is it   it's 1 00   these things never start on time     i'll have a white russian  please    all right   i am really sorry  okay     i'm sorry    you are 10 minutes late     i'm eight minutes late    you're 10 minutes late     okay  well  where's jessa    well  she's not here   because she's never fucking here when she needs to be     sorry    well  she was really upset before   i think you should be a little bit sensitive   i mean  you think  she's about to get an abortion   it's about the most traumatic thing that can ever happen to a woman   i'm telling you  i don't know why you're being so casual about this   i was getting really  really worked up on the train on the way here   you don't need to worry about her  okay  this office is beautiful     i'm sure they've done this a million times before    i was just thinking    i have been sexually irresponsible enough in my life thus far  that i should've gotten pregnant by now  and i never have   like  i get my period at the same time   on the same day of every monthly cycle my entire life   like  it's never strayed from that   then you're really lucky   i never know when i'm gonna get my period  and it's always a surprise   and that's why all my underwear are covered in weird stains   seriously  i need to become a mom  hannah   i was put on this planet to be a mother   well  maybe charlie has a really low sperm count   i'm sure charlie has a really low sperm count   what if i'm barren     no  you're not barren    hi  hi   i'm so sorry i'm late   i stopped at dylan's and got some snacks  because i don't know how long these things take   when my sister had a baby  it was like hours   and i was like starving  so  you know  i was just    shoshanna  you should sit down   so you know venice is sinking   so i'm like   we gotta get out of here  we gotta move    this place is going down  it's happening faster than you think    nobody fucking moves   i was like   are you guys crazy     hey  do you guys have a pay phone   why would we have a pay phone   here  you can use my cellular phone   oh  thank you     you have a bunch of texts and stuff    mind your own business   hey  mom  it's morgan   st calling to let you know  i will call you back in a few hours  and i hope you're feeling better   love you  bye     thank you    sure   what's that you're drinking   milk   jessa  it's marnie   it is 1 30  and your appointment was at 1 00   so call me  please  bye   hey  a little bird told me  that you were getting an s t d  test  fun   do you really think that sounds like a lot of fun   i mean  like  just to get to have sex  and then have a test about it   this thing asks you if you wear a seat belt and if you operate machinery   those are important things if you're gonna have a baby   you need to wear a seat belt and stop operating machinery   she's obsessed with getting aids   she thought she was gonna have it since she was 10 years old   so that's what this is about   i don't have an obsessive fear of aids   i have an obsessive fear of h i v  that turns into aids     i'm not a fool    well  you don't have h i v   you just don't  it's not that easy to contract   it's really not that hard to contract either  though     haven't you seen  rent     please  i've seen it 12 times   it's basically why i moved to new york   so use condoms if you're so scared   i do use condoms  i always use condoms   but what about all the stuff that gets up around the sides of condoms   what about that stuff   like what  what kind of stuff   okay  so when a guy finishes  there's    the material  okay     right    and then  that stuff  can leak out from around the sides of condoms   and here's how i figure it   he will leave his penis in you  from when it's hard to when it shrinks   because that is what guys are wont to do   are they really wont to do that   yeah  like  with me   with me they're totally wont to do that   yeah  they usually do that   and then  when they pull out  it's fucking mayhem   i've been diagramming it in my head all afternoon   and then  and no one speaks about this     hannah horvath    okay  that is me   please  don't yell at jessa too much when she gets here  okay   i won't  i won't  i mean  it's just    it's a bummer because  like  she ruined it  but it's not    how could she ruin the beautiful abortion that you threw   hannah  that is not what i meant   you're a really good friend   and you threw a really good abortion     oh  stop it    you did   i'm just worried  you know   what if she's in a gutter or changed her mind   she seemed really excited about it this morning   whoa  this is wild   put your hands down my pants     now    yes   okay   like that     is that okay    don't ask me that ever again in my life   sorry   um     you're bleeding   oh  my god   oh  shit   jess star  it's shosh   it's   it's like 2 15  and i'm just calling to see  where you are and how you're feeling and  um  if you're   oh   uh  hey  you're pregnant when you don't wanna be   so you might wanna come have your abortion now   okay  thanks  bye   there is seriously nothing flakier in this world  than not showing up to your own abortion   i mean  honestly  can you think of anything less respectful than that   other than getting pregnant in the first place   seriously  she should just fucking  you know   return our calls or something  or at least send us a text   she doesn't really know how to text   she calls it a  word alert    i don't even know why i bother anymore   honestly  every time i put myself out there with her    nothing  just brick wall   she does not respect my time  my efforts   my friendship  my kindness   none of it   i mean  would you do this   would you get pregnant after having sex with some weird foreigner  and then just not even show up to the abortion   i've never had sex   what   i've never had sex  okay   a k a   i'm almost 22 and i'm a virgin   really     seriously    okay   it's like everyone and their mother has had sex except for me   no  sex is   sex is really  really overrated   what   it is   i mean  you've given a blow job  right     yes    yeah  so      no    really   yes  i have not     you haven't    there was this one time at camp   and it was a few strokes up and down   but we were in the woods and it was kind of spooky  so     you think i'm a loser   i don't   i don't think you're a loser   i just told you that i'm a virgin     i don't     i don't know what to say   i mean  i hit   i hit a puppy once with my car   i only had my learner's permit     24 years old  mm hmm     145 pounds    oh  i'm 143 pounds   the nurse weighed me with clothes on   so that was a rude thing to do   sexually active     just one partner or       should i get more   because the one i've got is kind of a handful   yeah  it's just him   and do you use protection  condoms   i always use condoms  but i've been thinking a lot lately  about the stuff that gets up around the sides of condoms   what is the deal with all of that stuff  you know   you mean    the semen   i mean  all of it   i have a very bad fear of aids   have you known someone with aids   it's more of like a  forrest gump  based fear   that's what robin wright penn's character died of   okay  just lie back for me  okay   yeah  just       yes  legs up    mm hmm   yeah  oh  okay   perfect  thank you   the thing is that these days if you are diagnosed with aids   you know  it's actually   it's not a death sentence   there's so many good drugs and people live a long time   also  you know  if you have aids   there's a lot of stuff people aren't gonna bother you about   like  for example  no one's gonna call you on the phone and say    did you get a job   or  did you pay your rent     or  are you taking an html course     because all they're gonna say is  like    congratulations on not being dead    and it's also a really good excuse to be mad at a guy   it's not just something dumb like   you didn't text me    it's like   you gave me aids    so deal with that    forever    maybe i actually am not scared of aids   maybe i thought i was scared of aids   and what i really am is wanting aids   that is an incredibly silly thing to say   you do not want aids   do you know that every 35 minutes  a woman is newly diagnosed with h i v    and a third of those women are under the age of 30   and many of them will die of aids   so  you're saying that if adam gave me aids   that i'm definitely going to die of it   no  i'm not saying that   can you op up  please   you could not pay me enough to be 24 again   well  they're not paying me at all     ow    is that
