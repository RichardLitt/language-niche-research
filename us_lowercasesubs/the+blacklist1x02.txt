   1         please allow me to introduce myself          i'm a man of wealth and taste          i've been around for a long  long year          stole many a man's soul and faith            and i was 'round when jesus christ          had his moment of doubt and pain        you ready        made damn sure that pilate       washed his hands and sealed his fate      well  now  that's a stupid question       ooh        pleased to meet you      hope you guess my name      oh  yeah      oh  what's puzzling you is the nature of my game          oh  yeah  monday  9 07 a m  examiner hatch   subject    elizabeth scott keen   here we go   before monday of last week   did you have  or have you ever had     personal contact with raymond reddington    no   did reddington notify you  before he surrendered himself to the fbi   no   have you ever been convicted of a crime   convicted  not yet   please answer  yes  or  no    have you ever been convicted of a crime   you're wasting valuable time   does elizabeth keen know why you surrendered yourself   he's telling our people he wants immunity   that he's willing to cooperate  give us names     what names    he's got a list   alleges he can deliver us high value criminal targets  if the justice department grants him immunity   what's his legal status   the man sold secrets to the hofstad network  to the syrians   he's not getting immunity   talk to me about containment   who knows we've got him   including us in this room    a total of 26 people   remember  he's been off the grid for over 20 years   yet he seems to know things even you don't   about this  uh  elizabeth keen     says her father has some kind of criminal record     yes    polygrapher  before monday of last week   did you have  or have you ever had   personal contact with elizabeth keen   no   he's lying   polygrapher  does raymond reddington know   or has he ever known  your husband   his name's tom keen  schoolteacher  4th grade   he's currently in a medically induced coma   was nearly killed last week during an altercation  on a case keen was working  he gonna survive   the situation is uncertain   you're confident that the husband's  not involved with reddington   no   the truth is we don't have any idea  who reddington may be involved with   fowler  then why should we trust him   you're asking the wrong questions   i'm trying to help you with a matter of some urgency   it's your choice whether you listen to me or not   but there will be an incident at 11 00 this morning  at the decatur industrial park   i would send ambulances   cooper  we need to move quickly   woman  he's a prisoner   he has no legal position to negotiate from   charge him under the patriot act   see what he has to say then  he'll only speak with keen   it's not up to him  we decide who he speaks     i don't think you understand how delicately  the situation needs to be handled   reddington has brokered some of the most comprehensive  international criminal activity in the past 20 years   he has access to targets we don't even know exist   now  he's telling us there may be some kind of an event  about to happen at the decatur industrial park   fowler  i don't think you understand   you don't run the criminal division of main justice  i do   the attorney general is not going to accept a deal   reddington is a criminal   and we're gonna take credit for catching him   our office will lay out the charges   i hope you understand that from time t     there is    no    deal   am i clear   yes   polygrapher  and have you been truthful  to the best of your knowledge   so  what do we got   swept the entire yard   got multiple teams working the property  k 9 units   nothing  i mean  look around   i got two city blocks of hiding places   and i don't even know what the hell  i'm supposed to be looking for   i need more information  what's the specific tip   who did it come from   we got an informant who's dicking us around   says we're gonna need rescue units here at 11 00   it's already 11 20   give it another 20 minutes and wrap it up   i want bomb squads  medics  i want everybody out   man  we've got a problem   a passenger train just blew through   come again  what was that   i said you have a passenger train  coming in your direction   it's over speed   clear the area  get everyone out       clear  clear out   get your men out of here  clear   sync and correction by geirdm      those things i found under the floor   they're not yours  right   he put them there     the gun and the passports   tell me reddington did this  and not     i wish you were here so you could explain yourself    have been confirmed dead  and dozens injured after a passenger train derailed  this morning at the decatur industrial park   because of you    because you don't return my calls  harold   if you want to save lives and catch the bad guys   pay attention   they're not going to make your deal  that's unfortunate   the next name on my list is an absolute snake   the train  how did you know   i know lots of things  but the train i didn't   i knew the time  the place   but the train was a big surprise   we've ruled out terrorism   look at the list of casualties  harold   you'll find some councilwoman from albany   apparently she's been tangling  with some rather cunning  powerful people   you're saying the derailment was an assassination   i'm not saying anything     unless it's to elizabeth keen         tell me about the train wreck     if you had any idea how far i've traveled  to see you again  lizzy   my name's  liz   not  lizzy   to you  i'm agent keen   now  i've heard all your demands   but i don't think you've heard mine   so let me tell you how this is gonna work   i ask the questions  you answer them   screw with me  and i walk   understood   how is tom   they're never gonna give you immunity   not a chance   oh  i think they will   otherwise  what am i doing here   i'm perfectly happy to go back to the boat   tell me about the train wreck   what would you like to know   everything   the train accident was no accident  you know that   but what you don't know is the man behind it     is quite prolific   he's responsible for a slew of other premeditated killings  just like this one  disguised as accidents   shall i go on   raymond  a building collapses in moscow   a ferry capsizes on the brahmaputra river   these are the events we've come to expect on the evening news   but in truth  there's always more to the story   hidden between the facts and figures   the victims and the heroes  there's always a murder   the work of a man who disguises his killings  in the headlines of everyday tragedies   what proof do you have   his work is difficult to detect  but the victims are there   an appellate court judge in ohio   a french diplomat who dies in a plane crash   look closer  the pattern will emerge   over the last seven years   more than 3 000 innocent civilians have died   all collateral victims  as a result of this man's unique methods   in the 20 odd years i've been working my side of the tracks   i have not encountered another contractor  who's had as significant an impact  on the civilian population as he   he's rivaled only by governments and terrorist organizations   and you've never heard of him   i have it on good authority  that his next contract will take him to new york   this is not an opportunity to ponder or deliberate   because once he's done  he's gone   cooper  this guy have a name   they call him  the freelancer    and how do we find him   you don't find him  i do   what  are you two pen pals   you guys send each other  uh  coded e mails   i don't have e mail or a phone  or    an address   i prefer to handle my business face to face   you've met him  once   i brokered a few jobs   he works through an intermediary   he might be for sale   perhaps i should set a meeting   maybe you should   you should come   just the two of us    no wires   no clumsy agents in the bushes   you want me to make an introduction   you need to trust me with my source   ah  what fun  you'll need a dress   and where would this meeting be   montreal   what do you know about the passports   what passports   you know what i'm talking about   as far as i'm concerned  you put them there   put what  lizzy   the box  the money and the gun  the passports   who else have you told   what  nobody   have you told cooper  no   cooper  i want you to shadow reddington to montreal   contact our people in the royal canadian mounted police   i want complete surveillance   take them both down    reddington and his liaison   if you go to the police  they'll file charges   if the gun's not registered  it's a felony   the passports are 25 years each   on the other hand   if you confront him  what good does that do   he'll deny everything   and you'll continue to doubt him   either way  it's     an impossible situation   before we do this  let me be clear     i'm not here to socialize   i have no interest in having dinner with you  nor do we have the time   we meet your contact   we get the name of the freelancer's next victim   and we go  understood

some hole in the wall noodle shop   your closest friends are strangers   you understand that tight bonds can make you vulnerable   so you're careful not to have any   and that's why you're so conflicted about me   you need me   and you hate that about yourself   because it makes you vulnerable   tell me about your husband   does he know you as well as you know him     your contact is late

cartel   they brand their servants by carving their symbol  into the flesh on our backs   but as bad as i had it   there is always someone who had it worse   truth is  it's only through acknowledging  and claiming these experiences that we can really put a face  on the crime that is human sex trafficking   tonight  i'd simply like to say thank you   thank you  floriana     oh  thank you  anya   and thank you for coming tonight   i'm sure you've noticed we're not at the met   we had to relocate for security reasons   each one of you could have stayed home   succumbed to fear   but you didn't
