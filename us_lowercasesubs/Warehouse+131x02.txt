warehouse data files    no  no  no   not yet  he's just fishing   and he won't break through  okay  but  artie  who would even know about the warehouse   let alone be able to make it this far    who indeed   i'll put a trace on 'em and find out exactly  in which pond this scum resides  if we just follow     he was ready for my trace  he's very good   i tip my hat to you  sir   think we'll just have to find this guy the old fashioned way   how are you sleeping    i'm not   i could tell  your aura looks like hell   then stop looking at it   you're dripping on my floor   if you'll excuse me  i have a date with a forward pass   where's myka    she's outside on her phone   jeez   i know  i know  mom  call it a retirement party all you want   we both know dad's never letting go of about bookstore   mom  i can't  okay  i just    i have a lot going on right now   heads up    what   you all right    what is it with men and their balls   where's my phone  where is my phone    it's at your feet   a third bank was robbed on friday in chicago   so what's going on   something strange  i don't know how the robbers are doing it   so you two are going to chicago to find out   chi town   chi town   heads up   does artie seem a little    i don't know  crankier than usual   how long does it take to find a security tape   here you go    thank you   jumpy much   okay  i don't think we're getting the tape   bonnie belski  chicago  fbi   agent      bering and lattimer   what do you guys want with my robberies   hi  guys  nice ties   can we talk   we would like access to any evidence  witnesses  or leads you might have   now that i'm in your face  you ask nicely   i made a call   a bad shootout in denver gets you shipped to dc   where  together  you almost lose the president   then you get exiled off the reservation into my town  humping my leg   it's a nice leg   look  we're here to help    i don't want it   you two have a reputation for leaving disaster in your wake   your own agency doesn't know why you're here   stay away from my investigation  enjoy chicago   try the pizza   i'm in love   projet sg   agent belski will be more cooperative now   yeah  what did that cost you    a couple grand   director's a terrible poker player  so i chucked his debt   you never did me that favor    you never asked   so how you guys doing    the warehouse keeps us busy   doing what  exactly  pete    if i say anything else   mrs  frederic will pop out and go all scary face on me   give my best to myka  stay safe    will do   see  this little guilt trip  you're taking me on     i don't do that anymore  dad won't miss me   when i was there  he didn't know i was there   okay  so just     tell my mother to stop making me do her dirty work   deenie  i gotta go  working  okay  bye   don't    wasn't   i mean  it's none of my business anyway  right   but  if my dad were alive  i'd go to see him   so where are we   well     belski just got spanked   so let's go strike while the butt is still hot   all right  mr  whoever you are  trying to get into my computers   you can run through proxy servers  in yinchuan   but you cannot     hide   aren't you arts and crafty    you should see my balloon animals   my agents won't like you destroying their hard work   no  i'm enhancing it   there's a big difference between seeing something  and seeing something   we know 3 banks have been robbed on 3 successive fridays at rush hour     and it is friday  six hours to rush hour   by two suspects employing a takeover technique without guns   banks just hand over the money  everyone's shy on the details   which is strange   tell me something i don't know   mary  queen of scots' croquet mallet was made from a petrified narwhal's horn   she never lost a match   do you know how they're doing this   not yet   i'm rankled   i'm officially ranked   you had to go and call dickinson to get access   just don't take it personally    it's entirely professional   i'm just saying you could have come to me  and i could have got you whatever information that you need   we needed access  artie  not information   let me be clear  i'm your boss now   you hit a roadblock  you call me  i remove it   not daniel dickinson  me   all your old contacts are off limits  no exceptions   warehouse security demands it  understood   i got it   so can i have your attention now    show it to me   hold on  freeze   what is inside that one's coat   i don't know  a bomb   or something scared these people stupid  artie   do any of these tapes have sound    no  they're all silent   why    it's per a federal wiretap law   lest we overhear an account number not party to investigative     none of the witnesses recall any orders or demands from these robbers   no  they don't recall anything   it's kind of like they have short term memory loss or something   lights can do that   they can  like a strobe can do that  any kind of flashing     but nothing's flashing   i'm talking about something at the edge of the visual spectrum   something between the video's interlaced frames   you know  i had a case once where pollen from a prehistoric plant  turned a woman into a sexually rapacious sleepwalker   she was unaware that she was doing that until she pulled the pants off     just be quiet   what   there's a man on his cell phone during this entire robbery   do you see that    oh  really   that's good  somebody overheard what was happening in there  right   an  ear  witness   i need the other side of that call   we have ways  just get me phone guy's name   i'm looking  just give me a second   i am gonna huff and puff     and blow your house down   i got him   me too   so the guy on the phone was leaving a message on his wife's cell phone   and artie got his hands on it    don't ask me how  i don't know   nice catch    thank you   so     so     what has agent belski done for you lately   she sashays    yeah   a little bit    no   she doesn't even know it    yes  she does   she does   laura  these are agents bering and lattimer   laura was one of the tellers    i already told you everything   i don't remember anything else  i can't remember anything else   tell'em what you told me  it's okay   yeah  please  sit down   we just have a couple questions   when the suspects robbed the bank  they played a sound   do you remember hearing anything   no  nothing   we have a copy of a recording of a cell phone call  that occurred during the robbery  and we're gonna play it for you   so you just tell us what you think  whatever you can   ready    i guess so   hey  kelly  i made the deposit   so if you want to    oh  god   god  they're robbing the     you should turn it off   are you gonna play something   what's going on   nothing   you feel okay   i feel     loved   i feel loved   so she had a strong emotional reaction to the sounds on the tape   yeah  but we weren't affected   see  what i'm thinking    is that this is a limbic trigger   the sound rings a bell in the primal  the lizard part of the brain  that connects to the pleasure centers  see   but we heard it too  and my limbic's not triggered   it's not even twitching  so     i would guess you'd have to hear it through the robber's equipment   the bank teller heard it here    she heard it there for the 2nd time   so clearly  there is a sense memory component   okay  so what are we looking for   are we looking for souped up speakers or thomas edison's wax cylinder   thomas edison's what   ignore him  okay  i'm scrubbing the sound for the melody   all composers leave a chromatic dna inside their compositions  their music   that's why the beatles sound like the beatles   copeland sounds like copeland    it sounds like my dad's favorite song   what i'm doing here is i'm taking sounds   putting them through a tonal deconstruction algo    rhythm   pete  what did you say    what  no  i just     i said that it sounded like my dad's favorite song   center of my soul by the bricktones  1960 something   my dad was just nuts for those guys    eric marsden   that's him  he also wrote      angel's kiss  a night in my arms   okay  are you saying that this is one of marsden's songs   yeah  what  the bank robbery remix   give me a second   give me    one     i never heard of eric marsden    that's 'cause you were too busy  dusting off shakespeare at your dad's bookstore   when i was eight  my dad took me to the blue note in new york to see marsden   he was into jazz then  experimental stuff   same notes  exactly the same rhythm  i think this is his music   this is his music   are you sure    with a 98 7 probability   i think this is a completely new score   or it's a very old composition that's never been released until now   you're looking for an original recording of this song   you can start with marsden    where do we find him   how about 12 miles south of the robberies  he's in chicago   is he playing somewhere    he lives there    his music  local crime scenes   i say this guy just hit the top of your suspect chart   so go  go  go   four hours to rush hour    you're driving   and you're sure about this too   you found the person hacking into the warehouse   the network intrusion came from washington   with a 90      do you have a suspect   who's this    pete and myka's ex boss   dickinson    daniel dickinson   so the breach came from secret service   if i'm right     and i'm right    directly from his office computer   artie  what are you gonna do   stop it   looks like somebody might have fallen on hard times  huh   hard enough to rob banks   just hold it right there   whatever it is you're selling  i am not interested   we're with the government  we'd like to speak with eric marsden  please   what for   suspicion of bank robbery   you gotta be kidding me   when my voice went  i needed something to do   i backed him up on over 50 records  so i guess this ain't much different   i've been his caretaker going on five years now   does he have any family    ex wife  she got remarried   she started a new family a long time ago   what about children    one kid  haven't talked in years   so will he talk to us   well  he's bipolar  clinically depressed and semi catatonic   last month  he was diagnosed with liver cancer  but  hey  go for it   how much time does he have left   maybe a year   you ask the questions  not you  your timber will bug him   and cell phones off  no ringing   and sure hell no vibrating  or he's gonna start screaming   so get to it  it's almost lunch   mr  marsden   my name is myka  this is my friend   we'd like to ask you     a few questions   we're looking into some trouble  that we think might be connected with something you wrote   a song  possibly   sir   you have a beautiful voice   someone once told me that i have the voice of a barmaid   he doesn't hear you   eric     is there something you wrote that affects people   makes them    happy   i mean  i'm not explaining this very well   did you see it   see what   everything   did you write that piece of music  eric   i want my grilled cheese now   eric went from pop to jazz to experimental to just plain weird   you know  he lived in the studio   writing and mixing and playing  thousands of hours of music   he said he was looking for the key    the key to what   i don't know   the human heart   peace  something   so where's his music now    stolen  ask me  that's what broke him   stolen how    ever heard of jeff canning   windy lake records    that's him   so what happened   what always happens when an artist meets a con man   one of them gets rich  and the other one loses an ear   eric didn't care about the money   canning stole his music rights in a terrible deal   eric was never the same after that   and now canning is sitting on everything   so if you're looking for a criminal  talk to mr  canning   that it   and thanks    for playing the piano   he hasn't touched it in years  but i always keep it tuned   it's good to hear it again   i didn't know you played    i had a crush on my piano teacher   i used to love going to lessons    let's go see mr  canning  shall we   so was that your dad who said you sounded like a barmaid   drop it  pete   it's hard to when you're on the phone every 30 minutes   okay  look  my family is having a party next week   you satisfied   the world will survive without you for a day  okay   go be with your family   you make it sound so    cosy   what's the problem   you ever see that movie the great santini   with the tough dad and the scared kids   it's like that  huh   yeah  except it wasn't over in two hours   windy lake records  this is stephanie  todd  hi   the boss was wondering if you'd mailed his all access pass this year   yeah  well  is there any way that we could     okay  well  i guess we'll just wait for your call then   thanks   so it looks like the boss man fell off the rich and powerful list   you got that from ogling the help   the offices near the elevator are empty   the magazines are three months old    well  money's tight all over   except the banks in chicago are just giving it away  right   any idea which one might be next    i'm working on it   but if there's a link  i'm not seeing it yet   hi  i'm jeff canning   hey  jeff  agent pete lattimer    agent bering   and what can i do for the government today   well  i have a few questions about an artist you represent   i made a lot of deals over the years   bought and sold libraries   but ultimately  my job is to get the music out there   what about eric marsden's music   he isn't selling these days  he's kind of fallen out of fashion   but i do have an offer on the table to buy his stuff   course  if you want to better it  it's yours   who wants it    anonymous buyer   i suspect it's a collector in japan  they love the bubble gum   this is eric   all his hits  his misfires  work for hire stuff   what's this   experimental self indulgence that will probably never see the light of day   why is that   costs more to market than you could ever get in return   for this  i blame jed fissel   jed fissel    eric's engineer   he bought into eric's search for a new sound  that people needed to hear  new age crap   they spent way too much of my money looking for it   and most of it sounds like bricks in a blender   where's     so  where's fissel now   last i heard  he was driving a cab downtown   but that was years go  look  what's this all about   well  somebody's robbing banks in chicago   and we think that something that marsden wrote might be involved   anyone can find his stuff in flea markets   resale shops  peer to peer networks   no  it's something unreleased  something the public has never heard until now   not possible   everything is right here  and i've got the only key   mr  canning  your lunch date's here  and i forwarded the phones   thank you  stephanie  you can take off   half days   it's no secret the industry's going through a few changes   save a penny  earn a penny   the fbi has company  secret service is on us now   why    doesn't matter   how's the money    laundered and ready to go   you give the word and everything happens   what's with the getup    we need more   the situation's changed    let's go   jed fissel  eric marsden's recording engineer   last known address  fultondale  alabama   been off the grid for six months   dead    unknown   there's a pattern  we're missing something that we're not seeing   fridays    rush hour    no  besides that   why these banks  these branches  and they're all over the city   fbi   i've got some pissed off agents who wanna take away your scissor privileges   if i had a nickel   look  you gave us the sound thing  so i'm returning the favor   we're setting up at midwesterner bank on grand   based on what   i was going over the rush hour traffic patterns around the other banks   those streets are jammed  except for a few  specific  not well known routes   this bank fits the bill   this crew knows the way in and out of these areas like no one else   except maybe cab drivers   ask her about jed fissel   the fbi is staking out the midwesterner on grand   belski has a vibe    do you   then i say they're wrong  we're on this   but what if it goes down  and we're not there   fine  go  play footsie with the fbi   what    leave the farnsworth   call me if you get something   hi  mom   well  i'm sorry  he's canceling it  but don't make this my fault   it's okay  i got it   myka  are you there   finally   for crying out     you know how when you sing in the shower   and it bounces off the tiles  and you sound spectacular   no  i never sound spectacular  what are you talking about   the banks are all like that  artie   they're all marble and stone   and this music is knocking people sideways because     it resonates inside the banks    like mad   something in the source material is     amplified by the bank's designs   okay  i need you to compare all the architecture  and interior dimensions of fidelity mutual  against all the banks in the chicago area that haven't been robbed   yet    yes   and marsden  is he still a suspect    no  he's dying of cancer   but his sound engineer  jed fissel  the guy who actually made the recording   is unaccounted for   hold the line  please   forgot something   who the     what was that   kodak moment   the number of un robbed banks that fit the acoustic profile  of the already robbed banks  is that what you're looking for   it is exactly     two    two   great  where   it'll be okay  stevie   what is it you do  exactly   part of the homeland security thing   i can't tell you what i do  exactly   how does someone get invited to your party   well    you don't     you don't get invited  you get shoved   how long have you and bering been partners   not long   she's wound pretty tight   yes  she is   her history doesn't bother you  denver   she did her best   the agent who died in the shootout  sam martino   there's scuttlebutt   apparently  martino and your partner were having an affair   and he was married   well  separated  but still   lattimer    myka nailed him   the targeted banks have the same acoustic profile   and i should have figured that out  and i didn't   where is she   federal agent  stop   what happened    marble  stone and big  high ceilings   that's what the music needs to work  wanna ask the recording engineer   jed fissel     meet the fbi   if you ask nicely  he might give you the other two   lock it up  i need video  i need tech out here right now   it's a gray van  no windows  no plates  and the right rear tire is walled   they're using a record player  like a close'n play   so there's a record    possibly in a silver case   i got hit with it   there's three suspects  including fissel  one was a woman   you sure    yeah  i     felt her   you touched her boobies   like  that hurts   the hell are you    my name     it doesn't matter  but i think you know who i represent   flash gordon   you know  i did a lot of work  a lot of research   i traced packets through network systems all over the world   until i finally figured out it's that computer  your computer right over there  that initiated the security breach into my business   why'd you do it  what do you want   all right  you listen to me   whoever you are  if you're gonna kill me or whatever that thing does  do it   but if you're gonna talk about nonsense  then get the hell out of my office   i know that you did it   warehouse 13   i got hacked   buddy    you got punk'd   i didn't hack you   hey  look    i screwed up  okay   i'm sorry you got hit    don't worry about it   let's just get fissel talking  find this record  and go home   all right   do you still have those earplugs  put 'em in   watch out   fbi  stop   whoever did this mirrored these 12 proxies  and ran the breach through here   i didn't see that   i bet an entire floor of analysts at the nsa would have missed it too   i mean  you traced it this far   the rest should be easy  let me work it from here   let    no   what i need is 30 minutes alone with this terminal   not possible   don't ask   artie  i need you to find my cell phone   i'm not your personal cell phone locator  okay   no  we just lost a suspect  they hit us with the music and took him   are you okay  is pete okay   i'm fine  pete's still     a little affected by the music   he's making a love connection    he's mak     a what   look  i managed to get my cell phone into one of their pockets   find it and tell us where we need to go   okay  i'll get back to you as soon as i can  all right   so how they doing    you know  they're     mostly  they're a pain in my ass    so am i   i'm not leaving   this is warehouse 13    this is my office   you wanna use my computer to poke around in your problem   i'm staying   got your 30 minutes  i suggest you not waste it   could you at least    avert your eyes  all right   i mean occasionally   all right  thank you   don't you wanna find myka's cell phone   right  i     belski doesn't seem too bothered by her case kicking her in the ass   artie's tracing my phone   what are you    what are you doing   i like your perfume   i'm not wearing perfume    whatever you're wearing  i love it   stephanie   canning's assistant   hot damn   i found your cell phone   is it there    no   where's jed and stephanie   it was never about the money   where's the record   it was never about the money   she missed her father   she had to bring him home   canning said he had a buyer    an anonymous buyer   his daughter   everything fell apart  he couldn't write anymore   he lost his music  he lost his daughter   there was nothing left for him to hold on to   so he let go   we have to call the fbi   why    why not   the bank robberies   they're not our problem   that is our problem   belski will find them   maybe   but maybe not   i gotta take this   hi  mom   can i talk to dad   you're putting that back together  right   you know    good as new   okay  mr  knock knock   we're gonna open the door and see who you are   you have to stop   hello   you've got to     who's there    make it stop   you gotta stop her    someone's there  i can     what the hell was that   you okay   me  sure  you know  just     a little    shock
