 hi  i'm heather   that's a 2 4 liter  i can't teach you how to drive cars   that's right   wanna take a look under the hood   yeah   you know your z  i'm impressed   you should have your mechanic check it out anyway   how about i leave you my number and we can set it up   thank you   so it's just    right up here   oh  that was   ha ha    hello  there was the right   uh  maybe just    pull over here  and we can try and do a u turn   what are you doing   okay   stop the car now   pull over now   how about andrew  it's greek for valiant   let's call him    sergio   ha ha  please tell me you're kidding     butch    how about donald     hans    no  wait  wait  um       okay  gideon    not a chance   it's hebrew  look what it means   it's perfect  gideon hotchner     no    yes     no    gideon   stations and movie theaters     uh  the mad bomber  george metesky    nice   the winners sit  losers  drink   cheers   hold on  metesky wasn't a serial killer  none of his bombs ever killed anyone   well  you think all we do is serial killers  trust me     we cover the whole spectrum of psychos   we profiled the d c  sniper  the unabomber  we do terrorists  arsonists    supervisory agents trying to get trainees drunk   excuse me   wow  behavioral analysis unit  you work with gideon   were you with him in boston   i was supposed to be   yeah  this is morgan   anyone recognize these faces   victims of the footpath killer   that's what virginia newspapers are calling him   we refer to him as the unknown subject or unsub   i told virginia p d     we're looking for a white male in his 20's     who owns an american made truck in disrepair   works a menial job   i told 'em when you find him     don't be surprised to hear him speak with a severe stutter   not to sound skeptical  but come on    a stutter   where'd the murders occur   hiking paths  isolated   if i'm a killer who has to use an immediate application of overpowering force   even out in the middle of nowhere   i lack confidence   i can't charm them into my car like ted bundy did   i can't because i am ashamed of something   excuse me   they're calling him the seattle strangler  4 victims in 4 months   he keeps 'em alive 7 days  the handle serves as a crank   allowing him to control the rate of suffocation     to prolong it    to enjoy it   seattle's hit a wall   physical evidence is nonexistent  there are no tangible leads   and another girl is missing   i looked the case file over  i'll get some thoughts to you asap   you're gonna be with us in seattle asap    before she left for lunch  she downloaded an email with a time delayed virus attached   the killer's virus wiped her hard drive and left this on the screen    for heaven's sake  catch me before i kill more  i cannot control myself    he never keeps them for more than 7 days   which means we have fewer than 36 hours to find her   they want you back in the saddle   you ready   looks like medical leave's over  boss   they sure they want me   the order came from the director   well  we'd better get started   joseph conrad said    the belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary   men alone are quite capable of every wickedness    this girl may only have 36 hours to live   we're not asking for a judgment of gideon   we want an assessment   we want to know you're there to step in if he can't perform   are we clear   of course   his first victim was    stab wounds  strangulation    wait  wait  back up  back up   he stabbed her       and then strangled her to finish her off    other way around   why do you think he started using the belt with the second murder   strangulation with your bare hands is not as easy as one would believe   he tried  probably found that it took too long     so he stabbed her instead   and realized it would be hours cleaning up the blood   next time  our boy's got a method   the belt   he's learning  perfecting his scenario   becoming a better killer   what did i tell you about the tape   i'm sorry  i'm sorry  i'm sorry   he never stands with his back to a window   when i was between him and a doorway  he asked me to move   that's hyper vigilance  it's not uncommon in post traumatic stress disorder   just how much disorder are we talking about   morgan  it's been 6 months  everything's ok   this is special agent gideon   special agent morgan  our expert on obsessional crimes   special agent reid   dr  reid   dr  reid  our expert on     well  everything  and after 2 years busting my butt in this office   i hope you all remember me   he's willing to travel with the body   then he drives a vehicle capable of concealing one      explorer with tinted windows    explorers rate higher with women   but how do we know it's his car  ted bundy drove a vw bug     what about a jeep cherokee    jeep's are more masculine   we all know how an unsub feels about asserting his masculinity   when did the bureau become involved in the case   after the fourth body  he dumped that one out of state   on purpose   if so  knowledge of law enforcement does suggest a criminal record   or that he watches television  may i   so you wanna see our suspect list   no  we won't look at a suspect list until after we come up with a profile   it keeps our perspective unbiased     when do we sit down with your task force    4 00     an accurate profile by 4 00 today    that's not a problem   agent gideon  where would you like to start   let's start at the site of the last murder     so that's gideon    the gideon   the one who caught that guy  adrian baal  in boston   yep  that's him  but catching him cost us 6 agents   was found right here   nails clipped just like the others   he wants them to fight back   but not enough to hurt him   and he left the belt around her neck   he's probably in his early 20's   what's your reasoning   youthful arrogance   he clothed the body before dumping it   that's a sign of remorse   it's not consistent  look where we are   his opinion of women is pretty clear  don't you think   they're disposable   why show remorse by taking the time to dress her but then dump her here     sandy  no  no  no  i'm so sorry    no  it's ok   it's what we call the reid effect   happens with children  too   i'm agent hotchner  this is special agent dr  reid   you look too young to have gone to medical school   they're phd's  3 of them   are you a genius or something   i don't believe that intelligence can be accurately quantified    but i do have an i q  of 187 and an eidetic memory and can read 20 000 words per minute   yes  i'm a genius   sandy  you get a lot of attention  don't you   yeah  heather loves this dog   i feed her when heather's away  usually  she's fine  but     lately  she won't eat  it's almost like she can sense something's wrong   not sense  smell   our apocrine sweat gland releases secretions in response to emotional stress   sandy's worried because she knows you are   david  does your sister drive a datsun z   no  but she's in the market for one  how'd you know   come on  sandy   there's an immediate relationship established between a buyer and a seller  a level of trust   if i want to coax a young woman into my car     offer her a test drive   okay  then how about the fact that on one hand  we have paranoid psychosis     but the autopsy protocol says what   adhesive reside shows he put layer after layer of duct tape over his victims' eyes   he knows he wants to kill them  but he still covers their eyes   he doesn't want 'em looking at him  apparently   okay  but then he takes the body and dumps it right out in the open  murder weapon nearby   not the m o  of a paranoid convinced he's being watched or surveilled   paranoid psychosis  but behavior that's not paranoid   all right  enough   let's tell them we're ready   we're ready   reid  you're good with this   we've got a woman who's only got a few hours left to live   an incomplete profile  and a unit chief on the verge of a nervous breakdown   they don't call them nervous breakdowns anymore     it's called a major depressive episode    i know  reid   the unidentified subject is white and in his late 20's   he's someone you wouldn't notice at first   he's someone who'd blend into any crowd   the violent nature of the crime suggests a previous criminal record    petty crimes  maybe auto theft   we've classified him as an organized killer   careful   psychopathic as opposed to psychotic   he follows the news  has good hygiene  he's smart   'cause he's smart  the only physical evidence you'll find is what he wants you to find   he's mobile  car in good condition  our guess   jeep cherokee  tinted windows   the murders have all involved rapes   but rape without penetration is a form of piquerism   and that tells us he's sexually inadequate   psychiatric evaluations will show a history of paranoia  stemming from a childhood trauma    death of a parent or family member   and now he feels persecuted and watched   murder gives him a sense of power   organized killers have a fascination with law enforcement   they will inject themselves into the investigation   they will even come forward as witnesses to see just how much the police really know   that makes them feel powerful  in control   which is why i also think     in fact  i know    you have already interviewed him   hi  i'm sorry to bother you   i'm house sitting down the street  and when i got back  the door was wide open   and the lights weren't working   i feel stupid asking this  but is there someone who might be able to take a look inside with me   richard  richard  get down here     are you sure you locked it    yeah   hello     hello    fbi  freeze  freeze  get him down   richard slessman  fbi  you are under arrest for the murder     emerson said    all is riddle  and the key to a riddle     is another riddle    there's no sign of the girl here  we can arrest him with probable cause   but we won't be able to hold him   slessman's been at the top of the suspect list   is that the mother   grandmother  the mother died in a fire when he was 13   probably not the only fire in his childhood   before his son of sam murders  david berkowitz set a multitude of fires   exactly how much is a multitude     according to his diary  1 400 and      88   luring him out was your idea  right  greenway   elle  i don't send a swat team into a house with children   hotch says your background is in sex offender cases   what can you tell us   the last 4 murders show he's an anger excitation rapist   he'll keep a victim for a couple of days   he probably records or videotapes them so that he can keep reliving the fantasy   you ok with hotch being in on the interview     i'd like him to lead  actually    fine  but hold off   slessman's done time  and he knows the process   and all you will get now is a demand for a lawyer   hotch  let's check the garage  then show me what you got   next time  show a little leg   morgan  the only time you're gonna see a little leg from me is when i'm about to kick your ass   i still teach hand to hand over at quantico if you need a little brush up training   seriously    i want that opening at bau     you got any advice    just trust your instincts   well  we got the jeep right  and everything else wrong   the bodies had defensive wounds  richard doesn't have a mark on him   we're missin' something   something's not right about this   this is a boy's room    not a man's   log in password   no  no   wait  wait     it's not turning back on    yeah  and it won't   it was a false password     what kind of game is it    in china  it's called wei chi   here we call it  go   it's considered to be the most difficult board game ever conceived   chairman mao required his generals to learn it   it also looks like he's playing himself   how can you tell   this might provide an advantage  actually   go is considered to be a particularly psychologically revealing game   there are profiles for every player    the conservative point counter  the aggressor  the finesser   what kind of player is slessman   extreme aggressor   okay  here we go   what's the number 6 at the bottom of the screen   number of password attempts before the program wipes the hard drive   there could be an email   or a journal in the computer  something that tells us where heather is   do you think you can break in   in 6 tries   try again  fail again  fail better     samuel beckett    try not   do or do not   yoda   i wanna talk to him   you read my paper  learn anything   heirens said a man living inside of his head was the one who committed the murders   you said he was lying  that there'd never been an actual case of multiple personalities   you have an academic interest in disassociative identity disorder   or you just planning your defense   you a fan of adrian baal's work   no   i'm a fan of yours   you know     they never give you the real facts about cpr     that outside of a hospital  it's only effective 7  of the time   your friend had a 93  certainty of dying   but you kept trying    even after you'd broken his ribs   even after his blood was all over your hands   why don't you tell us where heather woodland is   woodland     isn't she the girl that went missing a couple days ago   get him out of here     hey    he is  isn't she the girl        if he'd already killed her  he would have said      wasn't she the girl      she's alive  we don't know for how long   is it true what he said about cpr  i mean  i didn't know   you want statistics on cpr  ask reid     i wanna know if you're ok    i'm fine     are you    think i can't do the job   i think you can't be 2 different people at once   what is it   conflicts in the profile     2 different behaviors    2 different people   there's a second killer   not unusual  remember lawrence bittaker and roy norris   and murder girls in california   we're looking for someone who fits a similar relationship   they're not equals  slessman's smart  but he is a submissive personality     so number 2 is the dominant    authoritative  arrogant   probably not as smart as slessman   he's like the schoolyard bully recruiting a good underling   he'll be protective of richard   he'll make him feel like he owes him   if richard's been up in the attic fantasizing about being an extreme aggressor   this guy showed him how to do it   he helped him take the first step   i think we should interview him     use this as pressure    no  no  we need leverage     a name    from the suspect list   that'll take too long  there's gotta be a faster way   there is   here  this might be a little hot   mrs  slessman  i don't think we've got the right guy   i think the person we're looking for might be a friend of richard's     richard never had many friends    you sure   there's gotta be someone   you've reached penelope garcia in the fbi's office of supreme genius   hey  it's morgan  need you to work me some magic here   i got a program called deadbolt defense and a girl with only a couple of hours to live     so what do you know    then you've got a problem   deadbolt's the number one password crack resistant software out there   you're gonna have to get inside this guy's head to get the password   i thought i was calling the office of supreme genius   well  gorgeous  you've been rerouted to the office of too friggin' bad   thanks anyway   well  there was    there was this one young man   i think his name was charlie   cross reference charlie for the second unsub   charlie is probably charles linder   he was slessman's cellmate and     received a dishonorable discharge from the military   he's bigger  tougher  he could have protected richard in prison     where were they incarcerated    cascadia     less than a mile from here    let's go   my name is richard slessman  and i have trouble sleeping   okay  what do i do when i'm trying to get to sleep   guys  a little help   we're going through every one of these cd's   scratches  wear and tear   i wanna know which cd he plays the most  let's go     we get an address on linder    it's coming right now   does senior management want a field assessment on gideon   don't worry about it  are they nervous about him being in charge   aren't you on your way back to slessman's house to help morgan   do you know why he always introduces me as dr  reid   because he knows that people see you as a kid  and he wants to make sure that they respect you   what's the address   don't think it matters anymore   winston churchill said    the farther backward you can look  the farther forward you will see    anyone who can tell us more about slessman   tim vogel was the security guard covering slessman's block     that's him over there    i'll get him for you   that was hotch  linder's name came up on a police report     and    he's dead   car accident  2 months ago   linder is dead   too bad you guys came here for nothing   i mean  talk about scum   i can't remember how many times i put linder in solitary for causing trouble with us   you'd think the inmates would try to stay on our good side  right   especially since half our job is protecting them from each other   you protect them   if you're a little white guy   especially in a prison like this   linder's 6'4   you talking about slessman   oh  yeah   thanks for your help   he's a friend of richard  he protected him  he will feel like he owes him     he fits the profile  and did you see them    the keys   hotch  i've just found your leverage  his name is timothy vogel   what's he doing   lowering the room temp  the cold puts them on edge   okay  so i want an spd  and i want a seattle agent in the room   i want him to see that we've got every department working on this  and i need some file boxes   fill them  i don't care if the paper's blank   and i want you to write the name on the sides   whose name    it's not your file  see  we don't care about you   it's vogel we want   oh  come on  i need a password  i need a password   what am i looking for  what could i possibly be looking for     i've been thinking about the cd's    oh  reid  come on  we tried the cd's   we searched  sifted  and sorted through every one of this guy's head banging heavy metal collection   we gotta find something  or this girl is dead   think we may have missed the obvious   what are you doing   reid  what made you think of this   it was the only empty case   all right  i'm an insomniac who listens to metallica to go to sleep at night   what song could possibly speak to me    enter sandman    we found out heather was buying a used car   you know how car salesmen get us to buy a car   they call it reciprocity  they drop the price   feels like they've done us a favor  we feel obligated   there's a sudden pressure to reciprocate this one little favor   and it's so powerful that we'll     put a deposit down on a car we're not even sure we really want     so what    so vogel did you a favor   he protected you in prison  and now you feel like you owe him   and you need to protect him   guys like vogel learn in the schoolyard which kids to bully and which kids to protect   and he's got you convinced that you owe him so much  that you'll go to jail for him   richard  i'm here to remind you something   you owe him nothing   there's something wrong   we gotta him pull over  i can feel it   you wanna know the word repeated more than any other in your file   impatient   you wanna stop him  you give me a reason   his behavior  when we left him  he was nervous  unsettled   but now he's stopping at every stop sign  he's using his blinker at every turn   he's slowing at yellow lights  this is not someone who is rushing to kill and dump a body   okay  do it   fbi  put your hands up where we can see them   put your hands through the window now  now   all right  with your left hand i want you to open the car door from the outside   get out     it's not him    where is he  where is he     where's vogel    i don't know   what are you doin' driving his car    he came up to me in the garage after our shift ended   he asked if he could borrow my truck     what kind of truck    he's dumping the body     what's the make  what's the make     dodge  dodge dakota     gideon  heather's alive    how do you know   'cause we're watching her right now   hotch  he's gonna kill her  he's heading there now  we need a location   i don't have enough time to get it out of him   find something  hotch  or that girl is dead   morgan  can you show me the last 12 images lined up next to each other   yeah   right there   right there  you see that  the light bulb hanging from the wire   yeah  what about it   it's shifting positions like it's swaying     like the earth is tilting   not the earth  doc  the ocean   she's on a boat  where   it's a pier or a dock  he wouldn't be able to transmit the webcam image from the middle of the ocean     you're sure about this    it's the best we got  hotch   even if we're right  getting the exact location's on you  my friend   what is it you always ask garcia   to work me a little magic   just to let you know    gideon's talking to vogel     and vogel's nailing you to the wall   yeah  whatever   he said it was your idea to keep the girls on a boat   he's talking  richard   reciprocity   tell me where she is  and we make a deal   is it a dock   a pier   it's a shipyard   allied shipyard   reid  he's inside   get elle on the phone     listen to me  you need to wait for backup    if we wait  the girl is dead     and if we had waited in boston     i can't   you told me to trust my instincts   stop     stop    get back     i'll shoot her    i wouldn't   if i were you  i'd aim the gun at me  you shoot the girl  you got nothing   get    back   shoot me instead   come on  what  are you a lousy shot   perfect shot  shoot me     you think i'm stupid    i think you're an absolute moron   i know all about ya  tim   you're at the gym 5 times a week  you drive a flashy car   you stink of cologne  and you can't get it up   not even viagra's workin' for ya  you know what that tells me   that tells me you are hopelessly compensating  and it's not just in your head   it is physical   what did the girls call you in high school   what'd they come up with when you fumbled your way into some girl's pants   and she started laughing when she got a good look at just how little you had to offer     shut up    short stack  very little vogel   i got it  tiny tim   gideon     you ok    i'm fine   go look after the girl   so what kind of report do they want on him   i suppose whether he's fit to be a field agent   you know  haley and i were looking at a baby names book  guess what gideon means in hebrew   mighty warrior   appropriate   so what are you gonna tell them   what would you say   gideon saved her life   that's good enough for me   hey   you and haley pick the baby's name yet   it's funny    haley liked the name charles     but  you know    all i could think of      manson     then there was henry    lee lucas     uh    jeffrey    dahmer   there's just too many of them   kind of hard to feel good about catching one when you know there are 50 more still out there   how's your report going   didn't think you could hide that from an old profiler  now  did ya   you know  you saved that girl today     you can feel good about that    it is good   it's a good thing   nietzsche once said    when you look long into an abyss   the abyss looks into you    i'll take this   have a n i   n nice day
