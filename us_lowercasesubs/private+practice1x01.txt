addison take the job anyway  wasn't she some big hotshot in seattle   is it just me  or did naomi just run over us with a steamroller     is she crazy    naomi's insane   i mean addison  is she some kind of crazy person  who gets kissed once and decides to change her whole life   you kissed addison  really     focus    focus   look  i know she has the largest chunk of this practice   but we agreed to equal votes   we are supposed to vote  sam  you gotta do something     yeah  what  me    this divorce is killing us   you need to apologize  just say you were wrong  for walking out so we can get back to being a happy family   i never    i didn't     i am not apologizing to her  she's the one   naomi hires addison and then moves her in right next door to me     i saw her naked this

alternative medicine guru   do you know how many babies i deliver a day   well  here you'll be lucky if you deliver one   one patient the entire day   i told you  we do things differently here   this may be a big city   but this co op is about practicing small town medicine   every patient is special  every patient gets our full attention   it's not about surgeries but connecting  i told you this

we started this practice  is to be in charge of our own destiny   very real  you know  internet sex   but she wanted me to call her mama   but she promised all this really freaky stuff   and i'm talking  like  stuff   okay  eww  that's it  i'm done     no  what  why    because you're a sex addict   or an internet addict or some kind of freaky addict   yeah  you're a stalker  you're stalking your married ex boyfriend   i am not  i'm     calling him occasionally     stalker    okay  you know what  that's it   i'm cutting you off  for your own good  i won't help you anymore     oh  come on  stalker    i'm not a stalker   hey  i  uh     just wanted to say that i am really sorry  about naomi and the job  i     i got a 911 page   do you think there's something wrong with  having sex with a woman  who wants you to call her    mama     there's a patient for you    thank god   no  not him  you   this is bill henderson and his daughter lucy   this is dr  montgomery  she'll be delivering your baby   it hurts  it hurts  doesn't it  it's what you get for getting pregnant   she hid it from me for months  and all of a sudden it's   daddy  i'm in labor    how about we get you into the birthing suite   dell  see if we have a chart on lucy   hey  can i get in on this  i haven't gotten a lot of field experience  for my midwife training  i need the hours   how about you just find the chart   ken's sperm     you want us to take ken's sperm right out of       are you sure    i'm sure     i mean  you can do it  right    look here   you're distressed  i understand   unless you have written consent from the deceased   no way am i gonna let you molest your husband's corpse   well    okay  well  let's not use words  like  molest  or  corpse  about her loved one   and it's her boyfriend  not her husband   well  fine   she wants sperm of a man she has no legal rights to   that makes it all better  no   okay  hey  let's     can we stop    charlotte  right   you know my name  sam  don't act like you don't   i'm chief of staff here  and you know it   you and i  we    we can work on this together   we can figure this out because i'm a good person   you're a good person   we    i mean we can    right  we can    together   i did read your book  by the way     oh  great    i took issue with most of it   see  now i'm on her side   we want ken's sperm  or you got a fight on your hands   that dead man's swimmers are staying exactly where they are   you got a way to fight me on that  i'd like to see you try   i'm calling naomi on you   lucy henderson   she was my patient till she got pregnant   no previous medical problems  it looks good   well  the dad is mad as hell  i could use your help in there   oh  yeah  no  that    down there is not my area   so when the baby comes out  i'd be happy to examine it   until then  godspeed   give me two secs to grab my kit  i'll join you   for   if you'd read further in her chart   you'd see she has a holistic birth plan     oh  my god  are you kidding me    laboring moms love pete   hey  listen  um     you moving here     that didn't have anything to do with me kissing you  did it   what   it's okay  it's just that     well  you should know it was just a kiss   wait  you think that i moved here because you kissed me   it was a good kiss   it was an excellent kiss  but     stop talking   all right   i did not move here because you kissed me   okay   you are actually deranged enough to think  that i would pick up my entire life and move because of a kiss   let me clear that up for you  i wouldn't   okay   shut up  just go in there  and do your little eastern voodoo thing you do   and let's help that girl have her baby in peace   what do you expect me to do  he was your patient   my patient's dead   this is about your patient who wants a dead man's sperm     besides  i got mad    you got mad     i got mad    you got mad   apparently neither one of us can make good decisions when we're mad   another doctor in the practice is a very good decision   we agreed that when we split  we would not let it affect the work   my work is fine   in fact  watch me take care of my patient   where do you think you're going   if the hospital's not gonna touch the body  then i will   you lay a hand on that man  and i will have you arrested   i'm not a person who plays games  naomi  you know that   now please step back   okay  now i'm mad   i told you   you know  i could help  you know  with lucy     i'm good    you don't take me seriously   you think i'm dumb surfer boy  you think i'm eye candy   you have no respect for me or my midwifery skills   i have    total respect for you and your    midwifery skills   is    is that even a word  midwifery   it's a word   it's definitely a word   jenny   she's

these are ken and leslie's medical records   including ken's signature on a contract with my office  regarding his donation   now i think that is more than implied   live consent is different       you're considering this    it could be persuasive in a court   your patient will sign something indemnifying us against legal action   she just wants her baby   fine  you do the procedure  you take possession of the sperm   thank you for your help   well done   very badass   i know  right   get away from me   it's good     are you dr  naomi bennett    i am   you better get that little tramp's

lucy  wake up  lucy  wake up   lucy  get her on high flow oxygen  get an ambulance  dell     just holding her hand    she's having a heart failure   ambulance  now   lucy  honey  her mom died    in childbirth   she died having lucy   i'm applying pressure  but the cord is compressed       she's gonna be okay  right    and lucy's blood  is flooding her lungs  and the umbilical cord  is cutting off the baby's blood supply     i just called the ambulance    how long for an ambulance to get here    addison  we don't have 10 to 20 minutes     i know    we're gonna lose her and the baby   i know   i thought you might be hungry   you'll have to pay for it   that and the ice pack    and the flip flops     thanks   you okay   yeah  it's just     look  i know her  she's been coming to see me for months   and she's gentle   paul   look  i'm sorry  but i don't think     i don't think you know exactly how to handle this   i do know how to handle this   there has gotta be something here that i'm not seeing  she's not telling me   no offense  but if she's not telling her shrink things   then you must not be very good at your job   you know what  patients hold things in  they hold things in for years     what's up    just do    do not touch her     i'm sorry  violet    paul  think of your sister  please     i'm working here  cooper    really  it looks like you're shopping   it's a joke  dell told me you were here   i just thought i'd come by  see if you needed any help   no  i don't need any help  okay   and you know what  this    you got in your car  you drove  all the way down here to see if i was still mad at you   who is the stalker now  let's just all settle down   i'm sorry  i gotta let 'em take her   if she gets violent with you again     violent  she got violent with you     come    just    your pupils      not now  cooper   this is a psychiatric emergency   i can handle this  i can stabilize her   just give me a minute and give me backup if i need it   i just feel    if i knew how it started or where she was when it happened     so    how do you figure out how it started   you    you have security cameras  don't you   he told me he wanted to find himself  turns out he wanted to find me   only 15 years younger and half as smart   any idea what that's like  i think i can imagine   like i don't feel my age  i don't feel scared   only i feel it alone while he's yanking in a cup  for some chick he met hiking in sedona   maria  i i know this is unfair  i understand  believe me   you know  i was with him 17 years   maria  ken really wanted leslie to have his baby   and leslie wants leslie to have ken's money   i don't think that she would do that   i didn't think my husband would dump me  so there you go   if you want protection     legal protection     i think that leslie would agree to whatever you ask   i don't want protection  i want ken's sperm   what   for myself   now we'll see who ends up alone  right   where the hell is the ambulance     addison  you have to make a choice    what do you mean  make a choice   if i wait any longer for the ambulance   i could lose them both   or i could get the baby out and maybe save them   save them  of course   maybe   maybe save them  dell  glove up   i need you to decompress the cord  come here     like this    yes  that's good  steady pressure   okay   i need to be in a hospital   there's no way i can perform a c section here   it's not sterile  i don't have any surgical equipment     addison     no extra blood and an epidural would take way too long to take effect   addison  she's a heathly 17 years old   no one could have foreseen this issue   do you know what happens to a person  when a scalpel slices into them without anesthesia     addison  i       shut up   i am trying to talk myself into this   and i cannot do it when you keep addisoning me   so just    hold on   okay   pete  take over for dell  dell  go find a surgical tray from somewhere   she's gonna feel every slice  but we have to try   i'm going to scrub in and find sterile drapes   we have a local anesthetic  right  that will help with the pain     stop addisoning me    i can treat her  so she won't feel any pain   the cameras show her on this aisle   she stopped  next thing  she's looking at the floor   maybe some kind of camping accident   something traumatic  or may     maybe  you know  this guy  uh  he works here   he told me that marshmallow gets so hot  it sticks like napalm   that's not that bad  i guess   not bad enough for tile counting   they had a house at the lake   i've stimulated the needles  lidocaine's in   her pain receptors are blocked  she's ready   are you sure she's not gonna feel anything     i'm sure    if she wakes up screaming in pain     i'm sure  i'm very good at what i do   are you really  really  really sure   trust me   okay   here we go   i'm gonna cut on three   one     two     three     okay  okay   okay   did i or did i not say trust me   you did  and i do    now   that was good  it was good   there's no time to celebrate  we have to move fast   both mom and baby are still in danger   she can't just swoop in and take it   she was divorcing ken's sperm   she was with ken for  i thought we were on leslie's side     you would    she's your patient   you know  a marriage should count for something   and it doesn't  he just moved on   oh  come on  could we please not make this about us right now   i'm talking about ken  he bailed  she got nothing   he died  all things considered  i'd rather be her   you wanna be the one people feel sorry for     the one who got left    i didn't     don't you think for one moment that i have been taking any of this lightly   oh  no  you walked out   i did not walk out   i said i was unhappy  that i was questioning   and instead of trying  instead of working on it  you just shut the door   you weren't in love anymore   now how are we supposed to work on that   i never said that   i am not an idiot  i knew exactly what you were saying   so then you fight   you have some passion about the thing   i wanted to see you fight    just once    for us   naomi  i'm sorry     profoundly    for hurting you   but you're fooling yourself if you think you're the only one who got left   what are we looking for   stop talking so i can think   something in the ad     that's what triggered her   did you have a boy   jenny  did you have a son that we haven't talked about   did something happen to him   jenny     did he     did    did you lose your son  did he pass away   you're gonna make me lose my place       he died    one  two  three  one  two  three   one  two  three  four  one  two  three  four   one  two  three  four  one  two  three     if you really want ken's sperm  you can fight it out   you probably have more rights than leslie   but with all the legal wrangling   most likely 24 hours will pass  ken won't be viable     nobody gets anything   okay   let's do that   you honestly never thought about it in all those years  leaving him   nothing's perfect   but i made my peace   yeah  i did  too   at least i thought i did   i yelled at him so much     last time i saw him   god   maria    at some point  you have to let him go   oh  okay   oh  it's a e on  baby   you want to come hold your granddaughter   welcome  little girl   she looks just like lucy     she's in v tach    i'm on it   i've gotta close  if she has any chance  i have to close   charging to 200  clear     again  300    the paramedics are here   they're bringing in a stretcher     no    clear   we've got an open body cavity in a barely sterile environment   do not let them cross the threshold until i say so     understand    got it     how are you doing there  pete    i'm kicking ass and taking names  you   ass kicking and name taking are on my r sum    charging to 360  clear   start her on a lidocaine drip  2 migs per minute    did i have the baby   yes  you did   is my dad    is he mad   no  your dad is not mad at you   thank you     for     thank you   well  that was     pretty cool   oh   dell   good work in there   i didn't come down here because you kissed me     okay    i didn't     okay    i need you to say it   you did not move down here because i kissed you   you so moved down here because i kissed you   i heard that   uh  maria's gonna let leslie have it   we can do the extraction on ken   what'd you say   just that it was time     to let him go   good   that's  uh  that's good   okay   oh  and my book     was brilliant   his name was will   hey  paul  do you think you could clear out this area   just for a little while    for jenny   yeah  i could do that for jenny   hey  jenny   this is    this is dr  freedman   he's a    he's a pediatrician   and he's my friend   hi   i have will's file here   it says he was suffering from double vision when you brought him in   he was 10  diagnosed with a brain em glioma   is that something they could've caught earlier   no  they got it early   but because of the location of the tumor in the brain   it was inoperable   so will started chemo and radiation   and the tumor responded at first   but then    will developed kidney failure   well  that happens with chemo a lot   at that point  you and your husband decided to stop treatment   is that right  jenny    making that choice     a lot of people aren't strong enough to do that
