wasn't sure what was going on   did you tell them   tell them   did you tell your parents about    you know   no   why not   because i figure i have two options    one  to tell them and ruin the rest of my life   the other  to pretend like it never happened    so i'm going with  never happened    well  amy  unfortunately  it did happen     and you're gonna have to     never happened   amy     never happened   people know   ok  people only know that amy had sex with ricky    sync                 the secret life of the american teenager season 01 ep 02       what happened at the party after the game   oh  right   you were there   yeah  i was there   what happened   adrian  the majorette  was supposed to meet me there   then i find out she's kissing some cheerleader's boyfriend in front of everyone   what cheerleader   grace   oh  right   that cheerleader   yeah  yeah  i heard   you know grace's mom is my dad's ex wife   oh  no kidding   you two don't look anything alike   it was a joke  like i thought you were sisters or something   you're not sisters   no  we're not related   yeah  i get that   anyway  i can't believe that happened   i mean  not that we were in a relationship   we're just friends  adrian and me  but still   everything's more complicated than it seems   yeah  i guess   but i'm not exactly the kind of guy who gets cheated on   you know   no  no  i don't know   so  do you wanna do something tonight   do something   don't get excited   i meant do something  like go somewhere and talk   you and i are friends  too  right   actually  i'm seeing someone   who are you seeing   is it that little geek who wants to be me   why do that when you could be out with the real thing   as a friend  of course   of course   thank you for offering  ricky  but i'm really not interested   whoa  who are you not to be interested in me   rejected again   maybe you should consider going for someone more like yourself   oh  sooner or later  you know you're gonna forgive me  so come on   come over tonight and let me apologize to you in person   i can't  i have things to do   you can't be serious   you can't be interested in that child   you know  some girls do it without broadcasting it to the whole school   some girls are more discreet about their sex life than you are   some girls have class   and you're referring to that little french horn player  who looks like she's 12 and has never been kissed   i don't think she has a sex life   she has nothing to be discreet about   and i don't know if she has class   she's just a band geek   wait  do you know something   am i wrong   is she not just a band geek   you cannot pretend like this isn't happening   yes  i can   it's better than the plan you two came uwith   here he comes   maybe you should just tell him   you guys can tell your parents together   no  don't even think about doing that   just talk to your parents first   yeah   bye  girls  i wanna talk to your friend alone   you havin' some sort of memory problem   can't remember the locker combination   can't remember what happened just six weeks   a couple of months ago   nothing happened   ok  it wasn't that great  but you were a little nervous   and that's understandable   it'll get better  it's ok   i told you  i'm seeing someone   grace  are you ok   i just don't feel that well   you were fine this morning   no  i wasn't fine   i thought i could get through this  but i can't   i feel completely humiliated   please  mom  please  can you just take me home   don't you have a test today   algebra   it was first period  i aced it   i'm sure you did   because you are a very smart young woman   maybe with schoolwork   i'm not that smart when it comes to men obviously   grace     i know that you're smart enough to realize  that jack not the guy for you   no  i'm not   that's just the thing   i still love him  and i hate her   i know i'm not supposed to hate anyone  but i hate her   you know     a lot of women react to men cheating like that   the guy cheats  and instead of blaming him  they blame her   they forgive him and never her   her after her after her   well  he didn't cheat on me  exactly   he just kissed her in front of the whole school   or let her kiss him   i mean  what guy wouldn't  you've seen her   grace     maybe it's not his fault  and maybe it's not even her fault   maybe it's my fault   because you won't have sex with him   i mean  do you think that gives him reason to kiss someone else   hey  man  i only scored 80 on my paper you wrote   i know   so   i took your abilities into account  and decided to dumb down the essay a little   i'm lookin' for believability here  man   or else i'm out of business   for you   great  thanks  man   idiot   do you think they were doing anything more than kissing   the point is jack is not good enough for you   he can't be trusted  ok   hey  i heard you were sick  are you ok   you gonna go home   hi  mrs  bowman   she's just fine  jack   we forgot about a dental appointment   you know  just a little teeth cleaning   you know how important it is to have clean teeth   we should go   yeah  i gotta go  too   can you believe that   yes  honey  actually  i can  because he's a careless guy   and you don't need a careless guy  ok   let's go get a cup of coffee   and then i'll bring you back for cheer practice   what did you tell the nurse was wrong with you   i didn't have to tell her anything   everyone just heard  even her   so iust sa i wanted to go home   ok   he is kind of careless   kind of   now just rember  honey  you should neither judge him  nor feel sorry for him  'k   just let this one go   let's go   advertising   what   oh  lord   i don't know what the lord has to do with your zipper   but you're welcome   hey  wait up   where's your girlfriend   i don't have a girlfriend  not yet  anyway   maybe if you wanted to apologize     i thought about it   but i really don't owe you an apology for anything   you know  since we're not even gng out or anything   we're just friends   i can do anything i want   still  you offered to apologize   it was a one time only offer   you shouldn't have stood me up   so were you with that amy girl  the one in the band   i didn't stand you up  you stood me up   or you were late  anyway  and  no  i was not with amy   i was only with her the one time   i don't believe you   i'm telling you the truth   so where were you that night   i was not with amy   what are you  my wife  i answer to you now   i was at home with my foster parents   i couldn't get out of the house   foster parents are twice as tough as real parents   believe me  i know   i've bounced from one foster home to another   jack probably thinks he's going to hell now   yeah  well  it's not like i made jack do something he didn't wanna do   no  it's like   it's like you took advantage of him   what went on with you two before that kiss   something   what  i answer to you now   he told the guys in the locker room   they told their girlfriends   one of them already told me   i don't really care   what kind of guy brags about this stuff   uh  you told me about amy juergens   yeah   nice touch   the gloves   he has pinkeye   your butler insisted on it   and if he didn't insist   we'd all have pinkeye   i see   anyway  so     you take the sour cream and onion chip   you dip it in the plain sour cream    and it tastes just like onion dip   it's delicious  try it   i think it's just that chips and dip taste better  when they're served out of silver bowls   i've never had a chip that wasn't straight out of the bag   my dad thinks we should use all the silver stuff we have    even if we don't know what it's for   i agree with your dad  we should   don't do that   i'll smack you   oh  he's just reminding you that we haven't used  any of the china or silver or anything  since my mom died   yeah  i know that  henry   i thought that maybe you forgot   it's healthy   it's healthy to move on  ben   it's been a long time   five years is a long time   yeah  it is   believe me  it feels longer than five years   time passes real slow when you're a kid   it's starting to speed up a little  though   guess i'm getting older  maturing   maybe i'll get married soon   have a kid  start a little family band   what   i think you're too young to be having those thoughts   you can't just fall in love with the first girl you go out with  and marry her   and have a family band with her   why not  isn't that what you're supposed to do   more than half of all marriages end in divorce   the younger you are when you get married    the more likely you are to get divorced   my dad married the first girl he ever dated  they were 18   that's different  that was in the '80s   everyone was coked out and disco dancing   no one really knew what they were doing   my parents never did coke   disco  yeah   regardless  my point is  you should see other girls   i just started seeing this one   the one that you picked out for me   she's perfect   i love her   something's going on   what's going on   all right  look  i'm a straight shooter   so    let me just tell you   you've got competion   ha  what  that total loser ricky   tricky ricky   he's no competition   they slept together   what   what   no   my little amy would never    wait  she slept with him   slept  as in had sex   that's what i heard   i don't care   yeah  you do  i know you   you don't know me if you think that would stop me  from marrying my amy and starting a band with her   who told you this   it's all over school   oh  and that makes it true   what percentage of gossip is true   i don't know   well  i know it's not 100    that guy  ricky is probably telling people he slept with her  hoping it'd get back to me   he's totally jealous of me   ok  well  maybe there's a reason he's jealous of you   like maybe they did sleep together   at band camp   now you've got details   that's everything i know   i'm gonna call her and ask her   not a bad idea   you two are idiots   i bet it's just a rumor   i bet it's not   i hope i'm wrong  20   you're on   hey  how are ya   um  i'm fine   you sure   yeah  i'm sure   i hope you know what you're doin'   am i doing something wrong  in band practice   did i get in your way or something   no  you didn't get in my way   look  if you're interested in ricky    i won't go out with him  i'll back off   you know  i'm really not into stealing anyone's boyfriend   i wasn't interested in taking jack away from grace   he came to me   i'm no no no  i'm not interested in ricky   all right   that's not what i heard  but     no  i heard that you were     interested in him before i was  so     no   hi  amy  it's me   ben   hi   oh  i already said that   um  anyway  uh  i was wondering     there's this rumor going around school  that  uh  you and ricky dated this summer or something   uh  not that it makes any difference   i  i was just wondering   is that true   ok  you know what   i have no way of calling back this message   which i wish i'd never sent   it doesn't matter   i don't care   and it's none of my business  none of my business at all   it's your business   and our business started the day that we met   ok  talk to you later   i hope   if i don't hear back from you  i'll call again   and i if you don't answer  i'll see you tomorrow at school   ok   uh  and again  i  i don't even know why i asked   ok  bye   oh  call me   please   you were right   this was a really bad idea   we have to go now   idiot   at least i didn't say she slept with him   i said she dated him   at least   let's go already   hi   amy  it's me   ben   hi  oh  i already said that   um  anyway  uh  i was wondering   there's this rumor going around school  that you and ricky     never happened   hey  hey  watch it   that's my livelihood   are you telling people that we did something   what  what's goin' on   are you   something  am i telling people we did something   no  i'm not   are you telling people we did something   no   really   you didn't tell your two girlfriends   and your two girlfriends didn't tell anyone   madison says she's been trying to call you on your cell phone   i'm trying to study   don't just barge in to my room like that  ok   i have the right to privacy   man  you're such a dork   and what do you need all the privacy for  anyway   i mean  what  are you writing little secret love poems to your boyfriend or something   hello   it's the other one  the snob   i can't talk   m  my parents are making me study   just stop c calling me   well  what is this   you're lying   you don't lie   you never lie   when you do  your face turns bright red   you get little beads of sweat on your forehead   and if it's a really big lie  you start stuttering again   so    you're lying   why would you be lying to your two bffs  anyway   i'm just t trying study  ok   yeah  ok   hey  whatever happened to that ben guy   oh  wait  is the fight about ben   what  are they  like  jealous or something   it's not about anything  all right   we're not even having a fight  and i'm not stuttering   you're sweating   b  bye   hey  hey  hey  what do you think  hon   this is a recliner   rocks  reclines   put some wheels on it   now it goes back and forth   i think i invented something   is that why you're late   no  i  um   was gonna close at six   but a couple of chicks came into the store   i couldn't get rid of 'em   they just bought a house   in this market  so you know they got plenty of dough   do we   do we what   have plenty of dough   why   i was just wondering   don't wonder  it's a waste of time   i think worry is a waste of time   i don't know about wonder   you may be right   i wonder if there's something for me to eat in here   george  i want to go to see our accountant   i want to make sure we have enough put away    for amy and ashley to go to college   ashley  we'll be lucky if she goes to high school   is that an option   i don't have to go to high school   of course you have to go to high school   and college   why don't you go make that sandwich   and get that hybrid out of here  please   you're worried about money  and i'm wheelin' out our nest egg   lotta phone calls tonight   yeah   what about home schooling   sure   just you and me and a bunch of schoolbooks for eight hours   every day  for four years   maybe i could go to school in europe   yeah  let's see how well that chair does   so  the phone calls   everything ok with amy  madison and lauren   i don't know   was everything ok with larry  curly and moe   yeah  just    hi  dr  bowman   i was wondering if i might speak with grace   speak with grace about what  exactly   i just wanna talk to her   yeah   you called her cell phone  you called the house   you even resorted to calling her brother   she doesn't wanna talk to you  jack   why don't you buy a vowel  go home   i have to talk to her   i can't not talk to her   i    i love her   i made a mistake  but i do love her   didn't you ever make a mistake   excuse me   look  i promise  it won't happen again   oh  no  no  jack  i think it will happen again   it was just a kiss   really            my wife seems to think that   and my daughter seems to think that   but i'm not buying it  jack     aren't we all christians here   aren't you supposed to forgive     all i'm askin' for is a little forgiveness   all right   and exactly what will you be asking for after you get your forgiveness  jack   look   do yourself a very big favor  ok   go home before i pummel you   i thought you were a christian   that's right  i'm a christian   so first  i will smite you   then i will pummel you   go home   smite   i heard that   was that jack     yeah    what did he want     he said he wanted forgiveness     but i have a feeling what he really wanted was you   really   yes  really  and i'm not saying that in a good way  gracie   is that why you gave me this ring  you and mom   because you don't trust me   no  sweetheart  we trust you     we don't trust jack or any other boy you might wanna date   because   because they're teenage guys in high school     teenage guys in high school are only interested in one thing  sweetheart   and that's sex   i think that's unfair     ok    ok  what   it's ok that you think my assessment of the situation is unfair   i think i know a little bit more about this than you do  but      then again  you think you know more about everything      because you're a doctor   yes  i am a doctor    who happened to once be a teenage boy in high school   so  yeah  i do think i know a little more about this than you     listen  i realize you're upset   but do not talk to me that way   i think it would be wise of you to stay away from jack altogether   and if i don't wanna stay away from jack   i suppose your mother and i will have to re evaluate  whether or not we think you're old enough to make your own decisions   i'm almost 16  dad   i know that you're almost 16 years old   i was there   i'm older than you  i'm always gonna be older than you     because of that  i'm gonna know a little bit more than you   whether you're 16 or 60   that's just how it works   i'm at a loss here   i can't figure out why in the world you would even wanna see jack again   especially considering the pain and suffering he put you through this week   i think you ought to go upstairs and think about that   and while you're at it   think about why in the world you would wanna put yourself  through any more public humiliation at school   then you and i can talk about it   tomorrow  but please     don't put me in the position to have to make up your mind for you  simply because you don't think enough of yourself   sweetheart  do you know the number one killer of women young and old     that hpv thing   no  it's not that hpv thing   it's low self esteem     and those teenage boys out there know that   and they use it against you and for them   so you  you  just   you     you beware  young lady   grace   i think in all of that parental wisdom   i might've forgotten to tell you how much i love you   i love you so much   good night     i love you  too   but i love jack  too   you don't have to go   my mom's not coming home   she's a flight attendant   so she's in  like  denver or somewhere   fosters  rember     i have to go  it's a law or something   but that was great   well  do you want some pizza or something   no  thanks  anyway   come on  can't you just stay a little while   i can't  really  i'm gonna have to explain where i was  as it is   you're beautiful  you know that   i'll call you later  ok   yeah  if you want   if i want  of course i want   good night   please  please stay   i hate being here by myself   i can't   i'd like to  but i can't  i'm sorry     all right  go    don't do that   don't make me feel bad for doing what i'm supposed to do   if i don't go home   my fosters will report me to social services   and i'll be kicked back into the system   i'll have to change schools   and we'll never see each other again   because i'll be in juvie or something   is that true   yes  it's true   ok  but call me   we can talk on the phone all night   yeah  i'll call ya  of course i'll call ya   bye   bye   hello   hi   hi   i left you a message before  just ignore it   so     what are you doing this weekend   do you wanna go to the museum on saturday   they're have a showing of the history of musical instruments   i bet my cymbals beat your french horn on the timeline  huh   where did you hear that   am i wrong   the cymbals came after the french horn   no  who told you i had anything to do with that creep   what  oh  no one   ok  someone had to have told you   is it all around school or something   no  someone had just pointed out to me that maybe this guy    mickey  dickie  ricky  whatever    was jealous for a reason   a reason like i did something with him   what  no  ah   i didn't say that  i said dated   please  please  let's just forget it   i don't care  whatever it is   i mean  i care about you   so whatever you did or didn't do   it doesn't matter   because you're amy juergens   the girl that i love   we had one date   one date and a thousand phone calls   and sure  maybe it's a little early for me to proclaim my love for you   but i plead special circumstances   ok  well     don't feel obligated to reciprocate   it's totally not necessary   ok   i love you  too     you do    yeah   that's great  you know   now we can start saying it all the time   well  maybe not all the time   but we can say it when we hang up   you know  like grownups  like a real couple   good night  amy   i love you   good night  ben   i love you  too   good morning  counselor   get outta my chair   oh  sorry   i just grew tired of waiting  and thought perhaps i could get a different perspective  if i looked at things from your side   yeah  move   don't you recognize a cry for help when you see one   it's 7 30 in the morning   i haven't had my first cup of coffee yet   i don't recognize anyone or anything   what kind of guy doesn't stop in  for a nonfat soy latte on his way to work   kind of guy that refuses to spend five bucks on a cup of coffee  when he's trying to survive off a teacher's salary   may i suggest buying a coffee pot   oh  perhaps a french press   may i suggest you tell me what help you need  so i can go down to the teachers' lounge   grab a free cup of coffee i don't have to make myself   oh  sure  or i could wait  if you wanna run down there   tempting  but then i'd be leaving you in here alone   come on  what is it   what's the problem  music man   i think you know what my problem is   maybe   people are talking about my woman   they're saying she was cavorting with the drummer at band camp one summer's eve   i heard that   but i doubt it   yeah  me too  so i asked her   what did you do that for   i don't know   i thought she'd deny it   she didn't deny it   not exactly     she probably didn't feel it deserved a denial   i felt so horrible about asking her that i told her i love her   it's a little early for that  don't you think   yeah   no   i do love her  i think   it just bothers me a teeny tiny little bit that maybe  just maybe   there was a possibility that something might've happened  between her and this ricky guy   ok  here's the thing    and this is way outside the realm of things  we're supposed to be talking about as counselor and student    but whatever a woman does before she meets you is none of your business   yeah  i know  i even told her that   but then i thought    if she had killed someone  i'd wanna know about it      she didn't kill anyone   i wish she had killed someone   that i would admire  if it was someone horrible  like hitler   she didn't kill hitler or anyone like hitler   your point being   my point being that you can only deal with what is   and what is is that you love this girl   and you don't know for sure that she slept with ricky   and even if she did   she probably feels shame and embarrassment  and wishes she never had   because now she's found somebody that actually cares about her   yeah   see  i knew you'd know just what to say   thank you   hey  and all that without the caffeine   maybe you oughta kick that addiction   i don't believe in addiction   i believe in willpower  plain old fashioned willpower   if i wanted to give it up  i'd give it up   i don't wanna give it up   interesting   i'm sure  see ya   thanks  i owe you   amy   leave me alone   we're your best friends     were your parents really making you study   or did you have  like  a fight or something   i didn't wanna talk to you   well  that's rude   why not   what  just telling the whole school i had sex with ricky     no    no     he says you did   ricky says we told people the two of you had sex     that's ridiculous  why would we do that     why would we want people to know that   i mean  that's insane   i mean  who gossips about     sex   ricky told you that we were telling people that   wait  were you puking in there   yeah  that's what he implied   he is so disgusting   you know  i hate it when people blame     other people for     for other things and try and tear friends apart   yeah  i mean   it was probably him who was saying that you two had sex   i mean  you know how he is   he wants everyone to think he's  like  the big sex    guy   and he's just a big liar   so you guys didn't say anything   i think you know us a little better than that   i'm sorry   you're right  i don't know what i was thinking   you guys are my best friends  and     he's totally the type of guy that would do something like that   you know  he better stop   he better stop right now or     or my boyfriend's gonna have a word with him   boyfriend  ben's officially your boyfriend now   yeah  heh heh  last night  he told me that he loves me   really   great   anyways  gotta get this back to the band room and then go find ben   bye   ok  you didn't say anything to anyone about her and ricky  did you   i mean  other than ben's best friends   wait   ok  that was me   but you didn't say anything to anyone else  right   no  did you     well     not about the baby   neither did i   yeah  ok   yeah   hey  you   i can't believe you told him   i didn't tell him anything   like you wouldn't tell amy if you knew something about ben like that   well  do you know anything about ben like that   oh  like ben got laid   it doesn't make any difference  ok   ben apparently doesn't care  if amy had some one night fling with the drummer boy   he's above all that   as long as it wasn't more than that   it wasn't more than that   you think it was more than that   what could be more than that   and if it was more than that  we don't wanna know   and we don't want ben to know   right  ignorance is bliss   sorry   by the time i got home last night   my battery was dead on my cell phone   yeah   and my dog ate my homework   oh  come on  you're not mad at me   yeah  i am mad at you   made you lunch   you made me lunch     a sandwich  a piece of ham between two slices of bread   it's nothin'   and chips   you think a ham sandwich and a bag of chips  is going to make up for a big fat lie  about not calling me after sleeping with me   i didn't wanna be on the phone all night   hey  look who's capable of being honest   i'm capable of a lot of things   even having a girlfriend   jack  jack   hi   hi   i think we should talk   i came by your house last night   yeah  i know   your dad really hates me   no  he doesn't   and i don't  either   i don't hate you   guess that's a start   my dad doesn't think we should be going out with each other   and  well  maybe he's right   maybe he's wrong   i made a mistake   if god can forgive me  why can't you   i can  if it was just a kiss  i can   what did you think it was   i don't know  was it anything more than a kiss   did you do anything else with her     like what    i don't know   did you have sex with her   what  no   oral sex   grace    don't let your imagination run wild   it happened right after we talked about that   come on  i don't even know her   you think i'd let her do something like that   don't you think more of me than that   all right   i guess i believe you   but still  you embarrassed me in front of the whole school   if i didn't have such high self esteem   we wouldn't be having this conversation now       i'm really sorry     can we go out tonight   go out  no   why not   we can't just go out  i have to talk to my parents   i don't know if they'll let me go out with you tonight or any night   can i call you  are you gonna take my calls now     i guess    you guess     i have to talk to my parents      talk to your parents   i will   but i think they're gonna need a little more time   and so do i   how much time   you cheated on me   i apologized for that   are you gonn make me keep apologizing our entire lives together  because i was stupid and kissed another girl   maybe   i was weak   i was tempted  i gave in   but grace  i swear  that's never gonna happen again   and if it did  i would     i don't know  i would     i would smite myself   yeah  your dad said he was gonna smite me   that's what he said   let's just leave my dad out of this   love to   look  what happened is never gonna happen again   i wanna believe that  but i don't know if i do   i think you're kind of obsessed with sex   since when   since i put this ring on my finger  and promised i wouldn't have sex until i get married     it did kind of upset me     i wasn't even part of the decision   it's my decision   before i talk my parents into letting us see each other again   you have to promise me you will never pressure me into having sex with you   not that you could   i respect myself  and i expect you to respect me   all right  i respect you   just promise me you're not gonna make me wait ten years or something   there's not a time limit  jack   i can't make you that promise   all i can promise is that i'm willing to go back out with you  with the aforementioned conditions   and if you get permission from your parents   yes  if i get permission   then get permission   hi   hi   i was looking for you   i was looking for you  too     about last night      about last night     yeah  i hope i didn't pressure you into saying something you didn't mean   i know it's early for me to bringing up the  l  word   you weren't gonna say that   no  um     i was thinking that maybe we should talk about  you know   what you heard about me  if you want to   what  the thing with the drummer   forget about it   really  it's none of my business       i don't wanna know about any other guy that's ever been in your life   i     i don't think i could take it   so as far as me telling you what i told you     not too early   heh  i don't know  i     i've never had a boyfriend  ever   well  i've never had a girlfriend  ever   in case you were wondering about my past   oh  i wasn't  but    where's the french horn   oh  i left it in the band room     i've been thinking about getting a tutor    so i can get in the band quicker     not that i'm jealous of anyone in the band  i just     love me   yeah   welcome to
