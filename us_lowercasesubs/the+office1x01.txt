grasshopper   actually you call me in here  but yeah   all right  well let me show you how it s done   yes  i liked to speak to your office manager please   yes hello this is michael scott  i am the regional manager  of dundler mifflin paper products   just wanted to talk to you manager on manager   all right done deal  thank you very much sir   you re a gentleman in the scolar   oh i m sorry  ok  i m sorry  my mistake   that was a woman i was talking to    she had a very low voice   probably a smoker   so so that s the way it s done   i ve been in dundler mifflin for twelve years   the last four as regional manager  if you want to come through here   so we have the entire floor   so this is my kingdom  as far as the eye can see   ah this is our receptionist pam   pam  pam pam  pam beesly   pam has been with us for   for ever  right pam   well  i don t know   if you think she s cute now  you should have seen her a couple of years ago   what   any messages   yeah  just a fax  pam this is from corporate   how many times have i told you that there s  a special filing cabinet for things from corporate   you haven t told me   it s called the wastepaper basket   look at that    look at that face   people say i m the best boss   they go   god we've never worked in a place like this before   you re hilarious  and you get the best out of us    i think that pretty much sums it up  i found it at spencer gifts   my job is to speak to clients  on the phone about quantities  and type of copier paper   you know  whether we can supply to them  whether they can pay for it and     i m boring myself just talking about this   he still loves that after seven years   what   nothing  ok  all right  see you later  all right  take care   back to work   corporate really doesn t interfere with me at all  jan levinson gould  jan  hello   i call her hillary rodham clinton  right   not to her face because   not because i m scared of her  because i m not  but     yeah   all right  was it anything you wanted to add to the agenda   me no get an agenda   i m sorry  what   i didn t get any agenda   oh i faxed one overdue this morning   really  cause i didn t did we get a fax this morning   yeah  the one   why isn t it in my hand   because a company runs on efficiency of communication  right   so what s the problem pam  why i didn t get it   you put it in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet   yeah  that was a joke  that was actually my brother's   it was supposed to be with bills and doesn t work great with faxes   do you want to look at mine   yeah  thank you   ok since the last meeting  alan and the board have decided  that we can t justify scranton branch and the stafford branch  oh ok   no  michael don t panic  no no no no this is good  this is fine  michael listen  don t panic  we haven t made any decisions yet   i ve spoken to joshua in stanford i ve told him the same as you  and it s up to either you or him to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other  ok no problem  this does however mean that there is going to be downsizing  me no wanna hear that jan   because downsizing is a bitch   it is a real bitch   and i wouldn t wish that on joshua s men   i certainly wouldn t wish it on my men   or women present company excluded   sorry   is josh concerned about downsizing himself   not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing   question  how long do we have to    oh  todd paker  terrific rept  do you mind if i take it   no  go ahead  pac man   hey  big queen  oh  that s not appropriate  hey  coming in today   i don t know what you mean  look  i demanded ask her one question  does the corporate master rape  oh my god   that's so horrifying  horrible  horrible person   so do you think we can keep a lid on this for now i don t want to worry people unnecessarily   no  absolutely  under this regime  it will not leave this office   so what is downsizing actually mean   well  you guys gotta update your resume  just like i m doing   i bet it s gonna be me  probably   yeah  it ll be you  i have an important question for you   yes  are you going to engelate  on sunday   yeah  stop  that s ridiculous   am i gonna tell them  no i m not going to tell them  i don t see the point of that   as a doctor you would not tell a patient if they had cancer   this is mister scott   ryan howard from the temp agency   set me down to start today  howard  like moe howard  three stooges   right here  my vibe  oh pam  that s a guy thing pam   i m sort of a student in comedy  i m hitler  adolph hitler  i don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go   because then i might  it s just  i don't think it's many girls dream to be a receptionist   i like to do illustrations   mostly water color  a few oil pencil   jim thinks they re good   dundler mifflin this is pam   sure  mr  davis  let me call you right back   yeah  some just came up  two minutes  thank you very much   dwight  what are you doing     what     what are you doing   just clearing my desk  i can t concentrate    it's not on your desk     it s overlapping   it's all coming over the edge   one word  two syllables   demarcation     you can't do that     why not   safety violation  i could fall and pierce  and organ   we'll see  this is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me   downsizing   i have no problem with that  i have been recommending downsizing since halpert got here  even brought it up on my interview   i say  bring it on   you just still have messages for yesterday  relax everything is under control  yeah  yeah  yeah oh that s important  right   oh  this is so important  i should run to answer it   what   come on  six million dollars man  steve austin   actually that would be a good salary for me don t you think  six million dollars   memo to jan  i deserve a raise  don t we all   i m sorry   there s nothing   if you are unhappy with your compensation  maybe you should take it up with hr   ok  not today  ok  pam just  be professional   i think i m a role model here  i think i garner other people respect   attention on dundler mifflin employees  please we have a meeting in the conference room asap  people i respect  heros of mine  would be bob hope   abraham lincoln  definitely   bono   and probably god be the fourth one   and i just think all those people really helped the world  in so many ways   that it s  it s really beyond words   it s really uncalculable   now  i know there s some rumors out there  and i just kind want to see    i m assistant regional manager  i should know first   assistant to the regional manager   ok  can you just tell me please   just a whisper in my ear   i m about to tell everybody   i'm just about to tell exeryone  please  ok   do you want me to tell them   you don t know what it is   can you tell them  with my permission   i don t need your     permission granted  go ahead  corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me   and jan is thinking about downsizing either the stanford branch or this branch   i heard they might be closing this branch down   that's just     that's just the rumor going around this is my first day i don t really know   yeah  but michael what if they downsize here   not gonna happen  it could be out of your hands  michael  it won't be out of my hands  stanley  ok   i promise you that   can you promise that   on his mother's grave   well yeah it is a promise  and frankly i m a little bit insulted that you have to keep asking about it   it s just that we need to know  hold on a second  i think pam wanted to say something  pam   you had a look that you wanted to ask a question  just then   i was in the meeting with jan and she did said that it could be this branch that gets the axe   are you sure about that   pam  maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings   pam  information is power   so you can't say for sure whether it's gotta to be us or them   no no  no stanley  no you did not see me in there with her   i said  if corporate wants to come in here  and interfere then they re gonna have to go through me  right   you know  you can go a mess with josh s people   but i m the head of this family   and you ain t gonna be messing with my children   if i left  what would i do with all this useless information in my head   you
