   1     falling skies 1x01     live and learn original air date on june 19  2011     sync  corrected by elderman     girl  i was in school when the ships came    they were really big   and they said that we weren't gonna attack them  with the nuclear bombs  because they might have wanted to be friends   but they didn't want to be friends   not at all    and then there was a bright light  that makes  like  all electronics stop working   computers   radios  satellites   cars  tvs   everything   they blew up army bases   ships  the navy  submarines   and all the soldiers are gone   boy  now moms and dads have to fight   after that  they blew up all the capitals   new york  washington  d c   paris    to all the major cities   then they came   boy  there were millions of them   trillions    everywhere   we call them skitters and mechs    they killed grown ups  and they catch kids   they put on harness things   they put it on kids and control them    they say it hurts a lot   my parents went out to get some help one day    and i know they're gone  they're dead   anne  listen  it's okay to cry   drawing and talking about it can make you feel better   matt  what have you drawn here   matt  my mom   she was going to get food once and never came back   and then we found her   she was dead   and then dad said we had to leave our house   and ben was over at nick's house   and we think they might have got him   but we're not for sure   and this drawing   that's with me and dad and hal   it's all right   you and your dad and hal are okay   well  they were okay this morning   but i don't know about now   they're fighting     go   go  take the gas   bryan  mechs  stay down    aah   get the food     aah   leave it   here they come  cover them   short bursts  short bursts   ugh   aah   get up     hal  in here   ugh   skitters       aah       that's jerrod's cousin   no  no  don't   no  no  no  no  no  no   shh  shh  shh     that's jerrod's cousin     come on  come on   get up   whoa  whoa  whoa   mechs    front   the colton street barricade's down  skitters  too   they're up to the common  both barricades there are gone   we're falling back  back bay is lost   they take back bay  they take the city   no kidding  porter's calling us in   let's go       south boston  south boston  south boston   quiet   they got south boston  skitters and mechs   rear guard  come on   we holding   who'd we lose   captain jameson  jerrod's cousin   and a bunch of guys i didn't know   jameson's dead  who's gonna command the 2nd     excuse me   you're back from work early   tough day at the office   we lost the widget account   oh  rats   bad   yeah  they're up to back bay   any food   price of tuna's gone up   wait   matt drew these   he's doing much better    drew his whole family   that does not look like me   tom  tom   porter wants to see you   weaver  back bay was lost   they let go in south boston    one of the big ones   porter  i told reed small arms only  he had those at4s   i guess he used them and pissed them off   come on in  tom   gents  the city's lost  so we're on the move   we're gonna split up  go to ground   where we can hide and scavenge   we can't leave the city   they've got prisoners  what about the harnessed kids   tom  you're not the only guy with a kid that's m i a   we're all in this together   and you've got two other sons to worry about   okay  well  i have to agree with him there   we can't leave the city   we've got no choice   we picked this area clean of weapons and food   and those skitter aerial sensors  are beginning to pick up units of 500  600 humans   well  i'll tell you what we need to do   we need to stay here  and we need to fight   listen to me  weaver   we are splitting up into units of 300      i've already sent out nine of these units   you're the last three   anderson  i want you to take the 10th massachusetts  north along the shore till you get to marblehead   sam  you got jeffries as your second in command   we'll move northwest along route 3 till you get to revere   weaver   i'm giving you the 2nd massachusetts  to replace jameson   i'm also giving you tom as your second in command   you move west  go to ground somewhere around acton   what do we do when they start picking up groups of 300   then we break up into smaller units and we continue  weaver   till it's armies of one and the  start picking us off individually   is that how we do it   listen  if you've got a better idea   i'd damn sure like to hear it  oh  i have a better idea   we got a chance right now   that's what i'm trying to tell you   now  i don't know how many skitters and mechs the bastards left   but it's a hell of a lot less than it was  and a hell of a lot less than it'll be  when the mother ships come back  and they will   we cannot fight these things unless we know how   i know how  no  you don't   nobody knows how  and that's the problem   that's the reason we're gonna split up  we're gonna run   we're gonna hide  and we're gonna survive   now  all the food stores have been marked on your maps   as of last week's recon  they were all intact and secure   i'm gonna have the med and science people with me   they're still working on the harness situation   lost two more kids this morning  trying to get the damn things off   now  that's it   any questions   no  sir   get back to your people  we move out in the morning   i'll let you know the exact time   jim  i think you're making a mistake  to give weaver noncombatants    i do     listen  it had to be weaver   he's got eight years active army   he's got six years reserve   and i saw him operate in desert storm   you  on the other hand  professor mason   have read a lot of books   hey  i'm not asking   now  i grant you that a great deal of those books  were military history  but i had to go with weaver   understood   there's a reason why you are his second in command   you do whatever you've got to do  to defend those civilians   i understand   good   and good luck   yeah   it's not over  tom   anthony  okay  so  these guys  from the 5th mass  okay  down in dorchester     uh  out of ammo   except for  what  these two bullets  in a clip in an old  45 automatic   click  yeah  yeah  yeah  right   what then  yeah  come on  what happened   anthony  okay  so  the guy   you know  he stands there like bait  right   skitter moved in   right  other guy from behind the dumpster     boom  boom   head shot  point blank range   you're dead  dead    that's one way to do it   i'd do it like that   man  you would wet yourself   fine  long as i get that head shot in   all right  man  all right  man     what are you looking at   that thing hasn't moved since yesterday   i was just wondering how to get at it   you know  find my way inside  head upstairs   find the lizard in charge  and just kick some alien ass   personally  i like the idea  of seven or eight truckloads of c 4  driven in simultaneously from different directions  mm hmm   maybe a couple coming in on boats across the harbor   boom  yeah   how do the drivers get out of there   tom  no  no  no  no   you got it all wrong   outside of that thing's gonna be like a fortress   you need to get inside    a trojan horse   or  like the world war i sappers   tunnel underneath it   plant the biggest pile of tnt you've ever seen  right under the center of it   or like the romans at pontus  when they were     whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  there you go  professor   professor kick ass   yeah  well  tomorrow  we kick ass     or maybe the day after tomorrow   all right  for now   let's get that  50 squared away  get some sleep   we move out in the morning   think that'd work    heading underground   oh  yeah  yeah  yeah  well  it has throughout history   alexander leading the macedonians   what   i don't know   you think  dad   maybe you could  uh  ease up on the history lessons     with the guys around  at least   got it   all right    hal  sure  the 250's faster  but it's just lousy off road   yeah   little 175's better for scouting   but it's so damn loud   well  scott thinks he can rig up some sort of muffler for it   and maybe the    thought you might be hungry   yeah  i was worried about you   oh  really wasn't that bad   glad you're okay   yeah     i'm glad you're okay    how long   just finishing up   we got most of the stretcher cases off already   you're good   for a pediatrician   for any doctor    practice makes perfect   there is a silver lining in all of this   oh  yeah   if this hadn't happened   i'd be dealing with flu shots and neurotic mothers   i'd be grading midterms     or at least staring at a stack of blue books   trying to figure out how to avoid them   hey  things could be worse   so  what are we doing  running  regrouping   i just hope porter knows what he's doing   retreat  regroup  return     revenge   forget about those shopsmarts   they're too close in    traps for sure   our best bet is that sundash in belmont   yeah  i agree   you don't have to agree  you just need to listen   those are my orders  yes  sir       okay  try it again   you gonna get it going   almost there  i just need to fix the     you got 10 minutes   i hated carburetors before electronic fuel injection   and i hate carburetors now  anne  uncle scott   we've got 200 pounds of medical supplies   into the car or into backpacks   in the car  i'll get it going   backpacks  backpacks   all right  come on  try it again     why are we leaving   going someplace better   but tonight's the 8th  it's my party   oh  sure thing  your highness   hey  you had a birthday party  too   and it was after they came   we'll try to do a little something when we get settled   we're doing the best that we can   hey   give

humans     i wish more food    dad   every food store and cache  between here and acton's picked clean   too many of us   if it was just the fighters   we could stretch our provisions   well  it's not  and we need food   so it's one of the shopsmarts  then     either the store in west newton  or the distribution center in watertown   we can't go back  not with this group     too many  too slow   maybe half the vehicles  half the fighters go back   get the food  and then they catch up    yeah  that sounds great   who's gonna lead them    you   yes   you want to go back   yes   all right   but

you're offering me extra ammo   things change   yeah   uh   some things don't   be safe   yeah  you too         somebody tried to take it off of him   killed him   he's about the same age as ben

all right  we'll do it your way   which way are they coming   blanchard   that's the watertown shopsmart  i know it   click  grab that box     that's the building   there's a road here  there's a road here   we're gonna do our recon from here   we'll wait till it gets dark   then i go in first with dai   and hal   if it's clear  then you guys come in   we get the food  we get the hell out of there

truck  and you go to upland park   and go to the littleton bridge   but w what if it's a trap   well  we'll see  click  dover was   that was a skitter and two mechs   the grocery store in j p   had three mechs and two skitters   we're never gonna beat them  are we   they die  just like us   just got to get close   listen  i know that you're scared  and i know it doesn't seem like it  but we can beat them   we don't have to kill them all   we just got to kill enough of them   if we can make it too costly   too painful for them to stay  then they'll leave   they're wolves  we got to be porcupines   if we can hurt them  they'll leave   it hasn't worked so far   well  it will  'cause it has before   history is full of inferior forces  creating so much trouble that the invading army leaves     the athenians at marathon   the  uh  scots against the british at stirling bridge   and our revolution fought right here        red sox yankees  '04     we can beat them           all right

back   what would you do if you had the chance  to get your kids back   he's my son   you'll never kill enough of them to get him back   they die  just like us   you just have to get   close   so  you got to make a wish and blow it out quick   'cause it burns out fast   you know what the wish is   you sure that's okay   yeah   yay  happy birthday   it's all yours   matt  i'm sorry  i don't have anything   hal  dad  what's the matter with you   what   you forgot the thing    the thing we got for him   you're going senile   it's from dad   i know what this is   a ripstik   ride  fool  we only got 10 minutes     all right   it's time to go   all right  we're moving out   i want to make the great meadow by dark   we're gonna set up camp there   there's good cover there   karen  you're forward  hal  you flank     let's go         falling skies 1x02     the armory original air date on june 19  2011     sync  corrected by elderman     mech tracks   armory could be a trap   those weapons better be worth it   it's about six hours old  that's when the rain stopped   those ones are empty   okay  who's got the ball   hal  right here   think you can get it that far  old man    5 million says you can't hit the front steps     you make that a stick of gum  we got a bet   all right  buddy  you ready  ready for this       nemo  come back   go  go  go         matty   it's time to get up   if i see him  i'll let you know  i'm sorry   what was that   word's out i saw harnessed kids before we hit the shopsmart   they want to know if i saw their kid   aw  man  oatmeal again   we passed a denny's  maybe you can get a grand slam   bite me   not much of a morning person  are you  matthew   come on  you go get in line   i'll catch up to you  i have to go report in   you gonna go look for ben tonight   that's the plan   i found some sticks in the basement   want to play catch later   after school   tom  no sign of any skitters   but wherever there's a mech     weapons inside   didn't go in   didn't feel it was worth taking it on and attracting skitters   you were to be discreet   well  we had a little breakdown in discipline   we drew fire   who   jimmy   he's a good fighter    go back tonight  find out for sure   no  our agreement was that we would be going after ben  once we scouted the armory   which you haven't done   you're right   that said  just like the food stores  and the pharmacies that we've seen   it's probably empty  and the skitters are just staking it out   and you're probably right  but we need to know   hey  this isn't what we talked about   you find a better place to make camp   i scouted city hall   too many windows  buildings all around   i saw a factory on the edge of town  might work  though   i'm guessing you didn't see any harnessed kids   you know how much i want to   all right  let's go  come show me on the map   anne  captain weaver   dr  glass   couldn't help but notice  all your people are sleeping in houses  while the rest of us are in tents   my fighters need the best sleep they can get   and we need to be able to get the civilians  out of here fast in case of attack     wouldn't be feasible if everyone was in houses   well  maybe we take a few houses  and rotate some people through   what  are you their leader now   there's no leader   i'm a doctor  and doctors hear things   well  doctor  you tell your patients  that if they're dissatisfied  they're free to leave   if they want the protection of my soldiers   they can minimize the whining and be grateful for the oatmeal   they're not just eaters   they know that's what your soldiers say about them sometimes     they're eaters   they contribute to the fight   they cook  they fix clothing  they haul trash   dr  glass  a few years from now   when the skitters have been wiped out  or sent back to the undoubtedly hideous planet  that they call home   the concerns of the civilians will be addressed   until then  there's no time for this   dear lord   i did not come here to get in an argument     uncle scott wants a word with you   he has some thoughts on the aliens  he thought might be useful   happy to talk to him after i get a little food   oh  what i wouldn't give for an egg     some bacon    a hash brown   white or wheat   english muffin  fork split   with enough butter that would make  a doctor such as yourself worry about my heart   ha   you know  you never gave your opinion   on   the rights of the civilians   i don't think i've ever been to acton before   it's a nice town   civilians versus the military    it's an age old question   what side do you come down on   i think civilians are a liability and a hindrance   and i also feel  that they're the best motivation we have to fight   child  no   this way    just kick it   kick it  yeah   come on  come on  guys     here you go     scott  biology   children  biology   scott  biology  biology     it's from a greek word meaning  life discourse    that's from the dictionary  but you know what it is to me   to me  it is the study of the most miraculous gift  that has ever been bestowed on us   it is the study of the wonder and the beauty and the mystery  that is life itself   and to study it is to     well  is to learn humility  and responsibility and gratitude  right   yeah  matt   we're not grateful for skitters   no  no  we are not grateful for skitters  right   and we're not grateful for parasites or cancer  either   but they are part of life   and we're grateful for the chance to study them  right   and hopefully by studying them  we'll be able  to better figure out how to kill them  right   right   boy  yep  you bet   scott  i had a class of  uh    of older kids   and i had them brainstorming about the aliens   and they came up with mostly  you know   the stuff that we all talked about     that the skitters must come from a planet  similar to ours  and    mm hmm      that they have a wide range of temperature tolerance   anyway  this one girl came up  with something that made me think   she said  you know  whenever we've dreamed up robots   we've always imagined them to sort of be  basically like ourselves     a head  two arms  two legs   but the skitters have six legs   and yet  their robots  the mechs  are bipedal   now  why wouldn't they build robots  that look like themselves  you know   well  chances are  they've been studying the earth for a while   maybe they built mechs that way  to have a bigger psychological impact on us   maybe  huh   hey  hal   those harnessed kids you saw the other day     they were headed west   yeah  but they may have changed direction after i saw them   hey  you  uh  never asked if i saw your son   i figured you'd tell me if you had   after i saw ben  you know  i just     i didn't see anything else   we'll be going out tonight  i'll be looking for him   well  when you go  i'd like to go with you   all right   hey  do you need a hand   i got it  but thanks  okay   you could take mine   uh  oh  okay   she's kidding  i am   you are  right   o okay   um     hey  i saw you walk in past the outpost sentries   you looked tired   what were you doing by the outpost   i was in the church on the corner  praying   it's episcopalian  not catholic  but it's close   i wonder if the skitters have a god   i i know a lot of people have lost their faith   but mine is stronger than ever   good for you   the next time you get on your knees and pray   could you see if the big guy might get us  an operational b 2 bomber loaded with nukes   i don't pray for god to give me things   i don't think that's how it works   then what do you pray for   i ask god to show me what i could do for him   wonder who she was     girl who lived here   well  maybe she's still alive   she liked  harry potter    dad used to read these to me   i'd always fall asleep    he read them all to ben   lucky ben   maybe lourdes could read them to you   oh  for    she's just being nice   she's just trying to get in your shorts   karen  oh  don't play dumb   i'm sure you had plenty of experience  with the female admirers back at school   i played lacrosse   football players got the groupies   hey  you know there's no competition  right   hal  change of plans   whoa    uh  get a room   we got a room  could you knock   just wanted to let you know  we're going back to the armory tonight   we're going to

 hey   what you have  punk   is a  50 cal mounted to the back of a gto   you got 111 fighters and 200 civilians  camped out in the big meadow   i've been watching you     for two days   that's why we were staking out the armory   figured you'd be looking for guns   i'm not gonna kill your old man   ugh   now  he is your old man  right   i can't imagine you shouting out like that if he wasn't kin     you know what     we're not gonna kill anybody   not yet    you're all way too valuable   so  here's what we're gonna do   we're gonna make a deal   you lot for the  50 cal on the back of that car   maggie   darling  please escort young prince charming here  back into town  so that he can bring the terms of our deal  to the supreme allied commander  of the 2nd massachusetts   so  what were you

honestly believe that   i do   history buff such as yourself ought to know better   i taught the american revolution   you know how that turned out   yeah   but is that the right  uh     what do you call it    analogy   instead of us being the colonials  and the aliens being the redcoats   isn't it more like we're the indians  and they're the never ending tide of humanity  coming in from europe   how'd that work out for the indians   well  if you don't see any hope     why don't i just eat a gun   well   i'll tell you  professor   and this may come off as a little insensitive   considering the 90  of mankind that's already gone to the grave   but the arrival of these evil creatures  is the best damn thing that's ever happened to me   see  we've been on a bug hunt the last six months   and we've been having a blast   maggie  is that your name  no   huh   i could have sworn  i heard him say that your name was maggie   you heard wrong   i want you to consider something   and i want you to shut up   you should join us  we're fighting back   shut up   now   are you stupid   i figured it was worth a shot   you do anything like that again   and i will use the gun    get up     turn around   bag   walk   what do you call them    spidery bastards   skitters  that's good   we call them cooties  you know   like the  uh    kids' game   well  before the cooties came   i was always going up against cops  and  you know  people like me   but you go around killing people today  even the bad guys   and people tend to get a bit uptight   but cooties    it's open season on them   you killed any   a few   how   rifle   shoot for the head   it seems to do the trick   well  i hate to be the one to tell you  friend   but you've been going about it all wrong     you don't shoot for the head   you take out a couple of legs   you slow them down  it weakens them   then you take the head shot   you ever go one on one   this one i did solo   thought i was gonna die  but i didn't    it did   you ever take down a ship   the cooties and their robot friends  respond to sound  right   the ships    they go off heat  you know that   mm hmm   well  we raided the armory  right   we got ourselves a genuine bazooka  right   and we're like   all right    so we    we peel this engine block  out of an old volkswagen  right  and we set it on fire   it gets hot enough  magnesium just  you know   ignites  like staring into the heart of the sun   having a few beers  lo and behold     in comes this airship  right   billy takes a bazooka   gets a cootie bird in its sights   lets a shell fly   it arcs   i mean  it's going    i don't know   the ship must have sensed something  right   it must have sensed it   'cause it    it just deked out of the way   that would've been sweet     hey  you think i could have a beer   why the hell not   don't go anywhere     you've got one hour   anne  do you know them   no   wonder what happened to them   as far as i heard   people from this area  were herded to the camp in stockton   then nuked   after the kids were taken   what can i do for you  doc   i had some more thoughts on the housing   mm  you're still on that   actually  yes  'cause it's
