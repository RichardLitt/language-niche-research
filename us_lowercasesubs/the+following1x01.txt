dad  isn't it   oh  honey   _  woman  i need to speak to someone about joe carroll   fill this out  take a seat with the others   he then studied in the states   where he married and became a professor of literature  at winslow university   also  budding novelist   in 2003  carroll's first and only novel   the gothic sea  was published   it would go on to become a best seller   but in its initial printing   it was a commercial and critical flop   this triggered his piquerism   the act of stabbing  slicing flesh for arousal   ryan  that's not accurate   i'm sorry  would you like to say something  sir   by all means  if i've got it wrong   please correct me   ryan hardy   joe carroll was obsessed with the romantic period   his lectures consisted of thoreau  emerson   in particular his hero edgar allan poe   and like poe  he believed  in the insanity of art   that it had to be    felt   he didn't just eviscerate  he was making art   he cut out his victims' eyes as a nod  to his favorite works of poe   the tell tale heart   and  the black cat    see  poe believed the eyes are our identity   windows to our soul   to classify him as a piquerist  would be    too simplistic   okay  guys  thanks   mike weston   it's a real honor  sir   did my thesis on joe carroll at the academy   your book was   it was invaluable   it's a real thrill for me  sir   mason  hardy   wow  that was pathetic   man is a hero   took down carroll single handed   and the bureau still let him go   you haven't read his book  have you   he's on disability   turner said he lost it  went crazy   no  carroll stabbed him in the chest   punctured his left ventricular   he can't be in the field anymore   he's got a pacemaker keeping it all pumping   who are the women   carroll's groupies   we're interviewing anyone who visited carroll in prison   weston  carroll had 112 visitors in the last two years     who had the most access to him   was he confined to his cell   did he have any privileges   most of his time was spent preparing for his third appeal   riley  he'd foregone legal aid and was representing himself   his records   so he had access to a legal library   yeah  every tuesday  carroll was shackled and transported  to the sussex county law library   where he was confined to a sealed room  one guard   and furnished with law books   actual books or digital files   weston  digital  everything's archived  on the library's server   so he had internet access   it would have been restricted   because that would stop joe carroll   damn it  we need to rip apart the library's ethernet   get the cyber techs in here      man  weapon  she's got a weapon   stand back   riley  take it easy  ma'am  easy  easy  easy  easy   easy  easy   drop the weapon   drop the weapon  drop it   ma'am  ma'am  look at me  look at me   look at me   you don't want to do this  okay   just    just hand that thing to me   and everything's gonna be okay   lord  help my poor soul   no   lord    help my poor soul   no  no     she's right handed   she did most of the upper left region herself   but this is someone else   carroll possibly   we're running analysis for a match   thank you    once upon a midnight dreary     the raven     this fever called living is conquered at last    it's all poe   and what she said at the end    yeah  poe's last words   when found delirious on the streets of baltimore   he's believed to have uttered   lord  help my poor soul    is that water  sir   yes   mint   sure   we've run her prints   so far  we've found 7 identities    and 2 of them visited carroll repeatedly in the last 6 months   anything on the cell phone   disposable   the text said   do it now    carroll could easily convince  an unbalanced brain to do this   it's an exertion of power  theatrics     i have sarah fuller for you   hello   mr  hardy  it's been a long time   sarah  hi  how you doing   well  not great   listen  we're gonna find him   nothing is gonna happen to you  i promise you that   i really appreciate you calling   i'm just  um  happy to hear you're safe   bye bye now   good bye  mr  hardy   thank you   they questioned claire matthews   she won't speak to anyone but you  why is that   when i speak to her  i'll ask her   thanks   i really don't think you got enough food  babe   do we really have to feed the cops   i mean  can't they just order pizza   there's plenty of food   thank you  billy   so how's she doing   sarah  she's right here  she's fine   well  then why are we ignoring that hot cop candy  in the corner over there   is he single or what   william  he's not wearing a ring  i checked   man on tv     beloved by his students   and with his charm and good looks   he was understandably a favorite  amongst the female contingent   so poe's chief principle  insanity as art   this is the romantic period   death is about theme  mood  motif  emotional aesthetic   poe equates death with what   man  he equates death with love   no  not love  poe equates death with     sarah  beauty  poe believed that art was about beauty  and that nothing was more beautiful  than the death of a beautiful woman     helen    lenore    annabel lee    and to bereave beauty is     to elevate one's soul   weston  carroll never visited same web address twice   which suggests he's using various urls   who with   well  there's the rub  every time i access an ip address  it mutates   this is a fairly sophisticated virus   where were the guards when he was sitting there chatting online   who are these idiots   the detail changed  but there's one recurring name   jordan raines     jordan  jordy  raines    i got it   death row   works the night shift   was he working last night   uh     called in sick     that's him    prison guard   he helped carroll escape   get his home address   yeah  i got it   _  federal agents  open up   hit it   clear the room   room clear   all clear   he's not here   raines on computer  hi  hi  hi   say hi to the camera   guys   say hi  say hi   can you say hi to your friends   yeah  say hi    hi   your friends are out there   that's right  buddy   oh  sweet pup   you're gonna want to see this   can you smell them   ohh       bags  man     weston  what is that   it's a german shepherd  i think      he's been practicing   carroll was teaching him how to become a serial killer     i can handle dead people   you kill a dog  i go crazy   i got this little terrier mix   forget it   what is that   it's joe carroll's novel   oh  look  it's inscribed    jordy  you're capable of greatness   you just have to believe  joe    so this jordy guy  is lonely   he's unstable  vulnerable to kindness   carroll recognizes his potential and seduces him   he's emulating carroll  the animals   he removed their eyes   well  jordy looks to carroll the way carroll looks to poe   it's a godlike kind of worship   is carroll really that powerful   well  you know  when i first started to suspect him   all i had was instinct   i didn't have any evidence at all   i was having a hard time convincing people of my poe theory   in the book  that's when you started following him   yeah  everywhere  home  work  school   i was just waiting for him to get sloppy   that's when i first recognized sarah fuller   i'd seen her in his class   i used to sit there and watch him teach   you know  he was amazing   he could inspire people  it's a gift   hardy  let's go   where to   it's time you talked to claire matthews   woman on tv  no official word at this time   but sources have confirmed to us that woman is dead today  by her own hands   now the fbi is speculating the victim may have been  one of joe carroll's groupies     enough of that   as a direct mess    i say we watch a movie   actually  i think i'm just gonna lie day for a little bit  if it's ok with you guys   yeah   that's even a better idea   you should get some rest   billy  we're right next door  okay   you call us if you need anything  all right   we'll come running   i love you guys     love you  good night    all right   let's go     you want me to have manners   that was creepy   whole night's been creepy   yeah   it's so quiet   because everyone's in daytona having fun   everyone but us     the hangover has begun   told you not to drink   i'm not interesting enough to not drink  that's    you okay     annie   annie   aah   no     sorry   just to let you know  there's two officers  outside the door if you need them   sure  thank you     claire will be right down   hey  joey   do i know you   yeah  but i haven't seen you since you were this big   ha ha ha   let's let the man do his job   professor matthews     yes    hi   i'm agent ryan hardy  fbi   can i speak with you   sure   i didn't know about the eyes   it was withheld   try edgar allan poe   um   the tell tale heart     the black cat  both have strong eye allegories   the eyes are symbolic   the essence of identity   you should talk to my husband   he knows a lot about that time period   you're married   yeah  yes  i'm married  agent hardy  why   are we flirting   with this material  no  not a chance   hello  ryan   claire   i'm agent mason  miss matthews   i understand you wanted to speak to mr  hardy   yes  but i need to speak with him alone  please   i'm afraid that's not possible   i'm afraid i have to insist   would you excuse us for a minute   how's your heart   same   but you're drinking too much   have you heard from him   yeah  a week ago  this came for me   i thought you should see it   how does he know   he doesn't  he's guessing   no one needs to know about this   it's not gonna help us find him   we have two killers out there now   he's got help   are you a cop   joe's always teaching   it was ingrained in him  so that makes sense   it makes sense he would find a student   where do you think they would go   would he leave the country   no  joe's not looking for his freedom   he wants to keep killing   yeah  he's good at it   i need to find him  claire   and i don't think i know how   i'm sorry i didn't call you   it's been 8 years  ryan   i got the hint   i mean  i know   i know that  when the fbi found out about us  that was difficult for you   no  that's not why i didn't call   you deserve more   i belong in your past   i work better in people's pasts  i always have   uh  the girl safe  the last victim  she's    sarah fuller  uh  yeah  she's under protection   she's good  she's a doctor now   i'm glad someone was able to get beyond this   i'm sure that upsets joe   why's that   he fancies himself edgar allan poe   that was the impetus for writing his novel   poe died with an unfinished manuscript    the lighthouse    and joe's novel  the gothic sea   was sort of his way of finishing what poe started   mason  what was that about in there   it was personal   what do you mean personal   we have to get to sarah fuller   what did she tell you   carroll is gonna make a move   he wants to finish what he started   that would be sarah   it's right this way   i'm detective warren   miss fuller went to bed about an hour ago   officer pontz works the front door   another officer here   two men upstairs   officers   mason  where are they   officer watts   kelly  where are you guys   they should be here   sarah   she's gone  where is she     where the hell is she    i don't know   how did she get out of here   mason  we got an officer down  we got an officer down      go around   man  come on  neighbors next door  let's go   give me a light         get the lights  get the lights   hardy   _  turner  so the neighbors will wilson and billy thomas  left in their suv 40 minutes ago   no one thought to search the vehicle   there was no reason to check   she wasn't missing   watson  will wilson teaches public school  second grade   billy thomas as is a computer tech   he runs the fraud division of a regional bank   and i bet they weren't gay either   carroll placed them here to watch over her  until he was ready   riley  come on  they've been her neighbors for 3 years   she'd never suspect them   and now they're taking her straight to carroll   he's finding people to help him do it on the damn internet   it   it's like they're his followers   turner  i'm not buying two men would pretend to be gay  and shack up next to a woman  because some nut job told them to   prison guard worships him   ice pick lady is brainwashed to kill herself   these two guys have dedicated years of their lives to him   there's some kind of fanatical obsession at play here   it's like it's a cult  it's     nevermore    the raven    poe is symbolizing the finality of death   have you pulled the gps  where are the satellites   i knew you'd show up eventually     do something    this is the hardy i remember   how many checkpoints have you set up     get him out of here    don't just stand there     move    hardy         back off  dude   sorry  sorry   come on  sarah     god    you don't have to be rude     sorry  sir    come on   god   there's a killer on the loose   and you want me to have manners   that was creepy   sarah  the whole night's been creepy   yeah         behind you   ugh   unh           hey  what do you got   well  both men were listed in the prison's visitor log   you got a file on these guys   nothing except some property records in lake whitehurst     _    i came alone  joe   isn't that what you wanted   sarah  no  no   no  no  no   no     no  no  no  no     unh   hello  ryan     i was curious to see how your heart was holding up     unh   i see it has its limits     where is she   you know  the human eye is connected  by 7 muscles   i removed each one individually   you know how hard that is to do   sarah  no  no   sarah   no       no  no   you know how i love my little souvenirs   no       aah  ohh   no   she lasted much longer than i thought she would   she's quite the fighter     i'd like to turn myself in     i surrender   i surrender   stop   hardy   i surrender   come on  get off  off him  off him  get off him   i surrender   ryan  no   i surrender   mason  carroll's en route to richmond   he'll be placed in federal detention  until this is all over    couldn't crack it   i made so many mistakes   but sarah     i saved her   how'd you know he'd be here   carroll's book was inspired by poe's  last unfinished work  the lighthouse    sarah was his unfinished work   yeah   he wanted to get the ending right   _  joe carroll had 47 dedicated web sites   over a thousand blogs  chat rooms  online forums   could have multiple resources   mason  hardy   he'll only talk to you     sarah had to die  ryan   i know it's sad  it's tragic   poor thing   she worked very hard to get her life back together   and she'd done quite nicely   which is more than i can say for some   oh  you've been quite the disappointment  ryan   now i never expected you capable of  in cold blood    but what was it with the true crime drivel   so what's my sequel about joe   everyone outside is anxious to know   hmm  well     it's going to be a collaboration   we're gonna write this together  ryan   my first book was clearly too avant garde   lost in literati pretense   now my new story     will play to a much wider audience   hell  even poe whored himself out eventually   so the prison guard   the gay neighbors   how do they figure into your new plot   we know about the cult   i'm not a big fan of that word   i like to think of them as my friends   it's important to have friends  ryan   did you know that the fbi estimates  that up to 300 serial killers  are active in the us on any given day   oh   sorry  didn't mean to scare you   is everything ok   extra patrol this evening   i thought they caught him   i saw it on the news   still  mind if i look around   check your doors and windows   do you have any friends  ryan     come on in   i think everyone's asleep     i will be your friend  even though you slept with my wife   man on tv  there is breaking news tonight  from waverly  virginia   where serial killer joe carroll has finally been caught   the escaped convict was found at an abandoned    did she show you the letter   riley  what's he talking about  what letter   claire is very important  ryan   every good story needs a love interest   i'm going to bed     good night    good night   she's the only woman i've ever truly loved   she's the mother of my son   joey   and i'd like to see her   no  she'd never agree to that   she might just change her mind about that   claire  joey   joey    where is he  joey   carroll  i thought i might go more traditional this time   you know  villain  good versus evil   i need a strong protagonist  so that the reader can truly invest   a flawed  broken man searching for redemption   and that is you   you are my flawed hero   yes  i ensured that by killing sarah   she was the inciting incident   the hero's call to action   this is merely the prologue   this is just the beginning   that was the entire point of sarah's death   it was for you       everybody's looking for something          some of them want         if this book ends with anything other than your death   you better plan on a rewrite   aah  oh  guards  guards   joey  honey  where are you   where's denise   denise  where is   where is denise   carroll  guards  ohh  unh   that's enough   where's my son  joey   joey  where are you   call claire   it's just the beginning   it will be a classic   it will be our masterpiece   call claire   call claire     sync and corrections by
