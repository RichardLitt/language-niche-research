only two minutes   understand what i say    two minutes   ibrahim     i tried to get the agency to intervene   but they couldn't do anything   i'm sorry   so i have nothing to say to you   ibrahim  you said  your family was in hiding   afraid for their lives   i can get them to amman   tell me what you know   and i will personally guarantee their safety   why should i believe you will do what you say   we have to go  you said two minutes   the guards  they are coming   i need more time       you don't believe me   well  maybe i was wrong to believe you   you said you were an important man   you said you had information  about an attack by abu nazir     i have information    prove it   because unless you do   i won't protect your family       please  we're out of time     hasan  my family   my family  you promised to protect them   announcer  you're listening to  jim dawkins in the morning    dave  wake up  washington   this is dave sitting in for jim dawkins   we got a lot on the topic today   so why don't you get your phones ready  and give us a call   they say that washingtonians are apathetic and                          estes  last night  at 2300 gmt   one of our ground assets produced a live lead  on an enemy operating base in the korengal valley   nice of you to join us  carrie   how is it you are the only analyst  in this section that can't get to a briefing on time   i wanted the whole group to hear this   within the hour   delta team was on site   where they identified multiple insurgents on our hit list   minutes later  two uh 60 blackhawk gunships  lit the target with over 8 000 rounds   all 13 hostiles were confirmed kills   but  during the sweep   one of the deltas found something else     a padlocked door to an interior room   i wanted you to see for yourselves   get the fuck down   get him on his feet     what did you say     i'm an american     turns out he's one of ours   marine sergeant nicholas brody   mia since early 2003 and presumed dead     until now   carrie  what happened to his partner   brody was a scout sniper  they work in pairs   corporal thomas walker also went missing that day   according to sergeant brody   walker was killed during their captivity   but that shouldn't dampen  what is a major win for the agency and for everyone  in this room  you should all take a moment     give yourselves a big hand   because of you  an american hero is coming home   good job   what were his exact words  please   carrie  an american prisoner of war has been turned   he said this in english   yes  he whispered it into my ear  right before the guards pulled me away   and when he used the expression  turned      he meant turned    working for abu nazir   why am i just hearing about this now   because until ten minutes ago   i didn't know there were any p o w 's still alive in iraq or afghanistan   so you're suggesting that abu nazir         you're suggesting that abu nazir  planted intelligence in his own safe house  just so we could recover sergeant brody   i realize it sounds like a reach   to say the least   why not just drop him near a checkpoint  and make it look like he escaped   why would you sacrifice  because abu nazir  is playing the long game   this way  no one suspects a thing   except you  yeah  except me   yeah   and sergeant brody's due home  from germany tomorrow morning   which gives us just under 22 hours   to do what   to authorize a surveillance package   to tap his phones  wire his house   follow him wherever he goes   david will never sign off on that and you know it   of course he won't   the white house needs a poster boy for the war   and david just served him up on a platter   that's why i'm coming to you   i'm not going over his head  not on a hunch   but if i'm right  if he is a terrorist   we need eyes and ears on brody from the minute  he steps off the plane     never happen    but     out of the question  carrie     all right  fine  what do i have to do     prove that the safe house leak was planted   or at least give me a reason to doubt its authenticity   i'm in the penalty box  saul   i'm 5 000 miles away from my contacts   i can't collect intelligence from behind a desk   find a way   no  don't look at me that way   we're all fighting the same enemy here     we're ready for you  sergeant brody   your debriefing   i want to call my wife first             oh  i think that's mine   oh  no  oh     don't get it  don't   it might be one of my kids   hello   brody  jessica   it's me  brody   brody   come

of this  mom   gee  dana  i don't know  it's either the lying or the drugs   you're supposed to be looking after your brother   well  he didn't burn down the house   why don't you just do what you say you're gonna do  for a change  what  mom   you said you had something important to tell us   shit   what  ma   come here  you two   touchdown in about two hours   you need anything   no  i'm good  thanks   you'll have some time with your family first   then you'll meet the vice president   who'll introduce you to every major media outlet  in the whole country     reporter  the turnout is overwhelming here at andrews air force base  where sergeant nicholas brody is scheduled to land  in just under two hours   now a white house spokesman confirms  that the vice president will be on hand   do you even remember him   not really   as we reported  sergeant brody is one of two marines  who went missing in action eight years ago   during a mission into iraq  near the syrian border   a former marine scout sniper  sergeant brody was operating  in hostile territory when his spotter     hi  brody   the soldiers were then separated     you coming or not  mom   'cause i don't think it'd appropriate if we were late   yeah  let me just get my coat   are you really wearing that dress   but after the announcement  that sergeant brody  in fact  survived  the eight year ordeal and was greeted by a wave of enthusiasm  from an american public eager to greet a true hero   more details on sergeant brody's captivity  are expected to come out  over the coming days  but a military spokesman     you look pretty  mom   thank you   let's go       start in the living room   i got 30 minutes   and good to see you  too  carrie   who the fuck is he    relax  it's all good  it's my brother max   max  say hi to the client   hi   what happened to nick and eddie   out of your price range   i told you  for a grand a day   it's gonna be bare bones   hey  you got a bad feeling about this   you want to roll this thing up  before we get started  you just say the word   eyes and ears in every room   then it's back to my place to set up the monitors     no way you could delay the ceremony   not without looking like a complete asshole   he's in the head now puking his guts out   i thought the army docs did a complete psych eval   they did  so what's the problem   i don't know  david  maybe eight years at the bottom  of a hole had something to do with it   i have the vice president arriving as we speak   and i need him smiling and waving like a hero   like it's the fucking macy's day parade     the president asked me to thank you personally   i have to think the short list for the directorship  just got a lot shorter   well  i appreciate the consideration  sir   not

want a donut   two calls came in  both hang ups   yeah  one last night  one this morning   both times the wife answered  both times there was no one  on the other end of the line  did a number pop up on a tracer   no  and the calls were blocked  is there any way that     no  not without a subpoena   look  virgil  if somebody's trying  to make contact with brody  it'll only happen once   and when it does  we'll be there   all right  it's all good  relax   all right  i've got to get dressed   estes  many of the men and women in this room are involved  in the operation which resulted in your rescue  so we take  an extra measure of pride in welcoming you   thank you  sir   now  we've all read your debrief  from germany  so today we just have  a few more questions    clarifications  really     that might help us in our ongoing fight against al qaeda     i understand    good   good  we'll  uh  start with stuart strickland   lead analyst in our iraq section   strickland  sergeant brody  it's a pleasure   a few weeks after your capture  special forces conducted  a direct action mission against  a former police hq in garma     woman  according to your debrief   most of your incarceration  was spent at a secret military facility outside damascus   what landmarks  or structural details can you give us to help pinpoint      eight months you were smuggled overland  to an enemy operating base in afghanistan   now  after so many years  what prompted      sergeant brody  my name is carrie mathison   i served as a case officer in iraq   your picture was on our mia wall   i saw it every day for five years   it's good to meet you in person   thank you  ma'am   i'm sorry we were unable to find you sooner   i appreciate that  i'd like to start  with the first few days of your captivity  if you don't mind  not at all   how soon after you were taken did the interrogations begin   pretty much right away   what did they want to know   anything i could tell 'em about u s  ground operations   supply routes  communication codes  rules of engagement   when you were debriefed in germany   you said you gave up no such information   my sere training was excellent   and corporal walker   ma'am   did he give anything up   we were never interrogated together  so i don't know   but still you must have wondered  especially  after you learned of his death   i'm assuming  there's a point to all this  carrie   there is  sir  as you know  the first 72 hours  after a soldier's capture are critical   what he knows can be used by the enemy  during that period to devastating effect   the point is sergeant brody stopped being a source  of actionable intelligence fairly quickly   and yet he was kept alive for eight more years   i'd like to ask him if he knows why   i often wondered that myself   who was your interrogator   an al qaeda commander   his name was zayadi   zayadi   that's what he told me his name was  anyway   was this him   no   but you know who this man is   of course   every marine in country was briefed  on high value targets   did you ever meet him  abu nazir   was he ever present during any of your interrogations   no   look again     sergeant brody   no  i never met him   what what    what about walker   did he ever mention abu nazir   no   you sure  carrie  how many times  does the man have to answer the question   it's just  i'm just a little surprised  sir   abu nazir was in charge of coordinating attacks  against coalition forces at the time   no one had more  reason to sit down with the only two american p o w 's  in his custody   well  apparently  he didn't   is there anything else  carrie   no  sir  that's it   thank you  sergeant brody   thank you   moving on  sergeant brody   i'd like to turn your attention  to anything you may have witnessed  or overheard when in captivity   chris  remember mrs  base   dana  the math teacher  yeah   yeah  she was  like  my least favorite teacher of all time   she's so annoying   hey  can you guys come in here a second   hey  i need help getting ready for tonight   what's tonight   some of your father's buddies  from bravo company are coming over for a barbecue   there's a bag of corn that needs to be shucked   and the grill needs to be cleaned   i'll do the corn   so  do i have to be here   why is everything always a problem with you   i was just asking a question   i know things haven't been easy between you and me   but we all have to find a way  to be there for each other now  okay    yeah  okay   clean the grill   hello   brody  hey  jess   hey  how did it go   i'm actually still here at langley   i'm stuck in this debrief   and it's taking a little longer than i expected   how much longer   oh  only an hour or two maybe   well  don't forget  everybody's coming at 5 00   brody  sure  i won't be late   okay  bye  honey   sergeant brody you're a man who's endured  a terrible ordeal   brody  thank you  mr  vice president     anything   as a matter of fact  yeah  brody just lied to his wife   tell me  virgil  max is tailing his town car   brody just said he was still at langley   but he told his driver to drop him off at bluemont park   this is it  he's making contact   all right  i'll meet you there   where's where's bluemont park     saul   hey  late for a meeting off campus   how many boards can one man sit on   you kissed carrie mathison into my debrief this morning   i'm curious if that was her request or yours   hers  frankly  i'm surprised you didn't assign her yourself   since she's the only one in the section who's ever been to iraq   it's not her resume i have a problem with   it's her temperament   what happened   she turned a routine follow up into a cross examination   kept trying to connect brody to abu nazir   it's always nazir with her   i won't deny  she can be a little obsessive on the subject   is there something i should know  saul   not that i'm aware of  because the last time  i heard her like this  she bribed her way  into an iraqi prison  caused an international crisis   i appreciate your concern   carrie has learned her lesson   and we both know how good she is   what did i tell you when i agreed  to give her one more chance   you said only if i agreed to do the babysitting   i said it would end badly   for both of you   you've got a big blind spot where she's concerned   trust me  i did  too   now my wife lives in palm beach   and i only see my kids twice a year         did you fix the audio   well  we'll know soon enough   i set up a directional mic  near the band shell  max  switch  to channel three   somebody's approaching brody  from 1 00    a female  dark red coat       woman  i didn't think you'd be able to make it   i don't understand why you had to go through mike   why didn't you just call me yourself   i did  twice   are you recording this   woman  but your wife answered   she didn't give me any messages   woman  because i hung up   she hates me  brody   hates you  why   because i got remarried   jessica reacted like it was a personal insult   like i was publicly giving up hope that you  and tom were still alive   what the     who the hell is she   helen walker  it's the wife of the other missing marine   ah  well  then  she's not brody's contact   just keep listening     helen  the pentagon said you both were dead   and now they're refusing to give me any information  about what happened to tom   what do you want to know   how he died   he's gone   does it really matter how it happened   it does to me   he was beaten to death   were you there     no   thank you for telling me   i'm going home   want to be there in time for this barbecue   hold on a second   max  will you give us a minute   max  step out of the van   i didn't think that this was any of my business   now i'm thinking that it is   clozapine   i'm sorry   was i supposed to say something   just tell me i'm not out here  risking federal prison on behalf of a crazy person   i am crazy  it's not funny   if anybody at the agency finds out about this     i've got a mood disorder  okay   i looked it up  carrie   clozapine's an anti psychotic   i'm dealing with it   i've i've been dealing with it since i was 22   does saul know    god  no   no  nobody does   don't act so shocked   i mean  it can't come as a complete surprise   you know i love you  carrie  but i got to be honest   none of this is making me feel any better   what are you saying   that i'm making this shit up   well  maybe i am  you know  maybe it is all in my head   but you're in it now  virgil  up to your fucking neck   and so is your weird little brother   so don't even think about bailing on me   you think for one minute you get away with this   i thought that once i had some proof     do you have any     anything   even suggesting that sergeant brody's what you think he is   no   then get a lawyer   'cause you're gonna need one when you report  to the ig first thing in the morning     saul  please      there isn't anything to say   i i'm just making sure we don't get hit again   well  i'm glad someone's looking out for the country  carrie   i'm serious    i missed something once before   i won't    i can't let that happen again   it was ten years ago   everyone missed something that day   yeah  everyone's not me  i understand that   i doubt a grand jury will   come on  you recruited me  saul   you trained me   you put me in the field   tell me what i can do to make this right between us     what the fuck are you doing   good bye  carrie        aw  fuck     shit  shit                                        you know  i'm shaking his hand     he's the vice president     and i suddenly realize     i don't even know the guy's name       hey   hi   geez  you don't call  you don't write       we have to talk   'cause you can't keep ducking me   i'm not ducking you   i'm just trying to deal  with the situation  yeah  well   you're not the only one   look     i understand you want to do the right thing  and i support you  but  jess     three days ago we were about to tell your kids   we were talking about moving in together     mike   please            hey  you want me to forget it   you know  all you got to do is tell me  that it wasn't great between us             he's my husband  mike              chris  they're gonna burn   the burgers  oh   right   here   so  mike's been a big help to your mom  huh   he comes around whenever she needs him   you like him   yeah  he's cool   there you go   one's for mom  thanks   ow     josh  i'm just saying that i think  that somebody somewhere is looking at him right now and thinking  congressman or senator or     you know      can i ask you a personal question   don't you want to get a couple more drinks in me first   you're married   no   but you wear a ring   oh  weeds out the guys looking for a relationship   what   uh  i    i don't know  i guess i've never  heard it put so bluntly before   i just find it a lot easier  not to screw things up with people i don't know   come on  you can't be all that bad     what if i told you i betrayed  my only true friend in the world today   just played him for a fool
