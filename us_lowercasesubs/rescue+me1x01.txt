actually  i'm a psychotherapist   yeah   well  chief perolli has a friend down at headquarters  who thought it'd be a good idea  for these doctors to stop by the firehouse  for a couple hours at a clip  so we could get our feelings off our chests   um  may i   we're finding that the     effects of 9 11 are still being felt   especially among members of the police and fire depart     jesus  look at the lion   unbelievable   i'm losing everything to mother nature here   rats   so i'm  uh  here to help   if anyone would like to talk   but  uh  we don't have to talk to you  if we don't want to  right   no  you don't  but     i had a 20 there  chief   thanks   look  doc     oh  you don't need to explain   i was at another firehouse last night   the reaction was quite similar   yeah  the guys are not  uh     they're not gonna talk to a psychotherapist  you know   in the firehouse     especially a female one   what about the female firefighters   we don't have any female firefighters in this house   are you threatened by women   no   you don't seem to think that a woman can be a firefighter   i'll tell you what   it's not about being a man or a woman  okay   it's about doing the job   it's about me getting home safe and sound in the morning  to see my kids  okay   so if you got a woman  who can do the job better than the guys in my crew   bring her on  you know   you got a martian or a cyborg  or a chinaman that can do the job   bring them on too   are there any chinese firefighters   yeah  probably   somewhere in    china   i'm sensing a lot of hostility   you are very  very perceptive   that's what they tell me   mm hmm   you want us to talk about our feelings   yes  i do   forget 9 11  all right   five years ago   black kid   ten years old   pulled him out of a closet   hot fire all around   he's burnt   he's scared   and he's slippin' and slidin' around in my arms like a     like a goddamn baby seal   and i almost got him outside   and his skin     he's wearing nothing but underwear   and his skin comes off  like wrapping paper off of a christmas present   he slips right out of my arms  he falls on the floor   pick him up  get him outside   a few months later  he dies in the burn center   three years ago  a project fire  six stories up   one bedroom apartment   fifteen people living in it   and i     i find a little girl   she's hurt pretty bad   holding a kitten   i bring her down  six stories   six goddamn stories   i'm switching my mask off with her and the kitten   and her and the kitten and me   her and the kitten and me   she's crying up to me the whole time   saying   please  mr  fireman  please save my kitten   please don't let anything happen to my kitten  mr  fireman     and i'm biting my tongue  'cause i hate cats   i think they suck   i come from a dog family   anyways  long story short     the cat lived     she didn't    we lost four guys from this house   one of 'em was my cousin jimmy   my best friend     best goddamn fireman i ever worked with   good family man   dedicated american  blah  blah  blah  you know   and every day  i gotta drive to work   i drive through my neighborhood   i see guys  drunken assholes that i went to high school with   who stand on the corner  high  having a great time   and i gotta wonder why     these assholes are still walking around  when jimmy keefe ain't   my cousin  the priest  says it's because     it's all part of god's plan  like god's got a plan   you know what   if there is a god     he's got a whole shitload of explaining to do   hey  billy  there's a dr
