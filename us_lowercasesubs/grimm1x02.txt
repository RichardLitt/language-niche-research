come on   are you still dizzy   i'm all right   well  your liver enzymes are elevated   and we found traces of a neurotoxin  in your blood  phtx3  which is usually associated  with a spider bite   lucky you didn't get more of it   or it would've paralyzed your lungs   well  if you feel lightheaded or feverish  come on back   all right   they find anything wrong with you   just a few toxins in the blood   just a few toxins  like the kind that can kill you   well  apparently not   you gonna be okay   how do i look   like a cop who's been working all night   aw  that's funny  hank  that's how you look   well  then you look good   marie   she's not stable   we can't allow anyone in the i c u  yet   well  when can i talk to her   after we're done running the tests   we can't risk letting her slip back into a coma   i'll call you the minute we know something   i d  anyone who wants access to the room   how is she   well  she came out of the coma   but they're still running tests   so when did the attack happen   about ten minutes after i got here   she came up behind me   she had a syringe in her hand   how do you know she wasn't a nurse   well  she stuck a needle into me  and she ran away   well  you think you can identify her   yeah  she should be on the security tapes   i grabbed them when i got here   they're on their way to the precinct   let's take a look at those tapes   if we got another killer on our hands   we better get on this   when's the last time you saw your aunt before this   not for a couple years   i don't know what she's been up to   that's her   was she alone   she's the only one i saw   it'll be difficult to make an i d  from the back     is this all you got    yeah   let me know if you get something we can work with   dude  what'd your aunt do to piss off so many people   she work for the government or something   i had a d u i  out on highway 2 about an hour ago   driver's got some crazy story  about her boyfriend being attacked   name's gilda darner   what do you think   ah  grown up way too fast  single parent  if she has any   takes way too many chances  and looks for excitement    in all the wrong places    sounds like me   yeah  look how you turned out   gilda darner   this is the house  this is where it happened   somebody got here before us   stay in the car   what are you doing here  i haven't even called it in yet     well  what do you got    breaking and entering   mr  and mrs  rabe got back from seattle  a couple hours ago  found their house broken into   somebody raided the fridge  hit the liquor cabinet   tried on some clothes  and test drove a couple of beds   any sign of violence   no  no blood  no body parts   only stains we've come up with are wine and whoopee     who's her missing boy toy    says his name's rocky   we're still trying to figure out  how much of her story is true   well  she's copping to the b and e  so some of it is   where are the owners   upstairs   somebody was sleeping in our bed   sleep had nothing to do  with what they were doing in our bed   you have an alarm system   well  we've been a little lax in using it lately   we're pretty remote out here   i mean  we've never had a problem before   you should see the living room   nothing was stolen   don't know yet  nothing obvious   you have quite a collection   is that a fijian war club   yes  actually  it is   and a new guinea tribal fork  this is some valuable stuff   you know your aboriginal art   i've never seen one like that before   it's germanic  uh  very rare   from about 900 a d   we belong to organizations  that protect native land from development   there's a lot of rich cultural heritage disappearing   and we're trying to protect what's left  both locally and globally     honey  i think you're getting a little irrelevant   well  you have to respect your ancestors   right  detective   i had to respect mine   otherwise  i couldn't sit down for a week   anyone else have access to the house when you were away   just our cleaning people   and our son barry  who's staying with friends   and our neighbors  the colberts   who check on our house from time to time  when we're out of town   fijian war club   second wife was an anthropologist   so there were two people in that house   so where's gilda's boyfriend   my guess  rocky's home right now  sleeping it off   ohh  ah   sync and correction by mlmlte  so you do this   break into homes  party hardy     we were just having fun    illegal fun   gilda  you said after you dropped out of the window   you heard rocky scream   you started running away from the house   and something chased you   yes   it's my fault   i should've gone back for him   but   i just left him there   i left him there   please  please  you've gotta do something   gilda  do you have any idea who was chasing you   a man  a dog   some kind of animal   i i don't know  i don't know   i couldn't really get a good look at it   i was so scared  i just wanted to get out of there   i know that something terrible has happened to him   they went to rocky's house  rocky wasn't there   talked to his dad  truck driver   just got back the night before last   hasn't seen rocky     what about his mother    died when he was a kid   did he have a cell phone   used to  dad said they had to cut back on expenses  so     did he have any idea where his son might be   he said if you find his pickup   that's where he'll be   well  his truck's already been impounded   gilda was driving it last night   that's all i got   what if their little party got out of hand  rocky got hurt   maybe he fell down the stairs   maybe gilda pushed him  broke his neck   gilda got scared   dumped his body in the river or into the woods   now she's trying to make it look like she's innocent   i don't think she's trying to cover anything up   it seems to me she's pushing us to find him   i think we have to take another look  at that house they broke into   hello   i need to see you  now   she's very weak   but i realize you may not have much time   i'll be right outside   i was afraid i lost you   not yet   you're all i have left   i don't want this to happen   i know  but you'll be all right   yeah  i don't feel like i'm gonna be all right   i'm still trying to make sense of everything   look  if you hadn't been here  i would've lost my mind   i'm not sure i haven't   don't doubt yourself     i've seen so much    and you'll see more   you have a responsibility that you cannot ignore   i couldn't ignore it if i tried   you have to hunt down the bad ones   just like your ancestors did   there's a reason that you're a cop   you have an ability  and you must use it   no matter what happens to me   i'll go get a doctor   no   the reapers followed me here   that means there could be more   how many are there   nobody knows   they're a secret organization dedicated to killing us   you mean grimms  there are more like us   yes  but i don't have contact with them   what about the things i've been seeing   how many more of those are there   there are more in the books than i've ever seen   you must not let the trailer be found   they don't know it exists   i hope i haven't done more harm than good by coming to you   let her rest   you can come back later   how is she   well  she's dying of cancer   she's had two attempts made at her life   other than that  she's doing all right   she's one tough lady   i had no idea   so you got anything on the rabes   yeah  their house sits on about 200 acres   backs up onto the national forest   of trees behind them   lots of places for rocky to get lost   these woods are too big for the two of us   let's get some people out here   whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa  look out   hey  nice riding   oh  i hope we didn't scare you   oh  no  you guys are lucky you didn't get thumped   look  we knew what we were doing   that's a good thing   'cause i hate cleaning blood off my car   you guys  uh  here for my parents   detectives burkhardt and griffin   you're barry rabe  you live here  right   have you guys ever seen either of 'em   oh  no  take your time   make sure you don't know them from school or anything   look  we've never seen them before   boys  dinner's ready  wash up   what are you doing back here   did you find out who broke into our house   yeah  i think so   frank  you should come out here   ma'am could you take a look at these   now  the girl's already in custody   but we haven't seen the guy yet   have you ever seen either of these guys   no     yeah  me  either    hey  barry   you didn't happen to come home last night  did you   he was staying at jason and t b 's house  while we were gone   sorry  mrs  rabe  we have to ask   just in case he saw the boy leave   no  i didn't get home till this morning   after my parents got back   no  i i didn't see 'em   how far away do you guys live   what is this   look  we're just trying to figure out  where everybody was last night   we know they broke into your house   but no one's seen the boy since last night   the girl said she heard a scream  inside the house after she left   and you believe someone who broke into our house   drank our wine  ate our food   and took advantage of our bedroom   i think you'd be better off looking under a few rocks   wish you'd remember that we're the victims here   boys  let's go in the house   if you want to talk to me   you can call me tomorrow at my law firm   man  we really hit a nerve   let's run some phone records   pin down where everyone was last night   she came out of the coma   and i've had to put guards on her   what do you want me to do   we can't allow her to tell him anything more     we need him with us    and how do i get to her   well  you don't  but you get somebody who can   with guards on her   don't worry about that  just find the right people     and i do mean people   we can't afford someone getting excited  and blowing the whole thing   don't you know this is a bad neighborhood   how much is it worth for you not to get hurt   don't worry  i'll take care of this   nick   yeah  in here   i picked up chinese from lotus  and       got voodoo doughnuts    ah  you are the best   don't be such a cop   the doughnuts are for dessert   are we buying a totem pole   no  i saw one outside a house of a case i'm working on   some kind of clan of the bear    the bear is a messenger to the supernatural world    his position of dominance in the totemic hierarchy   is the result of a common ancestral belief  in the sanctity of their territory    hmm   is the totem pole some kind of clue   i don't know  but you make it sound kind of sexy     it's just the word pole    mm   i stopped by to see marie today   it scared me  seeing all the police in the hospital   i don't know why anybody would want to hurt her   she can't even die in peace   how are you doing with all that   well  i'm not doing too good about it  but     you know  there's nothing i can do   so i'm putting on my happy face   i'm not buying that grin  put it back   okay  do it   uhh   that'll work   aunt marie   what are you doing here   remember what i told you   okay   there'll

 sorry  um     they use those claws in the roh hatz   roh hatz   it's like a bar mitzvah for bears   you know  a jagerbar mitzvah  it's a very physical thing   a lot of pounding of chests  and  like  wailing   who wails anymore   supposed to connect with the primitive beast in all of us   and believe me  i do mean all of us   so what do they do     it's all about the chase    what chase   the roh
