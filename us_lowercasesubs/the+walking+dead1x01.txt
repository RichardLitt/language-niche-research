 little girl   i'm a policeman   little girl   don't be afraid   little girl   what's the difference between men and women     is this a joke    no  serious   i never met a woman who knew how to turn off a light   they're born thinking in a switch  it only goes one way   on       blond     lit room   i mean every woman  every lady has a      i swear to god   come home   house all lit up   and my job  apparently because     because my chromosomes happen to be different  cause i then gotta walk through that house   turn off every single light this chick left on     is that right    yeah  baby   alright  reverend shane's preaching to you now  boy   the same chick  mind ya   she'll bitch about global warming   that's when reverend shane wants to  quote from the guy gospel and say  um  darling     maybe you  and every other pair of boobs on this planet  just figured out that the light switch  see  goes both ways    maybe we wouldn't have so much global warming       you say that    yeah   anyway  uh     polite version     still man  that    that earns me this   this look and loathing you would not believe   and that's when the exorcist voice pops out    you sound just like my damn father    always  always yelling about the power bill    telling me to turn off the damn lights       what do you say to that    you know what i wanna say   i wanna say   bitch  you mean to tell me you've been hearing this your entire life   and you are still too damn stupid to learn how to turn off a switch   you know     i don't actually say that  tho     that would be bad    yeah  go with the uh     the polite version there       very wise    yes  sir   so how's it with lori  man   she's good  she's good at turning off lights   really good  i don't know why sometimes      not what i meant     we didn't have a great night    look  man  i may have a     fail to amuse with my sermon  but i did try   the least you could do is speak   that's what she always says   speak    speak    you think i was the most closed mouth son of a bitch you'd ever hear to hear her tell it   do you express your thoughts   you share your feelings and that kind of stuff   the thing is     lately whenever i try     everything i say makes her impatient   like she didn't want to hear it after all   it's like she's     pissed at me all the time  and i don't know why   look  man  that's just shit couples go through   nah  it's    it's a phase     last thing she said this morning    mm   sometimes i wonder if you even care about us at all   she said that in front of our kid   imagine going to school with that in your head   difference between men and women   i would never say something that cruel to her   certainly not in front of carl   all available units  high speed pursuit in progress  lincoln
