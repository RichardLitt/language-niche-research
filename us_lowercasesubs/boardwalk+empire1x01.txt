you for that stirring poem   will you send me a copy   what a nice man   ladies   years ago there was a young boy  who lived in this very city   the winter of '88  some of you remember   a blizzard of biblical proportions   the family was snowbound and freezing   without food or heat   the father vanished    laid to waste by  alcohol   and so it was left  to this boy   this little man of tender years  to fend for himself and his family   off in the cold he went   worn shoes wrapped in rags   newspaper lining his thin wool coat   as he trudged chest deep in snow  to the rail yard   foraging on hands and bloody knees  for scraps of coal   hoping for some potatoes  spilled from a ruptured sack   finding none   he took a broom handle  and in desperation  killed his family's dinner   three wharf rats hiding in the hold of a ship   terrible  yes   but the family survived   and the little boy   well  the little boy speaks to you tonight  from this very podium   prohibition means progress   never again will families be robbed of their fathers   held hostage by alcohol   how proud i am  to live in a nation which   god willing  this year will finally give s women the right to vote

  never stayed at home            he'd go out with the boys and leave his wifey all alone            then the town went dry  jones began to cry            with no cafes or cabarets i know i'll surely die            for weeks it had him worried            but now he's feeling gay            i heard him tell a friend of his            out on the street today  say             i never knew i had a wonderful wife            until the town went dry            the way i spent my money on women was a crime            i found that with my wife            i could have had a better time            i'd send her to the country            and i'd always shout hooray            but i saw her picture in a bathing suit the other day            i never knew i had a wonderful wife            until the town went dry        sync by honeybunny
