previously on  the americans    philip  i'd like you to meet elizabeth   there is so much to talk about   philip and elizabeth's lives   not the other ones    those should never be discussed   super secret spies living next door   they look like us  they speak better english than we do   they're not allowed to say a single word in russian once they get here   oh  hi  you came  just for a second  to  uh  bring over brownies  and welcome you to the neighborhood   what do you do  stan   i'm an fbi agent   defecting to america  america's not so bad   the electricity works all the time  food's pretty great   is that what you care about   no  i care about everything  not the motherland   i do  but our family comes first   sorry  i never meant to hurt you   philip  what are you talking about   how did he hurt you   do what you want with him    the orders are going to change now   the risks are going to be greater   we won't let you down  general          mm  scott     what should i do       forget him  annelise   i'm here now   and i'm all yours    she's not cut out for this  she's been good so far   telling me things her husband says  probing him a little   this is a whole different thing   general zhukov said it would get riskier now   riskier  we're sending her into a lion's den   she knows how to get men to turn their brains off   that is no small skill  it's brought down empires   she doesn't care about empires   she cares about scott birkeland   patriotic swedish intelligence officer  and that is enough   i'm not sure she cares about him  either   she's half off her rocker         the k 19 class was deployed in '60 but retrofitted last year   they're not obsolete   they didn't say obsolete  they said the akula class  carried twice as many warheads and had twice the range   so  why should we develop countermeasures  against the k 19   i don't think the k 19 was retrofitted    i think it was retrofitted   but i'm gonna go look it up for you   my wife is almost never wrong   if the soviets get nuclear missiles into nicaragua   people won't be talking about the k 19s parked in our doorway  much longer anyway     excuse me  ma'am   what are you doing in here   oh  i was just going to look something up   this area is off limits  would you come with us  please   she'll be all right   well  if she's not   i'm walking into a room full of fbi agents   oh  my god  you won't believe what just happened   they questioned me  scott    two of them   of course  they couldn't stop  staring at my tits the whole time   but when i told them that my husband  was the deputy under secretary of defense   they were like   uh oh     smile    but i did it so perfect   i waited just like we talked about so it didn't seem forced   almost like i didn't want to use that   and they apologized to me   you're incredible  mm hmm     mm   scott  the way you make me feel    it's so      i've been with a lot of guys   it hasn't always been douglas   but with you  it's    it's different   you're    you're special  i think you're the one   i love you   i love you  too   god   i need you inside me so badly   sync and correction by geirdm    amador  a year from now  and he's done   it was a lateral move   they can cut your balls off  stuff them in your mouth   tie you to a radiator in a basement   and then call it a lateral move   bartholomew took the fall for timoshev   well  they did make him deputy chief  of the biggest division in the bureau   yeah  he's working for a guy whose ass he'll be sucking  till he can't take it anymore   well  that was fast   maybe it was on order  she's just picking it up   and they gift wrapped it in 15 seconds   let's take a look   stan  we're supposed to stay with her   stan   hey  how you doing   fine  yourself  good  thanks   hey  what can you tell me about that lady  that was just in here   not a damn thing   sir  we just have a few questions  like what'd she buy   what's her name   maybe i wasn't clear  i    i sell stereos   if you're interested in a stereo  i can help you with that   i'm interested in this stereo right here   it's a tx 470 mid range recei    hey   you can't go back there   sir  i'm just looking for a little cooperation here   and how are you gonna get it   oh  i don't know   should we beat him senseless   i don't know  he's kind of big   i said you can't be back here   this is private property  look at this   put that back    ruska    ruska yuh    what  six years of russian  and this is what you got   i got this  i got this  i said   put that back     ruska yuh buhlu   it's caviar   do you mind if i open this   yeah  i mi    hey   that is very fancy stuff   hmm   and you don't know the woman who was in here  huh   no     hey  give me that back   you can't do this  this is crap     philip  three days  elizabeth  when he said things would get riskier   i guess this is what he meant   well  no  this is isn't risky  this is insane   we need six months for this at least   philip  wha    no  i'll send a flash tonight  saying it's operationally impossible  these are orders  philip   yeah  and they'll listen to us because we're the ones on the ground   they understand what they're asking   you have a lot of confidence in them   think how important this must be for them to ask this   you want to do it  i don't want to   i think if they're asking  it must be necessary   we would be exposed from the first meeting   we don't know anything about the target   how are we supposed to get her to do it  without understanding her   we'll make adjustments as we go   are you being serious   zhukov said things would change   here we are   elizabeth  this is crazy   we have no choice       ow  sorry   that's all right  miss   so sorry   thank you   philip  dinner time   it's hot   and don't start with the pie this time   what  you let me eat the pie first last time   i know  and that was a mistake     paige  hey  mom  hi   did you finish the krazinski package   yes  all right   try not to give carla any trouble  paige   ha ha   where did you get that   the mall   it's just a bra  mom  i'm 13   e exactly   mom  things are different than when you grew up   people are  like  freer     we'll see about that  goodnight   have a good time   goodnight  mom  goodnight     hello  can i help you with something   we need to talk about your son   is there something wrong  yes   no    excuse me  excuse me   sir  you can't just come into my house like this   i'm sorry    can i help you with something   viola  is anyone else here  no   can i help you   excuse me  i     viola  i have to explain something very difficult to you   and you will be upset when i tell you   but i will help you   and that's the most important thing to understand   who are you  we'll get to that   first  i have to tell you the simple fact   grayson's been poisoned   that's why he isn't feeling well   by morning  his fever will be spiking   but it won't come down no matter what you do   he's been given a specially made formula  that only has one antidote   it's a liquid that i can inject into him  that'll make him completely better   no one else has this antidote   if you take him to the hospital  they don't have it   the greatest doctor in the world can't make it   only i can give it to him  and i will   do you understand   if i give it to him  he will be fine   but if i don't  he'll die in 72 hours   that's exactly what'll happen  if you don't do what i tell you to do   why are you doing this   i need something from you  and it's a little thing really   i need you to go to your boss's study tomorrow  and take the little  electric clock from the bookshelf  and bring it to me   i will then need you to put it back   and that is it    one  two   i will give grayson the antidote  he will get better   you'll never tell anyone about this   and we'll all live happily ever after   my nurse will stay with him during the day  while you're at work so you don't have to worry   water  viola  viola   if you talk to anyone  if you tell anyone   if you have me arrested   i do not carry the antidote with me   my people will give it to me once this is all over   so  if anything happens to me  he will die   but don't worry  it's very simple   do as i say    he gets better  one  two   no  no  you give it to him now   give it to him now  give him the antidote now   help     it's okay  it's okay  everything's gonna be all right   it's okay  can you quiet down   mm hmm   i understand  really  i do   so  let me help you get through this  please   will you let me help you and your family  get through this     okay   good  good   god  god will help us   please  god  oh  please  lord   please  help    please   that's my boy   that's my boy     she said god will help us   it's not good   people who believe in god always make the worst targets   she believed you  that's what's important   agent beeman's car is now back   i wonder what he's up to tonight   you worried   no  i just think      we're in for some late hours on this one  and     i just wish i knew his schedule       i try not to cross him too many times  in the middle of the night   you think he's still suspicious   he's not acting like it   but maybe he's the world's greatest actor   i still wish i'd seen him   trust me   when he saw the trunk was clean  the look on his face     he thought he was a complete fool   and you know what   if it was more than a crazy hunch   there'd be a whole fbi team in here   not just one guy with a flashlight  who thought we were asleep   still  some crazy hunch       obviously  he's no fool  but i think he's moved on   all right  i think we're okay   so  let's just    try not to run into him  too many times at 4 00 in the morning   make him wonder what travel agents are doing up  in the middle of the night    henry   henry would adjust    to anything   don't you think  if he had to   i don't know what you're talking about   if something happened to us   he'd find his way   but paige  i     i worry about her    they're both fine     he's like you   and her   she's delicate somehow       oh  viola  dear  there you are   have you seen caspar's datebook   it's in the dining room   oh  for god sakes   that man    god help us if we ever go to war   you look tired  are you okay   i haven't been sleeping very well   grayson   i'm worried about grayson  and     is he doing all right   yes  likes biology    never would have guessed that   and to think we almost lost him   well  it all worked out   thanks to you and mr  weinberger   oh  anyway  it's all right now   yes         oh  hello  miss radensky   hi   how was the conference today  long   waiting for philip   yes   can you finish with miss radensky up front  i got to go   grayson looked bad today   when viola got back from work and she saw him   she almost lost it   i think we got to minimize our trips   i should have taken that clock myself   no  absolutely not  you have to be half her ally   still  we've got to cover these meets as best we can   i don't think you should go alone    we're sitting ducks either way   she says something  that's it     come here   every     i'm not getting arrested   oh  god   so  what if there's 10 of them   what they'd do to us    tortured  locked away   told to betray everything we believe in  if we ever want to see our kids again   i'm not gonna make that choice  philip   one day  you could maybe find a way  to make them understand   so  go   if they are there  if it's me   they'll be at the house in an hour         did you have any

said you could pierce your ears  when you were 15   do you want to do it now   what   i mean  you can go to the mall  and you can do it with your friends   or i could do it for you right now   you know  my mom actually pierced my ears  when i was about your age   you do it   okay   tell me when it's numb   it's numb   you ready   yep   good         nott  the prime minister was very impressed  by how far you've come   weinberger  the president and miss thatcher  always see eye to eye   but it's useful when you and i chat ourselves  to make sure our bosses fully understand each other   the prime minister fully supports your efforts  to build a ballistic missile shield   provided it covers europe  as well as the united states   think what a different world we'll live in  as soon as we don't have to worry  about their nuclear missiles   amen to that   sync and correction by geirdm
