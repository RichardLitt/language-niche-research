 there are those who believe that a child in her womb shares his mother's dreams   her love for him   her hopes for his future   is it told to him in pictures while he sleeps inside her   is that why he reaches for her in that first moment  and cries for her touch   but what if you'd known since he was inside you what his life held for him   that he would be hunted   that his fate was tied to the fate of millions   that every moment of your life will be spent keeping him alive   would he understand why you were so hard   why you held on so tight   will he still reach for you if the only dream  you've ever shared with him was a nightmare   would he know my love runs through him like blood   john  now   now   the cops make you at the diner   i don't know  maybe   yes   definitely   sarah

long   six months  maybe  a bit of a whirlwind   you have no idea of the whirlwind   tell me   does the skynet defense system mean anything to you   how about this guy   miles dyson  i've never seen him before   that's because he's dead   your fianc e   firstly escaped from the pescadero mental hospital   blew him apart  two years ago   leveled a 4 storied research lab along with him   but since there's no lethal injection for the destruction of property   we'd stick with the murder of one of our country's brightest computer scientists   and     a dedicated family man   that's     that's just not       why would she do that    well  mr  daniels   it's the robots   the ones from the future   the ones skynet sent to kill her son     robots      which makes total sense   because in the future  john is not just her son     he's the    i'm sorry  excuse me   the leader of the resistance   fighting artificially intelligent machines   determined to annihilate  the human race   skynet     did he strike you that way   john   a leader of a scrappy band of rebels     luke skywalker type    don't be ridiculous   i came here for help  you can't really be asking me this   no  i'm not   this is just my pattern  mr  daniels   this is just me  impressing upon you  that i'm not here because you lost your fianc e   the love of your life  and all around good time girl   i'm here because my boss

border at lunch time   what year are you from    how long have you been looking for us    and the war   the skynet missile defense system  goes online april 19th  2011   declares war on mankind and triggers a nuclear apocalypse two days later   miles dyson died   someone else built skynet   who   we don't know   you don't know who builds the computer that blows up the world   i wasn't sent here for that   no   you were sent here to keep my son from being assassinated   your fianc  went to the police   you should have changed your alias   go to hell   they'd have found you anyway   they always do   it's kevlar in that chair   apb's statewide but it's been      what the hell happened here   like  why don't we have any bodies   where is the blood     that's a whole football team   guess what 19 of them saw   a shooter with some kind of robot leg   a shooter  with some kind of robot leg     why is this happening again   i don't know   you stopped it   i guess i didn't   but you can   look  you changed the future  you just didn't change it enough   so you can do it again   i don't know  john   because i can't keep running  i can't keep doing this   i'm not who they think i am  ok    some messiah   you don't know that   i know   i can't lead an army   maybe that's you but it'll never be me  so you've got to stop it   all right   please   mom   all right   all right   all right what   i'll stop it   we're not going across the border   where are we going   to find skynet   two years ago  i had to tell miles dyson  his research at cyberdyne would lead to the birth of skynet   i had to tell him he was the unknowing father of a nuclear apocalypse   he refused to accept his fate and died trying to change it   and if i'm to have any chance of tracking down skynet again   i have to tell his widow that even though miles changed his own fate   he didn't change ours   sorry  miles   mom  pizza's here   mom  the pizza   mom     you    we need to talk about miles  theresa   danny  go to your room   right now     how dare you come here    i know what they told you    but it didn't happen that way    get the hell out of here     now    it didn't happen that way   i can't let you do that     let go    listen to me   i didn't kill miles   i didn't do it   i would never   miles was a hero   but why are you here   we're back   you told me there'd be no more machines   it's happening again  everything we fought to stop   miles' work at cyberdyne is the only link we have   is there anyone     anywhere  who's shown an interest in his work   anyone he could have told  someone  he forgot   there is nobody  it's all gone   you destroyed it all   you and miles destroyed     you destroyed everything   we have to go   now   help me   help my son   mom   oh  god   what time is it    how are you feeling   better   good   we need to go   where   i'll show you   tell me what's going on   we're making a withdrawal   do you have an account here    safety deposit box   when did you open that    everybody on the floor   please   keys of the safety deposit boxes     get inside    keys   lock us in  and then get away from the door   i'll know if you don't   you said you had a safety deposit box   i do   open these boxes   put everything you find on the table   carefully   hey  james   you gotta see this   the alarm tripped seven minutes ago   the camera dumped a digital copy to the lapd servers   don't you know 'em   less and less all the time   is that from the future   can't bring anything through when you come   no weapons  no clothing  nothing   you sent someone back to build it   what is it   hope   is that the police     no  get away from the door    why   that's why   that'd better be what i think it is   one of our best engineers   to be made once he scavenged the parts   when the isotope solution turns red     you can fire    isotope       is this nuclear    no  not really   i don't get why you locked us in  we didn't have to get trapped like rats   we're not trapped   what is that   engineer got a job building the vault   so we'd always have a way back home   what have you done   you want to find skynet  you want to stop skynet     this is the way    you don't know who built it   no  but we know where and we know when   we can go kill it before it's born   we can stop running  stay in one place   fight   mom  we gotta go  now   mom   do it   where are we   same where   different when   check this out     yeah    oh  yeah   hey  baby  i got something for you   so this is where it all starts   this is where skynet begins   somewhere in there   and nobody knows we're here   you're safe     no one is ever safe    no one is ever safe   come on   it is said that the death of any one person  is the death of an entire world   certainly for parents   the death of a child is no less than a holocaust   in the case of my son   these words are literally true   and finally tonight  an amateur video of what we can only assume  is a college prank gone wrong   hi  did you hear me   we're late     come on  babe    i heard you  were late   and even though we've traveled through time   bent the rules of nature     in the end   no one lives forever   they will keep coming for him   keep trying to kill him   but until that day   it's gonna be a goddamn dogfight   http   projet sg net
