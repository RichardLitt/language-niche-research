it's interesting  because     this the only videotape we found in maudette's apartment   i guess that means somebody took them all  right   somebody didn't want you to see them   or somebody only wanted us to find this one   because it supposedly clears him of a crime  that maybe he came back later to commit   come on  andy   i'm not that smart   i can't feel my legs   quick  drink before the wound closes     would i be a vampire    you won't be  goddamn it   do you want to live or not   go back to the green room   turns out i'm first in the walk and talk challenge   walking and talking

could come in   look  it's 3 00 in the morning   you have no idea what i've been through since last night   i spent the whole day thinkin' i'd really killed maudette pickens   oh  my god   i thought i'd accidentally strangled her during sex   and bud and fucking andy waited  that proved i didn't do it   i thought i'd ruined my whole life   do i taste different from other people   yes   what are you   apparently i'm not dead   what i am is telepathic   i can hear people's thoughts   even mine   that's why i like you so much   i can't hear you at all   you have no idea how peaceful it is after a lifetime of     may i ask you a personal question   bill  you were just licking blood out of my head   i don't think it gets much more personal than that   how do you manage a social life  with men your own age     their only thought must be      i don't date   ever   oh  i've     i've been on a few dates   man  i can't wait to see her naked  i wonder if she's a natural blond   nothing worse than a blond with a big  black bush   what the heck   not every guy was a pig   the kind of girl i could marry and spend my life loving   and never have those thoughts of matt damon  jake gyllenhaal in jarhead  with that little santa hat on  where you goin'  what's wrong   but  it always ends up the same   there must be some people who know about your talent   the people closest to me   but    we never talk about it   and i do my best to stay out of their heads   over the years i've learned how   i figure it's kind of unethical to listen in to my family  and my friends  my boss   but    they know   other people suspect or    they think i'm psychic   most people just think i'm crazy   what does it sound like   it's sort of like  a stream of consciousness   gets weirder when people are mad  or     upset and     sometimes     sometimes it's just images   i should be gettin' home   bill  i feel completely healed   you are   do doctors know that v juice can do this   and we wanna keep it that way   i should show you to your car     how you doin'  motherfucker    what's up  joe   sexy ass over there   hey  baby   big boy  what's up  you   what's up  baby   i'm terrell   tara  all right   so what's  a fine girl like you  doing sitting here all by herself   i'm watching my fool cousin trying to hit on the straightest man here   all right   baby  i am the straightest man here   really   you can just ask any one of these honeys   look   i should tell you  i am married     that's not a problem for me    well   my husband is a mercenary   black oil   he just got back from assassinating some guys in iraq     you makin' this shit up    i wish i was   'cause he ain't worth me  i can tell you that  if he caught me with another man   he'd kill us both   i'm not sure who he'd kill first   probably me   i hope so   bitch  you crazy   he already shot one guy in the nuts  just for buying me a cd   hell  no   fuck   oh  my god   this how you wanna play   how old are you     am i allowed to ask that    i was made a vampire in 1865     when i was 30 human years old    you look older than that   life was harder then   were you in the civil war   i was   would you be willing to come  talk to my grandmother's club   it's    mostly a bunch of old people who had family in the war   they call themselves the descendants of the glorious dead   the glorious dead   there is nothing glorious about dying in a war   bunch of starvin'  freezin' boys   killin' each other so the rich people can stay rich   madness   i'm sure it was awful   would it make you happy if i did this   it would make my grandmother ecstatic   would it make you    happy   yes   i'll do it then   and look forward to meeting your grandmother   when may i call on you   i'm off work tomorrow   just after dark then   sam's still up   that's creepy   we never should have given them the vote  and legitimized their unholy existence   the american people need to know these are creatures of satan   demons  literally  they have no soul   but reverend newlin  you must be aware of polls  that show consistently growing support     for vampire rights    those polls are fixed   do you know how much money these monsters have givent o politicians  of both parties  as well as the corporate media   that's nonsense  vampires don't seek to control human policy  it's of very little interest to us  we simply want the     you can't trace any of it  it's all been laundered   are you accusing my organization of criminal activity  sir   i will not speak to her directly  sharon     why is that  reverend newlin    my commitment to christ jesus   praise his name  compels me not to recognize her kind   that's gonna make it difficult to have a dialogue   i will not speak to her directly   thank you  sharon  now  tbbn     i don't think jesus would mind if somebody was a vampire   i don't either  honey   is this sausage different from what you usually make   it tastes so much more complex than it usually does   oh  dear  you think it's gone bad   no  it's delicious  it's like i can close my eyes  and i can see the farm the pig lived on   and feel the sun and the rain on my face   and even taste the earth that the herbs grew out of   good morning  tara   no  you sit down     i'll make a new pot    all right     you look awful    yeah   well  i feel even worse   yes  you can take a shower here   and you can borrow some of my clothes   thanks   any news about jason   yeah  we heard already  they let him go last night     i knew they would    i didn't   well  i'm glad to see you're still alive   you obviously did not hook up with that vampire last night     sometimes you are just plain dumb    shut up   lucky gran was already in bed when i got in last night   did he bite you   are you sure  'cause you know they can hypnotize you   yeah  and black people are lazy  and jews have horns   you must be glad they let jason go home miss stackhouse   i can't even believe that they arrested him to begin with   i have a good mind to call bud dearborne and chew him out   jason's a good boy   everybody knows that   i'm sorry i was such a bitch to you last night   well  i'm sorry i been acting like i'm your mother   i just worry about you     you're basically my only friend    am i too late for breakfast   i'm so glad they didn't lock you up   me too   i don't even know why they suspected me   i think somebody heard i'd been with maudette   had you     no    are you sure   she was a woman   that's funny  at least she was human   you will never believe what happened     hey  gran    sit down     i'll fix you breakfast    what happened   apparently   a tornado touched down over at four tracks corners   it turned over that rent trailer in the clearing   you know the one   and it killed that couple    that's been staying in there    mack and denise rattray   they were trapped under the trailer   mike spencer said they were crushed to a pulp   what are you doing here   you know mike spencer   of course  you buried my parents   yep  my new job  parish coroner   but i still run the funeral home   that's gotta be convenient   this is still a restricted crime scene   why are you here   when i heard what happened  i just had to come look   what an awful thing   you know  i did hear you weren't too fond of the rattrays   where'd you hear that   my niece is the emergency room nurse in monroe   says somebody busted up old mack pretty bad last night     and everybody says that it was you    they were hurting a friend of mine   this be that vampire i been hearing about   the one who was living at the old compton house   the old compton house     just across from where i live    that's the one   your grandmother lets you associate with a vampire   you can take that up with her   i'm sure she'd just love to know that somebody thinks  she's not taking proper care of me   the rattrays were draining him   draining vampires is against the law  isn't it   i was simply doing my civic duty by stopping them   and now they're dead   killed by a tornado   tornados hop   this one didn't land anywhere else   and nobody around here heard or saw anything like a tornado last night   are you telling me you seriously think one man could do all this   he's not a man   they're really not that different from you and me  if you bothered to try to get to know one   you're a good girl   i have to see you go down this path   lucky for you  sheriff dearborne  nobody's forcing you to watch   now  if y'all two rednecks will excuse me  i've gotta go   you know  he sleeps in the ground all day   i don't think he's gonna even look at the rug   i'm not doing this for him  i'm doing this for me   so i can be proud of my home   and how do you know where he sleeps   i don't  actually   what's that smell   what smell   it smells like rotten food  or something  you can't smell that   well  find it   you can't smell this   i better throw this out   jason and tara are coming over this evening as well     gran    well  they invited themselves   jason said that he wants to meet the vampire for himself   and tara said she thought she ought to be here as well   why everyone's getting their panties in a wad about some stupid vampire   did you want to be alone with him   i don't know   maybe   aren't you gonna tell me to be careful   you're always careful  sookie  about what counts   and i can depend on that  isn't that right   look  i'm just saying   do you want a vampire sucking blood out of you   i'm just trying to get to know the man  that's all   'cause that's where it's gonna end up  always does   what do you know about vampires  anyway   yeah  i know a lot more than i care to   oh  please  you ain't even got enough sense to pour piss out of a boot   that's my beer   you asked if i wanted anything to drink   and i said i'd have a beer   and that's when you went to the fridge   oh  my god  i'm so sorry     here    it's okay   i don't like it when you do that   i've upset you   since you're here   what's wrong   you have to invite me in   otherwise it's physically impossible for me to enter a mortal's home   seriously   come on  try   i can't   i can't even try   that is so weird   oh  bill  won't you please come in     thank you    so  if i were to withdraw my invitation  would you have to leave   well  i'll have to remember that   oh  my stars   of course   you don't     i    i'm sorry   your people  mr  compton   they were from this area i believe   yeah  my father's people were comptons   and my mother's people were loudermilks   oh  there are a lot of loudermilks left   but i'm afraid old mr  jesse compton died last year   yes  ma'am   that's why i came back to benton   there were no living comptons so  i've set up home in the old compton place   and as i expect the vra to pass     i wouldn't be too sure about that if i were you   a lot of americans don't think you people deserve special rights   they have the same rights you have   no  i'm just saying there's a reason things are the way they are   it's called injustice   listen  it's called   this is how we do it    this is my house  i will not tolerate rudeness   did you know the stackhouses  mr  compton   i remember jonas stackhouse   he and his wife moved here when benton was just a hole in the road   i was a young man of 16   isn't this the house he built  i mean  at least in part   yes  it was   did you own slaves   i did not  but my father did   a house slave  a middle aged woman whose name i cannot recall   and    and a yard slave   a young  strong man named minus   this is just the sort of thing my club will be so interested in hearing about   about slaves   well  about anything having to do with that time   i look forward to speaking to your club  mrs  stackhouse   now   if it's all right with you   i thought that sookie and i might take a walk   it's such a lovely night   it's all right with me  if it's all right with sookie     i don't think that's a good idea    i don't think it's your business   she's right  jason   look  gran  i am the man in this family   you are a man in this family  but i am the oldest person here  and this is my house  you better respect me  boy   actually   i'm the oldest person here   shall we   we shall   well  thanks for making me look like a fool in front of him  gran   you don't need any help looking like a fool   i went to the rattrays' trailer   i told you i was strong   i don't believe i fully gauged  the extent of your strength   over the years  we become stronger   and more skillful of hiding what we've done   you might want to remember for next time  tornados hop   they don't just land in one place   so i guess you've killed a lot of people   i killed a few by accident at first   i was never sure when i was gonna get my next feed   but it's all different now   there's tru blood   i can get donor blood from a clinic in monroe   or i can glamour someone into letting me feed on them for love   and then they'll forget all about it   did you feed on the rattrays   after i'd given you my blood  while you were healing   you drank a lot of my blood   what will that do to me   well  you'll have keener senses   what else   your libido will be more active   is    is that it   i'll always be able to feel you   i'll be able to find you fast   if you're ever in trouble  that could come in quite handy   you're gonna have to give me a minute here  bill   i'm feeling a little overwhelmed   of course   i don't know why your grandmother was so short with you   you're just trying to protect sookie   i hate it when people treat me like i ain't got a lick of sense   like i'm still just a kid   i don't know  in the way   i know what that's like   it sucks  that's what it's like   you feel alone in the world  like nobody understands you   or even sees you   sucks   that ain't right   because everybody is  you know  somebody   what   we're all just trying to be    trying to be seen to     to matter   you're right   how'd you get to be so smart   i'm not smart at all  i'm not   i am constantly doing things i shouldn't  and end up getting me in trouble   i'm a fucking idiot sometimes   well  can i tell you a secret   i am too   it's not that much of a secret   what  what    not that much of a secret    shit   i was supposed to pick up dawn from work   goddamn it   she gonna be all pissed     good night  gran    night  jason  drive careful   you said you could glamour somebody into letting you bite them   what is that  hypnosis   kind of   it's similar   all humans are susceptible to it   have you done it to me     and i never will    really   try     i don't feel comfortable with that    you chicken   can you feel my influence   no  not a bit  sorry   well  sookie  this is very strange   you don't like not being able to control people  do you   it's not a very attractive trait   humans are usually more squeamish about vampires than you are   who am i to be squeamish about something out of the ordinary   sookie  jason  y'all get out of the water now   how can our car insurance go up so much after just one ticket   damn it all to hell  iate having to ask mama for money   damn what all to hell   i can break open my piggy bank if you need some money     who told you we need money    mama   corbett  i swear  i haven't spoken a word   do you know why you're here   your parents  they're concerned about something  that can't possibly exist   but you and i are gonna put all this silliness to rest today   now  can you tell me what i'm thinking   i'm thinking about the color red and the number 9   the color red  and the number 9   the psychologist thinks  that sookie just reads our body language  and is highly observant  that's all   that's a relief  that's bullshit   isn't it   what's body language   why was that doctor so scared   because she was lying to me  that's why   because there is something to be scared of inside my little girl   oh  my god  she knows everything i'm thinking   oh  sweet jesus  what do i do   poor child  she can't   i was diagnosed with add   they tried to put me on drugs but my mama wouldn't let them   she knew that wasn't it   she tried to protect me even though i scared her   when did you lose her   just before i turned 8   both my parents   flash flood   i lost my wife and my children   everyone i knew from human life   most of them are buried here in this cemetary   you really don't consider yourself human at all   i'm not human   can you turn into a bat   there are those who can change form  but i'm not one of them   can you levitate   turn invisible   sorry   you don't seem like a very good vampire   what can you do   i can bring you back to life   this is where you live   since old compton had no living heirs when he died   ownership reverts back to me   i thought that wasn't for sure unless the vra passes   i haven't been getting in any trouble with the renovations i've been doing   although of course i've been doing it myself in the night   i need an electrician  but i can't get anyone to return my calls   maybe if i made a few calls tomorrow  i could come by after work  and tell you who to contact   thank you   take your clip out   may i   i can smell the sunlight on your skin   i should see you home   all right   what's the matter  baby  don't you like me   oh  sure

place and wear what i want   how come terry bellefleur don't wear a uniform   because i spend enough time in them   no  because you're a man   and sam don't feel the need to sexualize the men  in his employment the same way he do the women     you don't have to wear the uniform    thank you     remind me why i hired you again    affirmative action   loaded skins and a pitcher of bud  is that it

will stick up for her  if some asshole ever does her that way   would you tell rene thank you for helping me out with that jerk tonight   i was so flustered i think i might have seemed ungrateful   please let me get my period tonight  even though rene wants one of his own   but i sure don't want him to feel like he's being forced     did you just read my mind   sorry  i'm not very focused tonight   my private thoughts are none of your business   wanna step into my office   i swear i try not to listen   but i can't always keep my guard up   is it true you can't hear the vampire's thoughts at all   god  that's     i mean  that must be very relaxing for you   you know  not having to work so hard not to hear   can you hear me     i don't want to hear you    why not   i'd have to quit if i read your mind and i like it here     you don't have to quit    i've had to leave  every job i've ever had because i could hear my boss' thoughts   you might be surprised by what you find

reason you want to know   ever since i've been friends with sookie   i've just gotten a kick out of watching jason's escapades  with women  you know   sort of   god only knows what happened to my
