kiddo  you're the first person stupid enough to turn me down   is there any way i could still interview   you're hired   we are engaging in a battle  with a man who will stop at nothing  to preserve his fortune   arthur frobisher told his employees  to invest in the company  and then sold his own stock   she's on a mission here   and she won't stop till you're strung up in the public square   make the call  i want some leverage   my boss wanted me to check up on his investment   you're my sister  how do you know arthur frobisher   i catered a function for him and some businessmen   katie

we have a strong case   i'd like to take it to a jury and let them decide  what mr  arthur frobisher owes you   i say we end this here and now   i vote to accept the settlement   how could you have possibly made such a  catastrophic screw up   you're fired   get out of the car   my future sister in law  is a potential witness in the biggest case in patty's career   you think patty hired you just to get to katie   did she only hire me to deliver her witness   there's no way she knew about your friend   saffron   call patty   you know what this means   if katie can help the case  then  we're doing the right thing   if frobisher thought this would shut her up  it's done the opposite   what's this   a souvenir for patty   maybe one of these days i'll stop being impressed   ellen figures out  why you hired her  and you still get her to deliver the witness   i like ellen   i think she's going to have a brilliant future    jesus   ortiz  you better get in here   hey  boss  it's williams

luck with the frobisher clients   has ellen tried to contact you again   no   i like that she trusts you   run into her again   talk to her   where   the office   i thought you want everyone to think i was fired   all the more reason to stop by   clear out your stuff   work the relationship   page six   this morning's paper   i went shopping yesterday  arthur   it's in there today   no  thanks   they're saying i spent  20 000 on shoes  while your former employees are lined up for food stamps   yeah  well  you know   you can't pay attention to this crap  holly   i spent  2 000 and it was for the kids   all right  all right  i'll have ray fiske make a call   see if we can get them to print a retraction   then some shithead photographer chased us  and hit my car   but i can't go to the police  because that would just bring more press   bethie's friends won't come over   their parents won't let them  reporters are following her to school   i know  i know  she told me   this is not a childhood  arthur   you promised me that all of this would be over  after the government trial   look  there are things that are beyond my control   you know that   i am trying to settle this case   try harder   i offered them   100 million for something i didn't do   offer them more   give them whatever they want   okay   how much   one billion  two billion   i'll tell you what  why don't i give you  the pen and you write the check   you promised me  arthur   don't look at me like that   uh     thank you  ricky  it looks fantastic   i'll tell you what  why don't you eat it  though  all right   no  actually  come here  come here  come here   you know what   just pick the     peppers out of this thing and give it to the dogs   they'll love it   we have the met gala on sunday and i don't want to late  so  be sure you're home from golf   i'm doing everything i can to make this go away   tuesday night is the helping hands auction   i'm fine to go to that alone   holly  come on  don't do that   and we have to make a decision about the aspen house   are we going to keep building    or are we going to sell it    please   what  arthur  i heard you   you're doing all that you can   what do you want me to say   nothing   these are for ms  hewes' meeting with kathryn connor     well  good morning    morning   your ears must have been ringing last night     why is that    i was talking about you   really   aren't you going to ask what i was saying   well  i figured you'd tell me if you wanted me to know   all good things  ellen     all good things    thank you   there's a client meeting in ten minutes   come sit in   whoa  whoa  whoa   another week   what the hell are we talking about   frobisher offered us  100 million to settle  and we voted to accept it   nothing has been signed yet  mr  poplar   but it was a done deal   larry   ms  hewes thinks this witness can prove frobisher's guilt   i don't want to lose that money   frobisher is praying that you settle   the money's going nowhere   so what would you like from us   time  karen   this new witness was in florida  the same weekend as arthur frobisher   if you give us another week   we can find out what this witness knows   and i believe it will give us leverage   ms  hewes   you really think this could be the smoking gun   i'd like the opportunity to find out   sorry to be a stickler for the rules  art  but     uncle sam has designated this environment smoke free   i    called you  because our young friend katie connor  hasn't been to the restaurant in a week  nor has she signed the new paperwork   which could spell disaster   okay  art   what do you want to talk about   what happens if she leaves me   i beg your pardon   holly   bottom line it for me  will you   well  this is new york state  art   you'll write her a check  for half of everything   and the kids   well     she's the sympathetic mother who runs three children's charities     which i founded         and you're a controversial father involved  in a very public litigation to defend your reputation   you need her  art   now more than ever   she's the one person who's remained loyal to you   if she leaves now   we'll take a beating in the press   all right  all right  let me ask     and if we lose this  this  katie connor  what happens   if she doesn't sign the paperwork   it becomes a hell of a lot harder to destroy her credibility   look  art     the law is on our side   the evidence  is on our side   on paper  this case  is tighter than a bull's ass on fight night   but if patty hewes gets that girl in front of a jury     all bets are off   hey  i'm here to see patty hewes   welcome to hewes   associates   hey     how you feeling    nervous   come on back  patty's running a few minutes late  i'll show you my office   this place is incredible   i know   so  how many people are going to be in there   just you  me and patty  we'll go through your  florida timeline and make sure you're hitting  all the details about that weekend   i saw him two or three times that weekend   that's fine  patty just wants to see if  anything you can remember will contradict frobisher's testimony   so  i can read it off my notes   of course  it's not a test   i'm in here     another thing    yeah     you look great    thanks   i totally forgot to call you to ask you what to wear   ellen  felicia wants to see the two of us   okay   now   hang in there  i'll be back   sure   we've bought ourselves more time   the clients have agreed to give us another week   patty wants us to start prepping their testimonies   getting them to tell their stories   why go poking at wounds now   it'll make them want to settle even sooner   really   anyone else want to weigh in   ellen   um    i'm not sure   not sure what   i grew up with people like this   a  100 million settlement sounds like a gold mine to them   and it's softening their resolve   if you want them to turn it down  i think you're right to remind  them what they've been through  stir up their emotion   i could see the value in that   good   divide them up  each of you take a department   ellen  shadow andrew  see how we do it   now   the car's waiting downstairs to take you to newark   is patty leaving   no  no  she's still meeting with you   but i thought you were going to be there   patty'll take care of you  could you look after ms  connor  please   you'll be great   i'll call you when we're done   you're a smart girl  ellen   but you better watch your ass   what   tom shayes is gone   when it came time to recruit  we each backed our own horse   your boy tom bet on you   he was the only one who stood to gain when you got the job   what are you trying to tell me   i'm trying to tell you   you should think twice before you shoot your mouth off   andrew  patty called on me   yeah   you think craig and felicia care about that   you don't show up your fellow associates  ellen   the only way you're going to make it here is with our support   i was just answering a question   i have no agenda   well  maybe you better get one quick   you're in patty's good graces now because your friend's a witness   but that can change on a dime   olio santo from california   unfiltered from tuscany   i mean  it's damn near impossible to decide   the raging olive oil debate between giada de laurentiis  and the barefoot contessa   exactly   last night's food network   so  what is better     virgin or extra virgin  or is it all just  marketing bullshit   it's about acidity   an american or italian   i love a little family owned vineyard in greece   i'll write down their website for you     oh  good    i mean  it's expensive  but     nothing like manhattan  though   ellen was checking out this apartment on 91st and riverside   and i asked her to get some stuff for a salad   eight bucks for an organic tomato  can you believe that   great  katie  thanks   thanks for coming by   it was nice to meet you   we're finished   why   something else you want to tell me   no  no  i i    i just thought that we were going to look over the timeline   oh  i really don't see the point   although   i did have one question   how old were you   i'm sorry   i had just turned six   when what   when i realized i was a good liar   how old were you   i'm sorry  i don't know what you're talking about   your timeline   i don't buy it   so  right now you're going to do one of two things     turn around and get the hell out of my office   or tell me the truth   the truth  ms  hewes  i'm not lying     katie  don't  don't   it's me and you now  ellen isn't here   i don't understand   i want the straight story   and until you tell me  you're worthless to me   i don't give a shit about you   wait  ms  hewes  please  i     what aren't you telling me   nothing  i put everything i know down here   they want me to sign a new confidentiality agreement     yeah  i read it  it's very thorough    well  what should i do   do whatever you want to   sign it   these people are going to come after me again   i thought that you were going to protect me   until you stop lying   you're not my witness  and you're not my problem   please  ms  hewes  wait   hewes   associates  can i help you   we were told the girl  lives here with her fianc    have you questioned her   not yet   the front door was chained  but not locked   at approximately 9 15 a  m    we force entry  and we find this   the stereo's still there  tv   so is the computer   and most telling of all              you come to loot a place  you don't leave something like that behind   so  it wasn't a robbery   watch yourself  lieu   he was a good looking kid   so  what do you think   she caught him screwing around   i don't know what you're talking about  you got to slow down   she's crazy   who   patty  she she kicked me out of her office   she told me to sign the confidentiality agreement   i don't understand     i don't  either    ellen   she's accusing me of lying  ellen     about what    everything   you read what i wrote  i'm not lying   of course you're not lying   well  then tell that to your boss   you're the one who made me go in there   look  what the hell am i supposed to do now   katie  just calm down   go back to the apartment   i'll be there as soon as i can   okay   mr  frobisher   the girl just met with patty hewes   ray fiske wouldn't want me talking with you  but     i can't believe our hands are just tied here   you gave her a restaurant  mr  frobisher   what can we do  to keep her quiet   offer more money   no  you can't do that   the judge finds out  i could get nailed for  witness tampering   well   there's always a solution   what kind of solution   a permanent one   what  oh  god  no   what  you think that i would     it wouldn't get back to you   oh  we're we're talking about a human life here   sh she's an innocent girl   she didn't do anything   she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time   sometimes that's enough   you're serious  aren't you   you're actually suggesting     look  mr  frobisher   you're insulated  you have resources   this kind of thing is simpler than you think   so  how's that work   you    know a guy  you make a call   it's simpler than you think   yeah  of course it is   you become powerful enough   eventually  every option gets presented to you  doesn't it   yes  sir   one day  you're living your life   the next thing you know  some man shows up  on your doorstep and offers you the  ultimate decision   that's all it is  mr  frobisher     just another decision   no  no   you go down that road  and then   you know  who are you   i mean  there's no going back   no  no  no   think about your family  mr  frobisher   don't tell me what this case is going to end with someone's life being destroyed   why should it be yours   you get what you need   yup   from the palm beach county p d   issued the morning of the frobisher event   katie's hiding details   she left it off her timeline   a traffic ticket seems pretty insignificant   her supervisor's kitchen report  says she was right on time   so  she managed to show up for work ten minutes  before she was pulled over for running a red light   find out more   fiske is making his move  trying to ruin her credibility   there's something in this girl's past   all right  i'm on it   get me everything you can   boyfriends  jobs     vices    yeah   i want to know why she was late for the biggest day of her career   you think ellen knows the truth   uh  it's too soon to tell   anything else   yeah  here's the ellen information we talked about   are you sure you really want to do this   make it happen   go long  go long   katie  i'm just grabbing my shit   where have you been     thinking    why didn't you call me back   katie  slow down   tell me exactly what happened   ask her   i tried  she didn't call me back   ellen  i already told you   she's crazy  she thinks i'm lying   about what   i don't know  i don't     i don't know what shd doing  it doesn't make any sense   i don't think she wants you to know   why not   because ten minutes before my meeting with her   she sent you away  you think that's a coincidence   come with me tomorrow     we'll go in there together    we'll both talk to her   i'm not going back there   where are you going   look  i have been living with you for a week   this has gone on for long enough     katie    ellen   i've got to get home  i have got a life to live   and i don't know anything about frobisher anyway   take it easy     get off    what   hello   do it   yes  sir   oh  shit   that was intense   patty appreciates your involvement   what's the girl's name   ellen parsons   do you have what we need   yeah   here's everything   the fianc    he's in there  too   my associates  will look into it   thank you   nothing too excessive   patty's come to me before   trust me   i know how she wants it done   don't hover in the door  i hate that   what happened with katie   i spoke to her  ms  hewes   i don't believe she's lying   really  why is that   because she has no reason to   don't be stupid  ellen   everyone's hiding something   really   so what are you hiding   i beg your pardon   you didn't need me to meet with the clients yesterday   you just wanted me out of the office  didn't you   yes   so you lied to me   what's your point   why would you do that   you already answered your own question   i wanted to meet with katie alone   so you      i manipulated you  yes   well  i don't like being manipulated   duly noted   anything else   yeah   you promised to protect katie   now she's totally confused  she has no idea what to do   i have a temper  too  ellen  but i've learned when to use it   you were right   she's using me   of course she's using you  ellen   patty hewes needs people who are driven   she's tapping your energy and youth  to further her own agenda   which is   you know what  it's highly unusual for us to be speaking like this   you're no longer a summer associate of mine   i know   i offered you a job and you turned me down   i didn't know who else talk to  mr  nye   my advice to you  ellen   is stop trying to figure patty out   you'll never change her   but she'll change you   how   by giving you access to how she thinks   you signed up for this  now  keep your head down and do the work   that's why you're there  isn't it     yes    then don't be shortsighted   start using her   learn everything you can   then get the hell out before it's too late   how exactly will i know when that is   that's for another walk   patty   phil  there's another credit card charge   you're going to have to be a little more specific than that  sweetheart    1 200 for a place called frolic   that's a gentlemen's club  i told you about it   the singapore clients come to the city  they love that crap   i can't drag them out of the champagne room   fine  but this was last week and     and i was in london   i'll have a talk with michael   what's an outcall   patty  i'll have a talk with him   what is it   he must've hired strippers   hired them out   you mean our son had them in our apartment   maybe  maybe   michael's too smart for this bullshit and it's getting out of hand   jesus christ   patty  i'll handle this   you know  your plate is full  just    i'll take care of it  all right   patty   yes   i'll take care of this   okay   tom   told you  ten years   one box  one trip   you didn't deserve this   thanks  i'll be okay   i know i'm only here because of your support   don't believe that for a second   how're you doing   you okay   i am     really    good  i'm glad   you know that friend you told me about in the stables   did you ever  uh     you ever tell patty about her   i guess we probably shouldn't discuss business   sorry  you're right   you're absolutely right   i got a cab waiting for me  downstairs anyway   you take care of yourself  ellen   thanks  tom   all right  i'll see you around   hey  are you following me   i don't know what you're talking about   you killed my dog   you killed my dog     i don't you or your dog    get away from me     lady  back off    stay

we do rise to our feet when a lady enters   it's signed goddamn it   that's wonderful news   it's  all systems go  for your restaurant   you got what you want  just leave     me alone   and to think  for a reasonable fee   she's available to cater any occasion   come on  goddamn it   yeah  where  where the hell have you been   look  i just heard from ray fiske   she signed the papers  call it off   we could do that right  we can call it off   no  yeah  but can we call it off  answer my    god   shit  god     hello    goddamn it   oh  my god   hi there  i'm arthur   i just came by to say hello  uh     oh  wow   i hear it's full steam ahead for the opening   oh  hey   my god  i love this   mr  fiske told me that you  uh   you signed our agreement   you have no idea how grateful i am   lawyers  right   they make such a big deal over a little   a little red tape   you and i  uh     if i recall     god those are beautiful   we never really spoke when we were down in florida  did we     no  no  that's right    yeah   i don't mean to be rude  but i didn't  even really rember who you were     look  i'm not sure what      but your meals   oh  my god   who could forget that   well  it was kobe beef     fingerling      mr  frobisher  i         and just a sprinkle of       saffron    right   god that was great   are gonna have that on the menu   look  mr  frobisher  i'm  i'm gonna go now  but    please you stay as long as      no  i'm sorry   no  please  forgive me   i just wanted to come by and say  say thank you   isn't life great     sometimes  i mean you  you and i  we meet  as total strangers at some boring luncheon down in  florida  and the next thing you know we're   we're partners  making something absolutely beautiful   our fates are intertwined  katie   isn't that remarkable   i'm sorry to have bothered you  thank you  katie   frobisher showed up at my restaurant   why did you call me   because you're right   i lied   the day i cooked for frobisher   so this was   about june 2002   yeah  saturday morning the 19th   i was rushing to work and got pulled over   why didn't you put it in your timeline   it's all so humiliating   i met a guy  down in florida   had a stupid one night stand   it was a low point for me  i was     kind of a mess back then   a guy  whose name is      greg   i never got a last name   we met friday night   partied pretty hard and went back to his place   he seemed like a genuinely nice guy   sure   then saturday morning i overslept   which is why i was late   rushing to work  and why i got pulled over   did you see him again   no  but     kate     i got pregnant   and it was the one night and   i never even got his phone number   and i just did what i had to do   i'm sorry   ms  hewes  i swear this is the only thing i left out  everything else is in there   when did frobisher's people approach you   fiske called me   about a week later  and said that arthur frobisher  liked my cooking and wanted to help me open a restaurant   and what happened to greg   no idea   ever since frobisher's been in the news   there's never been a connection   i've never heard his name  never seen him   nothing   you do understand why i lied to you  right   yeah   then     will you still be able to use me as a witness   well  you and i will go over your timeline step by step   hopefully  they'll be something that will impeach frobisher's story   but kate     you're stepping into the spotlight now   details of your life are going to come out   this kind of scrutiny is never easy for anyone   i understand   it's just     my brother and ellen don't know anything about this stuff   you don't have to tell them  do you   well  at some point the truth is gonna have to come out   i'll let you decide when   i spoke to katie last night     you're working  if it's a bad time      no  no     what did she say   well         you were right   she's not hiding anything   i trust her   but i want you to know that i had  reasons for doing what i did   when i read her confidentiality agreement   there was a section i found curious   yeah   ray fiske had snuck in a medical release waiver   katie signed away access to her medical records   well  fiske must think that     there's something in katie's past that would  destroy her credibility as a witness     well  there isn't    well   let's hope not   meanwhile  she's given them everything they want  so     she's protected   yes   and you've had a very good first week   what are these for   a quiet  little place on the upper west side   nice light  safe street   i think you'll like it   how did you     katie mentioned you were looking for an apartment   oh  i can't possibly accept  ms  hewes  i     please  please   you got a great bargain     i did    i know the head
