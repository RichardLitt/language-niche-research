say it in front of her   okay   dad hasn't been home in a few days   so   he's working overtime on a  miller time   shift  he'll stumble back in sooner or later     miller time  is a slogan for a beer   dad's on a hunting trip   and he hasn't been home in a few days   jess  excuse us   we have to go outside   i mean  come on  you can't just break in the middle of the night and expect me to hit the road with you   you're not hearing me  sammy  dad's missing   i need you to help me find him   you remember the poltergeist in amherst  or the devil's gates in clifton    he was missing then  too  he's always missing  and he's always fine   not for this long  now  are you gonna come with me or not    i'm not   why not    i swore i was done hunting  for good     come on  it wasn't easy  but it wasn't that bad    yeah    when i told dad i was scared of the thing in my closet  he gave me a  45   what was he supposed to do    i was 9 years old   he was supposed to say   don't be afraid of the dark     don't be afraid of the dark    are you kidding me    of course  you should be afraid  you know what's out there   yeah i know but still    the way we grew up after mom was killed  and dad's obsession to find the thing that killed her   but we still haven't found the damn thing   so we kill everything we can find   save a lot of people doing it  too   you think mom would have wanted this for us    the weapon training and melting the silver into bullets    man  dean  we were raised like warriors   so  what are you gonna do    are you just gonna live some normal  apple pie life    is that it    no  not normal  safe   and that's why you ran away   i was just going to college   it was dad who said if i was gonna go  i should stay gone   and that's what i'm doing   dad's in real trouble right now if he's not dead already  i can feel it   i can't do this alone   yes  you can   yeah  well  i don't want to   what was he hunting    all right  let's see  where the hell did i put that thing    so when dad left  why didn't you go with him    i was working my own gig    this voodoo thing down in new orleans   dad let you go on a hunting trip by yourself    i'm 26  dude   all right  here we go   so dad was checking out this two lane blacktop just outside of jericho  california   about a month ago  this guy     they found his car  but he'd vanished  completely m i a     m i a    missing in action  so maybe he was kidnapped   yeah  well  here's another one in april   another one in december '04  '03  '98  '92     all men  all same 5 mile stretch of road   started happening more and more  so  dad went to go dig around   that was about three weeks ago   i hadn't heard from him since  which is bad enough   and then i get this voice mail yesterday   dean  something is starting to happen  i think it's serious   i need to try to figure out what's going on   be very careful  dean  we're all in danger   you know there's evp  on that     evp   electronic voice phenomenon  not bad  sammy  kind of like riding a bike  isn't it    all right  i slowed the message down and ran it through a goldwave   took out the hiss  and this is what i got   i can never go home   never go home   you know  in almost two years  i've never bothered you  never asked you for a thing   all right  i'll go   i'll help you find him   but i have to get back first thing monday   just wait here   what's first thing monday    i've this     i have an interview   what   a job interview   skip it   it's a law school interview  and it's my whole future on a plate   law school    so we got a deal or not    wait  you're taking off    is this about your dad   is he all right    yeah  you know  just a little family drama   but your brother said he was on some kind of hunting trip   yeah  he's just deer hunting up at the cabin   and he's probably got jim  jack  and jose along with him   we're just gonna go bring him back   what about the interview    i'll make the interview   this is only for a couple days   sam  i mean  please  just stop for a second   you're sure you're okay    i'm fine  it's just    you want even talk about your family  and now you're taking off the middle of the night to spend the week end with them  and with monday coming up    it's just not kind of your style   hey  everything's gonna be okay   i would be back in time  i promise   at least tell me where you're going    amy  i can't come over tonight   because i got work in the morning  that's why   okay  i miss it  my dad's gonna have my ass   hey  uh  amy  let me call you back   car trouble or something    take me home   sure  get in   so where do you live    at the end of breckenridge road   you're coming from a halloween party or something    you know  um  a girl like you really shouldn't be alone out here   i'm with you   do you think i'm pretty    will you come home with me    um   hell  yeah   come on  you don't live here   i can never go home  what   what are you talking about   nobody lives here   huh  where do you live    that's good   joke's over  okay    you want me to leave    hello    hello    hey  you want breakfast    no  thanks   so how'd you pay for that stuff   you and dad still running credit card scams    yeah  well  hunting ain't exactly a pro ball career   besides  all we do is apply  it's not our fault they send us the cards   yeah  and what names did you write on the application this time    uh    bert aframian and his son  hector  scored two cards out of the deal   sounds about right   i swear  man you got to update your cassette tape collection   why    well  for one    they're cassette tapes   and two     black sabbath  motorhead  metallica    it's the greatest hits of mullet rock   house rules  sammy    driver picks the music   shotgun shuts his cake hole   yo sammy is a chubby 12 year old  it's     sorry  i can't hear you  the music's too loud   thank you   all right  so there's no one matching dad at the hospital or morgue   so that's something  i guess   check it out   let's go   did you guys find anything    no   nothing    no sign of struggle  no footprints  no fingerprints     spotless  it's almost too clean   so this kid  troy       he's dating your daughter  isn't he     ya   how's amy doing    she's been putting up missing posters downtown   you had another one like this last month  didn't you    and who are you    federal marshals   you two are a little young for marshals  aren't you    thanks  that's awfully kind of you   you did have another one just like this  correct    yeah  that's right   about a mile up the road  there have been others before that   so this victim    you knew him    a town like this  everybody knows everybody   any connection between the victims besides that they're all men    no  not so far as we can tell   so what's the theory    honestly  we don't know     serial murderer  kidnapping ring   well  that is exactly the kind of crack police work i'd expect out of you guys   thank you for your time   gentlemen   what was that for      why do you have to step on my foot     why do you have to talk to police like that    come on  they don't really know what's going on   we're all alone on this   if we're gonna find dad  we've got to get to the bottom of this thing ourselves   can i help you boys    no  sir  we were just leaving   agent mulder  agent scully   i'll bet you that's her   yeah     you must be amy    yeah   troy told us about you  we're his uncles  i'm dean  this is sammy   he never mentioned you to me   well  that's troy  i guess   we're not around much  we're up in modesto   so we're looking for him  too  and we're kind of asking around     hey  are you okay     yeah   do you mind if we ask you a couple questions    i was on the phone with troy  he was driving home   he said he would call me right back  and he never did   he didn't say anything strange   or out of the ordinary    no  nothing i can remember   i like your necklace   troy gave it to me   mostly to scare my parents    you know  the devil stuff   actually it means just the opposite   a pentagram is a protection against evil   really powerfull  i mean if you believe in a kind of thing   ok  thank you  unsolved mysteries   here's the deal  ladies     the way troy disappeared    something's not right   so if you've heard anything     what is it    well  it's just     i mean  with all these guys going missing  people talk   what do they talk about    it's kind of this local legend   this one girl  she got murdered out on centennial like decades ago   well  supposedly  she's still out there   she hitchhikes  and whoever picks her up     well  they disappear forever     let me try    i got it   dude   you're such a control freak     so angry spirits are born out of violent death  right     yeah  maybe it's not murder   this was 1981  constance welch  24 years old  jumps off sylvania bridge  drowns in the river     does it say why she did it     yeah   what    an hour before they found her  she calls 911   her two little kids are in the bathtub  she leaves them alone for a minute   and when she comes back   they aren't breathing   both died    our babies were gone  and constance just couldn't bear it    said husband  joseph welch   that bridge look familiar to you    so this is where constance took the swan dive   so you think dad would have been here    well  he's chasing the same story  and we're chasing him   okay  so now what    now we keep digging till we find him  it might take a while   dean  i told you i've got to get back by      monday   right  the interview   yeah  yeah  i forgot   you're really serious about this  aren't you    you think you're just gonna become some lawyer   marry your girl    maybe  why not    does jessica know the truth about you   does she know about the things you've done    no  and she's not ever going to know   well  that's healthy   you can pretend all you want  sammy  but sooner or later you're gonna have to face up to who you really are   who is that      one of us    no    i'm not like you  this is not going to be my life     well  you have a responsibility    to dad    and his crusade    if it weren't for pictures  i wouldn't even know what mom looks like   what difference would it make    even if we do find the thing that killed her   mom's gone  and she isn't coming back   don't talk about her like that   sam     where'd she go     i don't know   what the     who's driving your car    come on  dean  let's go   go    dean    dean    what     hey  are you all right    i'm super   car all right    yeah  whatever she did to it  it seems all right now   that constance chick    what a bitch    well  she doesn't want us digging around  that's for sure   so where's the trail go from here  genius    you smell like a toilet   one room  please   you guys having a reunion or something    what do you mean    that other guy  bert aframian  he came in and bought out a room for the whole month   i don't think he's been here for a couple days at least   salt  cat's eye shells     he was worried  trying to keep something from coming in   what do you got here    centennial highway victims   i don't get it   i mean  different men  different jobs  age  ethnicities   there's always a connection  right    what do these guys have in common    dad figured it out   what do you mean    he found the same article we did   constance welch  she's a woman in white   you sly dogs   all right  so if we're dealing with a woman in white  dad would have found the corpse and destroyed it   she might have another weakness   no  dad would want to make sure  he'd dig her up   does it say where she's buried    no  not that i can tell   if i were dad  though  i'd go ask her husband   if he's still alive   all right  why don't you see if you can find an address   i'm gonna get cleaned up   hey  dean  what i said earlier about mom and dad    i'm sorry   no chick flick moments   all right    jerk   bitch   hey  it's me  it's about 10 20     hey  man  i'm starving  i'm gonna grab a little something to eat at that diner down the street   you want anything    no   aframian's buying   so come home soon  okay   i love you   what    dude  five o  take off   what about you    uh  they kind of spotted me  go find dad   problem  officers    where's your partner    partner   what   what partner    so fake u s  marshal  fake credit cards   you got anything that's real    my boobs   you have the right to remain silent   so you want to give us your real name    i told you  it's nugent  ted nugent   i'm not sure you realize just how much trouble you're in here   we're talking  like  misdemeanor kind of trouble or  squeal like a pig  trouble    you got the faces of 10 missing persons taped to your wall   along with a whole lot of satanic mumbo jumbo   boy  you are officially a suspect   that makes sense 'cause when the first one went missing in '82  i was 3   i know you got partners  one of them's an older guy   maybe he started the whole thing   so tell me  dean     is this his    i thought that might be your name   see  i leafed through this   what little i could make out  i mean  it's nine kinds of crazy   but i found this  too   now  you're staying right here till you tell me exactly what the hell that means     hi  uh  are you joseph welch     yeah   yeah  he was older  but that's him   he came by three or four days ago  said he was a reporter   that's right  we're working on a story together   well  i don't know what the hell kind of story you're working on    the questions he asked me   about your late wife  constance   he asked me where she was buried   and where is that again    what   i got to go through these twice    it's fact checking  if you don't mind   in a plot behind my old place over on breckenridge   why did you move    i'm not gonna live in the house where my children died   mr  welch  did you ever marry again    no way  constance    she was the love of my life   prettiest woman i ever known   so you had a happy marriage    definitely   well  that should do it  thanks for your time   mr  welch  you ever hear of a woman in white    a what    a woman in white or sometimes a weeping woman   it's a ghost story   well  it's more of a phenomenon  really   they're spirits  they've been sighted for hundreds of years   dozens of places in hawaii and mexico  lately in arizona  indiana   all these are different women  you understand   but all share the same story   boy  i don't care much for nonsense   you see  when they were alive   their husbands were unfaithful to them   and these women   basically suffering from temporary insanity  murdered their children   then  once they realized what they had done  they took their own lives   so now their spirits are cursed   walking back roads  waterways   and if they find an unfaithful man  they kill him   and that man is never seen again   you think     you think that has something to do with constance   you smart ass    you tell me   i mean  maybe    maybe i made some mistakes   but no matter what i did   constance never would have killed her own children   now  you get the hell out of here   and you don't come back   i don't know how many times i got to tell you   it's my high school locker combo   are we gonna do this all night long    we just got a 911  shots fired over at whiteford road   do you have to go to the bathroom    no   good   fake 911 phone call  sammy   that's pretty illegal   you're welcome   listen  we got to talk  tell me about it  so the husband was unfaithful   we are dealing with a woman in white   she's buried behind her old house   sammy  would you shut up for a second    i can't figure out why he hasn't destroyed the corpse yet   that's what i'm trying to tell you  he's gone   dad left jericho   what   how do you know    i've got his journal   he doesn't go anywhere without that thing   well  he did this time   what's it say    same old ex marine crap when he wants to let us know where he's going   coordinates   where to    i'm not sure yet   i don't understand  i mean  what can be so important  that he just gets out in the middle of the job    dean  what the hell is going on    sam  sam    take me home   take me home   no   don't do this   i can never go home   you're scared to go home   hold me   i'm so cold   you
