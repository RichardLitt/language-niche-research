previously on sons of anarchy   load the m4's and glocks in the truck  huh   torch it     saw a lot of boot prints    shit eating mayans  man     the m4's    gone   as are most of the glocks     you got to see something else    goddamn   get rid of the bodies   don't want this shit hitting atf's radar   found a box of his old shit in the storage unit   just  like  pictures and journals   things i never knew about him  when you and dad hooked up   he ever talk to you about his vision  about what he wanted from the club   jax is going through some shit   he's asking me  did he want to get into running guns   he asked me if i thought we needed to rebuild the factory   i just want to make sure he's following in the right father's footsteps   we'll have all the mayan intel by the morning  we'll get our guns back   put the guns in the van  wire this shit hole up    got the good shit   there we go  boys   these muffins are great with tequila  bobby   shit is addictive   turning me into fat bastard   turbinado sugar  organic flour   no processed shit  not that any of you give a damn   you put hash in them   you know my rule  no bud before 9 00 a m     i don't have that rule    morning  kids   deal with the niners has officially closed   spoke to laroy  and he is giddy    about his new assault rifles    we're all about racial harmony   spend it wisely  boys  might be a while before we see any more gun green   i love the green   all about the benjamins   i just got an update from my city hall snitch   looks like hale's got a warrant to search our warehouse   shit   you're a little outside your jurisdiction  aren't you  hale   something blows up this close to your town   it would be bad law enforcement not to look into it   this is county property  sanwa sheriffs can handle this   you know this guy   rodrigo carpio   found him in the debris basin  three bullets in his back   bluebird supply business card in his wallet   from his rap sheet  i'm guessing he was employed as security     no kidding    he died 50 yards  inside charming   bluebird warehouse is part of my murder investigation  and that's a warrant   in case you'd never actually seen one     glad your boy's gonna be all right    yeah  thanks   i'm sorry about last night   should've had that place leveled before the mayans ever got there   made a shit call   yeah  i'm the one who should've been there blowing the shit up   should've never gone to tahoe   everything happens for a reason  if we hadn't hit that warehouse   we never would've known about the nord mayan hookup   right   i got to get this shit to rosen's guy   need a big jew brain to figure out these bluebird losses   not this big jew brain  baby  i can barely count my own fingers     gonna go see the kid later    yeah  i'll be there   and i still want to do that dinner  maybe tomorrow night     sure    okay   did he say anything about what he found in storage   doesn't matter   not his old man  stop worrying   hello   right   that was unser  got a protection run tonight   what   i got to tell you something  man  i mean  it could be bad   it already is   those two dead mexicans in the warehouse hole  i was hitting them   jesus christ     both of them    oh  yeah  yeah   kind of a taco twofer thing   tell me one of them doesn't have a belly full of tigger juice   afraid they both do   you did time  shithead  you are in the dna database   forensics team gets ahold of those bodies     i'll go pull them out of there   hale will be watching that warehouse day and night   maybe trammel can sneak me in   he's a county sheriff  he outranks the local pd  right   you're just gonna stroll out of there with two dead mexi whores    draped over your shoulders    i'll gut them dead bitches   i'll flush their bellies with bleach  no dna   what kind of nasty shit did your mama do to you   what do you mean   enough ammo in here to give halliburton a hard on   holy shit   jesus christ   tape it off   nobody enters   get me the eta on that forensic team   mr  bluebird just flew into a brand new cage   episode 102  seeds  what were you thinking    brother   i was thinking about getting my dick sucked twice   all anybody can prove is that a couple of brownies swallowed your chum  and died hiding from the fire  you didn't kill anybody   it's not about the manslaughter rap   the csu team tests those bodies   tig's dna puts the gun factory at our doorstep   and then atf takes up permanent residence in our collective rectums   that warehouse sits on county property   hale will have to wait days  to get san joaquin to shake loose a forensic unit   it's a local case  county won't get involved   hale'll just wind up borrowing a crime scene unit from lodi   big otto's sister still works for the a d a  in lodi   call her  see if there's a forensic team heading this way   i gotta have a talk with unser   maybe i can convince the chief to     put a leash on his hyperactive deputy   unser's just waiting for the clock to run out   that old boy's a lame duck   so your boy  not really a team player   i've made several gestures of friendship  he's declined every one   hale's not interested in friends   he thinks charming's stuck in 1969   wants to bring it into the 21st century   hale is a half bright clerk with a wyatt earp complex   hardly seems like a guy with a vision   don't underestimate him   he's tight with city council and his old man's  got deep political ties in northern cali   yeah  but you're the boss  right   come on  clay   since they found the cancer last year  i got one foot out the door   i mean  the squad's his now   be official in a few weeks   this uptight piece of shit is gonna make our lives miserable   do you understand what i'm saying   there's nothing i can do about it   the doctor and my wife  they're making me step down   i'm sorry  it's done   yeah  i'm sorry  too   this doesn't mean we can't keep our business arrangement   me and you  we had a good thing going for a lot of years   we need each other   yes  we do   what's the run   got blu rays and ipods heading down to san jose   goddamn niggers have been jacking the shit out of them   keep your eyes open on this one   i'll make sure they get where they're going   how you doing  jax   heard about wendy and the baby  i'm sorry   thanks   you know  i took a ride out to the streams today   saw that warehouse that burned down   outside your jurisdiction  ain't it   you ever hear of a bluebird supply company   apparently they hold the title on that parcel   never heard of them   whole area was littered with casings and gun parts   that warehouse was a weapons depot   no kidding   chief unser's retiring at the end of this month   i'll be stepping into those shoes   unser's always had a look the other way policy with the sons of anarchy     unser's a lazy drunk    i will not look the other way  jax   just a friendly heads up   we're all free men  protected by the constitution   you look any way you want  chief     he's moving around a lot more    yeah  all his vitals are up   any permanent damage   because of the drugs  brain or anything   can't know for sure   but everything so far points to full recovery   how long's he gotta be in that thing   could be weeks   but  he'll be in the nicu for at least two or three months   hey  look     i'm sorry about last night     i wasn't      i really don't want to know   right   what   just figured you'd land a million miles from this place   you always hated it here   oh  i didn't hate charming  jax  just     me in it  at the time   looks like wendy's gonna be okay   define  okay    we're taking her through sedated detox  she'll be out for a couple of days   you two     are you together   no  i filed over a year ago   she got clean about ten months back   we tried to reconcile   didn't work out too well   looks like one good thing came out of it   yeah  i guess it did   i should get going   yeah  i'm late for rounds   it's good to have you back   i'm gonna need the truck   why can't you take the wagon   we're three months behind   i got to lock it in the garage  or they'll repo it while i'm at work   i don't know how to get in front of this shit   getting buried here  donna   i'll pick up some weekend work   you'll get that pay bump soon   we're going to make it through this  baby   i promise   we'll figure it out   shouldn't you be at the mill   i'm on my way  i gotta ask a favor   what's up   three months behind on donna's car payment  they're gonna repo it     i hate doing this    if you ask me for money   i can't help you   i just made the quarterly insurance payments   i'm going to be tapped until the end of next month  okay   look  i'm sorry  son   that's all right   thanks  pop   clay  is making a protection run tonight for unser   it's low profile shit  you ride along     scare off the bad guys  huh    i think i'm on clay's shit list   doubt he'd put me on it     then why don't you make it right    i don't know   i don't know what the hell's wrong with you   why don't you quit whining   grow a dick  and take care of of your business   jimmy cacuzza called  the italians want to place an order     i didn't know what to say    how about the store burned down   they missed the fire sale   i talked to otto's sister   and lodi forensic team will be here first thing in the morning   and the shit keeps piling on my head   only one thing is gonna stop that lodi forensics team  from getting to our warehouse   and that's another murder in lodi   i don't know   hale's on red alert  mayans  nords    everyone's twitchy as hell  man     it's not a good time to kill things    it never is   but we talk about protecting tig here  and staying out of atf's crosshairs   we hit the projects  we find ourselves a scumbag   a dealer     we should off a couple of nords  clay  is what we should do   all right  we should just do that  then we'll dump the bodies in lodi   it buys us some time to get those mexicans out of the hole   it sends a message to darby     kill two birds with one crow   very clever  with the cops eyeballing the warehouse     doesn't matter    i'll handle that  you set it up   what if i could do this without spilling blood   this isn't me tripping some guilt shit because of my kid   this is about one of us thinking straight   brains before bullets  right   let's

something on your mind    no   something weighing on yours   junkie tell you something   no  she's still sedated   but i talked to her after that baby was born   she was crushed   she hated herself  but she wanted to live   no  somebody else popped her with that needle   or at the very least gave her the loaded gun   guess you think i'm that somebody   guess i was the one shooting it into her fingers and toes  the whole goddamn time she was pregnant  too   no  that sin's on her   if i were a cop  i'd call that motive   thank god you're only a doctor   we'll see what wendy says when she comes out of detox   or maybe i'll bounce my theory off of jax   see where he lands on it   that's how you'll win back his heart   accusing his mother of trying to murder his ex wife     come on  you are smarter than that    i am not trying to win back anybody   no  then why'd you come back to charming   because of the job   which one  doctor or detective   you still think you can just say  or do

floyd   that boy needs a hot shave   yes  he does    most of us were not violent by nature    we all had our problems with authority  but none of us were sociopaths    we came to realize that when you move your life off the social grid    you give up the safety that society provides    on the fringe      blood and bullets are the rule of law    and if you're a man with convictions    violence is inevitable    i hope they looked better than this when they blew you   a little   jax   jesus  it smells like old socks and pussy in here   hey  darling   they're having a sale on toiletries  i picked

they could've been napping   you guys   cruising around here like heroes   and you and i know the truth   what truth is that   you're white trash thugs holding on to a dying dream   that is so poetic  chief   i'm sorry  i guess it's just deputy chief   right   it doesn't matter if i'm chief or not   you can't stop progress   it won't be long before sam crow  is just an ugly memory in the history of charming   so you enjoy the ride     while you still can     you go get rid of those bodies    yeah  a'ight   should we say a prayer or something   you know any bible passages about lost semen   and
