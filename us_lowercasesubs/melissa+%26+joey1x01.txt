     look at you   public servant by day  hottie by night   well  i have to turn down the heat during the day    or nobody'd get anything done    ooh  council story's up   from now on we're capping  elementary school class size at 22 students   this is garbage   which is piling up in front of my restaurant  'cause you cut pick ups to once a week   well  a reduction in trash services  is what pays for the smaller class sizes   crazy guy with a trash bag coming at you  and you stay the mature  rational adult   yes  i did  suck it  garbage guy   oh  and then this dude  hey  don't be that guy   don't be that guy that brings your garbage  into a public arena and acts like a crazy person     act like a gentleman    thank you   now where the hell is the money  your brother in law stole from me   what my sister and my brother in law did was wrong  okay   but that's not me  let me ask the room   does anybody here have a relative they're not exactly proud of   whew  it's not just me  at least he was cute   yeah  i don't see it  but you held your own up there   you remind me of your father  the esteemed senator   oh my god  did i smell like strippers   no  you smelled like authority     oh  well  that is my fragrance    mm hmm   yeah  i have to say in all humility  i was  yes  smokin'     up high  down low    all right  okay   plus your brother in law's various felonies  totally shifted the focus of the meeting   i think you put the whole trash issue to bed   aunt mel  why are angry white guys throwing trash at our front door   there is a political debate in the community  in which the majority feels  this is getting heavy     and really smelly  i'm just  gonna leave this here for you  aunt mel     there's  like  10 more on the porch    mel  hey  lennox  lennox   did you see the dresser i put in your room   yeah  it's really cute  but i'm okay  i've got suitcases   she thinks living here is temporary  she no longer tells me what she thinks   i used to be i'll sneak you out  of the house aunt mel   let's get  matching tattoos aunt mel   now i'm because i said so aunt mel   i do horrible things like put furniture in her room   clearly  i'm a monster  of course she's

dad's suits on the driveway   added some top shelf cognac and lit 'em up   in a way  but we all need    to let things out every now and then    no  we don't   the urge to set things on fire  we repress   thanks for babysitting   i haven't had a date since the kids moved in   it's been so long  i'm actually nervous   all right  so what do you think   these say  smart  independent  bright

channel 5     she did what    what did she do     when  really    where  today   both  lennox did that     liz  i find that hard to believe    no  she didn't tell me     it's not at all typical    of course i believe you     i know when something's serious    is this really serious     i'm really sorry that this has happened    i'll talk to mel   but i'm telling you this couldn't have happened   guess what   today at school lennox handed out flyers  containing an original poem  rhyming her principal's name in a creative way that  didn't go over well with miss lunt   not to send up a flare   but there's a possibility channel 5 has the story     are you sure    pretty sure   i was just on the air  live  denying it   two months living with me and she gets suspended   legal guardian of the year  thank you   i keep telling you  hire somebody   an organizer  a professional   those kids need structure and discipline  and possibly electro shock therapy   and you  my dear  cannot do everything   well  maybe not everything   but i can certainly do this   it's just a matter of going up there  and setting that girl straight   i haven't moved yet  have i   why isn't my sister here to discipline her own daughter   because she's locked up in federal prison   man  that's a sweet deal   hey  lennox  remember you and me at the fall out boy concert   i just found this old picture   oh  you mean the one that was hanging  very obviously in the hallway outside the door   not obviously   affectionately   that was some night  huh  fall out boy  whoo hoo   where are we going with this   i was just remembering the good times  you know   when we shared  told each other things   important things     that happened    today   oh  come on  you didn't think   i got suspended  was something you might share   okay  i will share this  miss lunt is a fascist   why couldn't have called her that   instead of   you know   well  i never got in trouble at my old school   that's because your parents bought the indoor pool   it didn't even have a spa  what's up with that   whatever  look  miss lunt is expecting an apology   you and i have an appointment down in her office at 3 00 tomorrow   great  you let me know how that goes   lennox  until you talk to her you can't go back to school   oh well  guess i'm not going back to school   of course you are   this is your education  nothing is

hello    uh  hold on a sec    hey  let me ask you something   when's the last time anybody did any the laundry in this household     you people live like pigs    these are my delicates   how did you get my delicates  were you in my room   yeah     pull the trigger    hey  joe  you were right   i should have that sandwich now     hey  mel    all right  get back up there   at is he doing home in the middle of the day     his history paper    what    wow  all right  pack the veins back in your forehead   i took the kid to school  right   and he tells me he didn't haveis hisry paper   so we drive back here to get it  and then he tells me he didn't exactly write it   and i said   well  you'd better exactly write it because it's due today     so he's up there writing it n   and he doesn't come out until it's de  huh   now that's   that's nannying   you brought him home   you don't bring a kid home who hasn't done his work   you leave him at school to get yelled at  which is what he's got coming   what kind of rules are those   the rules that everybody knows   i'm somebody  i never heard them   lennox  you ready   time to go     she's not here    where is she     you were supposed to watch her    you never said that   because it's obvious  the girl got suspended   she's gone  she ditched the meeting   you know what  you're right   i just said you were right  that was a compliment   okay  she has three places she usually goes after school     i'll just  i'll start there    you want me to help you   yes  please do    nothing   i'm okay    i can work with this kid   wow   is this where you come for your adolescent brooding   you come up here to turn me in   that's not really my style   what is your style   outlaw  cast out by the power brokers   forced to live fe a li in the shadows   oh  kind of like batman  if he'd been demoted to a nanny   nice   aren't you supposed to be at a meeting  at your principal's office right now   why should i  crap goes on there all the time   miss lunt fires the music teacher   completely gets rid of the band  and everybody's afraid to talk about it   i'm tired of life being unfair   how about for once it just be fair   i'd be upset too if my mom and dad bailed on me   i'm talking about miss lunt   if you say so   you don't know anything about me   you're right  i don't   what i really don't know about you is  why you're taking this all out on your aunt   because she's the only person who hasn't bailed on you   look  i know she can get a little skitzy at times   all times   but since we're talking about fair   do you really think it's fair that she has to go down to your school all alone  and eat your big bowl of stink for something that she didn't do    big bowl of stink   what is that   you'll know when you've eaten one   any sign of our lennox   oh  miss lunt  look  i know what lennox did was bad   okay  really really bad   but if any kid has the right to be upset about what life's handed her   look  i'm not trying to excuse lennox   i'm just saying if i was lennox   i'd probably would have done worse by now   in fact  i did   this is pointless without lennox   why don't we just reschedule   you think you could manage to find her by  say  tomorrow afternoon   oh  tomorrow's city council sessions all day   but we take lunch 12 00 to  miss burke  parenting doesn't fit  into nice little schedule boxes   it might be helpful to look not just at what lennox is doing     but at the job you're doing    she's doing okay   i'm sorry i'm late   and i'm sorry about the other day with the poem   and i'm sorry about the stuff that i said   i was mad   and apparently not really at you   but there's no need blame my aunt   she's been getting enough of that from me   at least she's trying  okay  whatever   let's just get to the stink eating part   the what eating part   all right  let's see what you've got   here's a thought  my hip young brother man   try loosening up your your knees a little bit   you're welcome   hey  i heard about all the crap you've been going through   you know  with your wife  going broke   losing your car  your condo   i mean  how can you even walk   oh  sorry  i didn't mean to   no no no  that's all right   i'm aware that my life is an yss of inky black despair   thanksor the pep talk   hey  could you show me how to do that   only if you taped it  i have no idea   mel  ryder  joe   oh  your mom's home   i'm sorry  your   your aunt   i   i meant your aunt     y    so i ate my whole big bowl of stink     whoo    i even went back for seconds   so i'm gonna go brush my teeth now   ah  hands   it was you   you talked her into gog down there   how did you talk her into going down there   people like me     no  really    i paid her 50 bucks   a bribe   that's terrie   not only is that wrong  that's horrible parenting   well  i'm not a parentand neith     n i have 50 bucks    bothno   relax  all right  i wrote lennox a personal check   boing   another very valuable life lesson   so is this yon your youth center right out of college   oh please  thereas outh cente  can i speak to you in the other room     nice knowing you      i'll be fine   you lie  you bbe   is there anything you won't do   ndows   look  burke   i'm just trying to help you out he   i may have played it fand loose   but lennox apologized to that lunt woman  ght   yes  yes  she did
