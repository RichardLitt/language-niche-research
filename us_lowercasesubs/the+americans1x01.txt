the executives happy   you keep the accounts   how have you been  martha   fine  clark  would you like to come in   so  referencing our meeting this evening     obviously  you understand it's been classified top secret  by the the internal affairs division  of the committee to oversee  united states' counterintelligence agencies   do you swear to tell the truth  the whole truth     et cetera  et cetera    i do   great  so  big day at fbi counterintelligence   yes  it was   obviously  we know most of it   but i just want to hear the details from you   because a crisis can provide an opportunity  to uncover the leaks  that we have been looking for in your office   so just tell me what you saw   thank you   well     i i know that a man was kidnapped   he was supposed to speak at a conference this morning   but he didn't show   mm hmm   and did there appear to be a centralized response  to the kidnapping   they were in the secure vault all day   did you get a look inside this time   they don't let me in there  and you know that   i know  i'm sorry   please go on   um     well  the man that they kidnapped was russian   he was someone very important in the kgb  i think     right    by early afternoon   they had tied it to a police report in northeast d c   about a man who was kidnapped last night   and they have a vehicle description   '77 oldsmobile  gold   with d c  plates and bumper stickers   and descriptions of the kidnappers   two men and a woman   one of the men    average height with dark hair   and what specific actions did agent bartholomew order   extra agents were sent to surveil the soviet embassy   agents went out to all the ports and train stations   they thought the russians  would take the man out of the country   how would you best describe agent bartholomew's mood   angry   um     but i i don't want to get him in trouble   no  no  no  no  not at all   our counterintelligence units   they safeguard the security of our nation  martha   so  we have to safeguard their security   tell me what you want next   oh  i don't know   how about    this   oh  i    oh  i don't know  i don't    oh   oh  yes   you mean to tell me  a girl never put her finger up your ass before   that's right   yeah  yeah  now you got it   mm hmm   oh  god   yeah  yeah  yeah  oh   there's something     i mean  if i    if i were gonna see you again     i'd want you to be a little     what   i don't want to hurt your feelings   tell me   but just maybe     stronger  maybe   do you know what the kgb is   um    i've heard of them   well     well  this weekend  i am giving  100 000 cash  to a kgb defector who's coming to town to     the reagan administration revealed today  that after a month long review   it will honor the agreement with iran  that led to the release of the 52 american hostages   so     fbi have the car description with the d c  plates   they haven't connected it  to a stabbing victim at arlington methodist yet   but i don't think it will be long   they're all over our guys at the embassy   who must have made the surveillance   which is why they can't get out  to pick up my message or respond   so  i think we have to assume   with the feds all over them like that   they're on full operational stand down   we should just take care of him ourselves   what's the rush   on an operational stand down   we're authorized to make our own decisions   yes  but why do you want to kill him so badly   i want him out of my house   he's putting us all in danger   and they're just gonna kill him back in moscow anyway   i think we should at least try and finish the mission  the way it was assigned   oh  now you want to complete the mission the way it was assigned   i mean  you should have thought of that before  philip   he shouldn't even be here   well  if you're that worried about him   maybe we could just defect ourselves   at least we'd be millionaires   hmm  we wouldn't have to worry about going to jail  and leaving the kids all alone   a lot of our problems would just go away   pkew   that's very funny   let's see what we hear tomorrow   you sure you don't want to come   haven't even seen the new mall yet   it's a mall   see you  ma   yeah  i know  but this one has fountains and skylights   bye  mom   when we went to dinner last week   wasn't she wearing a sweater with a bunny rabbit on it   oh  my god     playing

another lie      thinkin' 'bout a life of crime      'cause that's what i'll have to do    thanks    to keep me away from you      honey      you know it makes you mad      why is everybody tellin' everybody      what you have done       baby      i know it makes you sad      but when they're handin' out the heartaches      you know you got to have you some      playin' with the queen of hearts

like that   oh  god  i wouldn't want you to   you don't have to be a cowboy to wear cowboy boots   jaden says you do   no one wears cowboy boots anymore  dad   you know  dad  she does have a point there   i met the new neighbors   we're gonna over later to say hello   what  do you think i killed him   just checking   stop   stop   you're my wife   is that right   oh  hi  you came   just for a second  to  uh  bring over brownies  and welcome you to the neighborhood   well  come in  come in   can i offer you guys a drink or        no  no  no  no  no    no   this place is a mess   please  please  don't do anything   we just wanted to bring over the brownies   i'm so sorry   we can come over and help   actually  henry can come over all day tomorrow if you want     oh thank you  um  this is my son matthew    hi   do you know where your father is   uh  he's upstairs   what  do we have visitors already   uh  yeah  this is stan   hey  phil jennings   how you doing  stan beeman   uh  my wife  elizabeth  paige  henry     hi    hi   hey  henry   hello     ooh  are those brownies    homemade     may i    mm   your mom's a good cook   yes   okay     i should've taken them  thank you    mmm     oh  that's a good brownie  hon    yeah   so  this is a pretty good neighborhood we moved into  huh   wouldn't live anywhere else   you know  safe  clean  commute to d c 's not too bad   do you work in the city   i do   what do    what do you do  stan   i'm an fbi agent   fbi  wow  what    what  do you catch bank robbers and stuff   actually  i work in counterintelligence now   counterintel    that's    that's against spies  right   exactly   oh  i'll have to make sure  i don't do any spying around here   oh  you better not  especially for those russians   oh  yeah  they're the    they're the worst  right   oh  they certainly are  philip   they certainly are   it's probably a coincidence   fbi agents have to live somewhere   or they're onto us   and this is what   the end game   they're    they're trying to make us do something stupid   either way  we get rid of timoshev tonight   i almost did it myself this morning   but i thought you'd be pissed   if they are watching us   the last thing you want to do is kill timoshev   that's life in prison  that's no deals  nothing   we take those risks every day  philip   that's what we do   may    maybe there's another way   look  maybe this is an    opportunity   maybe this is the perfect time for us just to think about     living the life we've been living  but just really living it   just    being us   what are you talking about   i'm saying we might be blown   and i'm saying if they are watching us   we can't kill timoshev   i'm also saying we are philip and elizabeth jennings   we have been for a very long time   so why don't we get ahead of this  and why don't we make the first move  and offer ourselves to them   we could get a lot of money      3 million for timoshev   3 million for us   we just get relocated  take the good life   and be happy   are you joking   is this a joke   no   you want to betray our country   well  after everything we've done   i don't think it's such a betrayal   defecting to america   america's not so bad  we've been here a long time   what's    what's so bad about it  you know   the electricity works all the time  food's pretty great     the closet space      is that what you care about     no  i care about everything    not the motherland   i do  but our family comes first   so  paige and henry  uh       what exactly is your plan    we'd have a great life because we would have money   what would you tell them  philip   the truth   you swore   we swore we would never tell them   to let them grow up and live their own lives   they're not to be a part of this   they're not to be a part of this   they will be american  and you can't stand that   i see it every day   i'm not finished with them yet   they don't have to be regular americans     they can be socialists    they're not gonna be socialists     they can be trade union activists    this place doesn't turn out socialists   to know that it was all a lie   they would never speak to us again  philip   and what are we even talking about   there would be no future for any of us     they would kill us all    they'd never find us     they would never find us    have you looked in our trunk    he was a fool   he came back to give speeches   left clues about where he was staying   we'd    we'd be more careful   colonel   come   philip     i'd like you to meet elizabeth   elizabeth     this is philip   pleased to meet you   likewise   i'll leave you two to get acquainted   there is so much to talk about   your lives up until now   philip and elizabeth's lives   not the other ones    those should never be discussed   it would be easy to believe in the elizabeth  who grew up in chicago  illinois  philip   if you don't know any other story   elizabeth  you'll be less likely to make a slip one day  if there is no other version of this man  you're hiding away in the back of your mind   please   sit   would you like some tea   yes  thank you   please   arlington methodist   county liaison   how can i help you   sergeant vaugn  fairfax sheriff department   i'm looking for a john doe     would have come in thursday night   male caucasian  5'10   knife wound to the stomach   let

having car trouble   oh  nothing major    cracked pcv hose   this is an oldsmobile delta  huh   yeah   '77   mm hmm   i wanted the coupe  she wanted the sedan   so we settled on this with a v8   beautiful styling with these stacked headlights   gm can't make these fast enough  huh   yeah  it's a great car   you weren't  uh  tempted  by one of those japanese upstarts  huh   i don't think i'd fit in one   oh  yeah  i hear you on that   oh  great  thanks   you bet   well  i got to get back   of course  after you   what's it called   a piroshki   it's like a meat dumpling  they kind of like them   i kind of like them  too  they're juicy  they're doughy   mr  beeman   this is agent gaad  my former deputy   how you doing   he's detailed  to a cia counterintelligence task force  at langley   he's going to bring them up to speed on timoshev   and hopefully they can help us out   hi  chris   frank   agent beeman  do you think there's any chance  that timoshev is still alive   uh  he's been here about 10 minutes  frank   well  it's my understanding he has some special insight   yeah  my bank robbery assignment   the last three years  i was undercover   undercover  with who   a white supremacist group out of southern arkansas   currently awaiting trial   no shit  you were living it  the whole nine yards   yeah  i barely saw my family   that's one thing we haven't had around here     someone with that mind set   i thought you were here for your good looks   on timoshev  sir     when you're betrayed by one of your own     psst  hey   when you're betrayed by one of your own   you're not inclined to put him out of his misery fast   i would bet the russians would go to considerable lengths  to get him back there  so they can look him in the eye  before they blow his brains out   if you grabbed him but you couldn't get him  out of the country right away  where would you keep him   well  i wouldn't take him to the embassy   i wouldn't want to get near any russians   where we might be looking   um  i wouldn't want to be on the street   as much as i could avoid it   or anywhere i didn't usually go   i would probably make a beeline  to my house  to tell you the truth   it's really the safest place you can be  strange as that may sound   and i would just follow my regular routine   keep him there till the heat died down   well  if he's at somebody's house  we're never gonna find him   no  i wouldn't think so  sir   well  thanks   so  were you  like   burning crosses and shit with those guys  or like   heil hitler    it was a little deeper than that   like    like what   hey  dad  can we get a racing stripe on the oldsmobile   uh  i don't think your mom would like that   why not   she doesn't like new things     the bombs bursting in air      gave proof

american people have elected  a madman as their president   he is expanding their military forces on a massive scale   he is against nuclear arms control agreements   he makes no secret of his desire to destroy us   our war is not so cold anymore  elizabeth   what happens behind enemy lines  will determine the outcome of this struggle   you reported several times over the years about philip   can we trust him   yes  i was wrong   it was nothing    a little     a phase in a person's life   so he is not responsible  for the mess this mission has become   i was the one at fault  general   i am very sorry   don't let that happen again  elizabeth   i may not be able to protect you if you need me   these times bring out the worst in our people   i am fighting now against comrades  in our own

 is there anything new in here   we got a new state police report     anything on the weapon    not yet   our deceased john doe from arlington methodist  is proving very difficult to track down   either he's a kgb directorate  s  officer  who got killed while kidnapping timoshev   or he's a drifter who got stabbed in a fight in arlington   his picture's out  to every police department in the country     but it's a needle in a      don't say  haystack    mr  deputy attorney general   the attorney general and i have just come from the white house   president reagan is outraged that the kgb thinks  it can kidnap someone with impunity on american soil   the president has signed top secret executive order 2579   authorizing the federal bureau of investigation  counterintelligence office  to take all necessary measures to neutralize  soviet directorate  s  sleeper cell agents  in the continental united states   ladies and gentlemen  we are going to war   it is a war that will be fought quietly   by the men and the woman in this room   it will not be short   and it will not be easy   but we have truth and justice on our side   and we will prevail   so  why didn't you tell me about timoshev   we aren't supposed to talk about our other lives   it wasn't really your other life   it happened in training   it was a long time ago  i put it behind me   things are about to change

tell you everything  but     i don't know    when you see it   it just seems    brighter   there's a weakness in the people   i can feel it     why don't you ask him      if he's gonna stay       why
