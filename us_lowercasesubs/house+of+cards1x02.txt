   1  you know what i like about people   they stack so well   let me get this for you     want the paper    no   this is too much   it's not half enough   thanks for opening up for me   any time  day or night  you know that   in a town where everyone's  so carefully reinventing themselves   what i like about freddy  is that he doesn't even pretend to change   ooh  i'm late   every tuesday i sit down  with the speaker and the majority leader  to discuss the week's agenda   well  discuss is probably the wrong word   they talk while i sit quietly  and imaging their lightly salted faces  frying in a skillet   sync   corections by   vasquez must be shitting herself   shitting herself  or walker is shitting himself  and shoveling his shit on her shit   bob  i'm planning on eating   do we have a backup on the docket   you're on that  right  frank   yeah  i'm working with my staff    republicans are gonna ram this  up our ass  i would if i was them   why  even if we squeak it through the house   watch them mangle it in the senate     or filibuster    why  sure  if it looks anything like this   i don't know why walker's  trying to tackle a charging elephant   it's madness   congressmen  sorry to interrupt   but i saw you sitting over here    remy  gentlemen  this is remy danton   remy  this is speaker birch and congress    i'm well aware  mr  speaker  congressman   remy just made partner at glendon hill   glendon hill  great team over there     congratulations    thank you   when was the last time they added a partner   it's been a while   well  they know a winner when they see one   remy was the best press secretary i ever had   why did you let him go   i didn't  they stole him away   what accounts do you have   san corp industries is my main one   i run that account now   anyhow  i'll let you get back to it   sorry again to interrupt   no problem   very nice to meet you both     nice    lobbyists keep getting younger and younger   he's probably making more than all of us combined   gentlemen  this one's on me   i'm gonna track down that check   glendon hill fronts san corp industries   san corp is deep into natural gas   i don't give a hoot about natural gas   but i have 67 deputy whips   and they all need cash to win races   san corp helps me purchase loyalty   and in return they expect mine   it's degrading  i know   but when the tit's that big   everybody gets in line   tell them i'm on top of it   i need more than that   you are well aware that i do not drop the ball  on things like this  remy   promises  frank  secretary of state   argentine and offshore drilling contracts    talk to me when i've solved the problem   don't waste my time when i'm working on solving the problem   when there's billions on the line   i can't not show up   fine  thank you for your diligence   eight figures to you and the d triple c   of yours in your name     i know    don't make them throw money  at your challenger next cycle   you've made your point   have i  i hope so   such a waste of talent   he chose money over power    in this town  a mistake nearly everyone makes   money is the mcmansion in sarasota  that starts falling apart after ten years   power is the old stone building  that stands for centuries   i cannot respect someone who doesn't see the difference   what am i looking at   the williams register     williams    college   september '78   and why am i looking at it   the editorial   not that interesting   michael kern went to williams   check out the masthead   and then there's this   it's thin   the guy's a unicorn  he pisses rainbows     you think we can get traction with this    i think you could   linda vasquez is on the phone   ah  i'm surprised it took her this long   it's only 6 past 9 00   which means she read the herald 3 hours ago  and spent the past 2 1 2 getting reamed by the president   tell her i'm on my way   you were supposed to keep donald in line  you assured me that you    this particular agenda   we got between the mother bear and her cub   it's a setback  that's all   on our first day in office   linda  i've worked with four presidents   setbacks are a dime a dozen with a bill of this size   frank  if you can't control this    i don't take well to being micromanaged  linda   you want to do my job for me and run the white house   good luck  i won't stand in your way   okay  frank  fine  this is yours now   if this thing can't make it to the floor in the first 100 days   then i'll let you explain to the president  why he lied to the american people   i'm gonna get back to work   please do   well  we really should be doing this on a friday  instead of a wednesday   if we do it on a friday     people have the weekend     fine  we'll do it on friday   is all the paperwork ready   some of the more senior people are trickier   there's severance   but we shouldn't run into any legal issues   no  no  we use at will employment contracts  across the board   well  get started first thing friday   i want all of the exit interviews  done by lunch   claire  i just can't help but think  that this is a mistake   we've discussed this already  evelyn   i know  i know  but i just have to say it  for the sake of my conscience   i think that you are dismantling  what we have built over the past ten years   and i    and i think the way you're handling this  is   is cruel   it's not easy  evelyn   but it's necessary   you have always asked me to be honest with you   it's how we work together   i disagree with something  i say it   well  i disagree 100    please  claire  don't do this   i respect your opinion  evelyn   and i appreciate you sharing it with me   but i'm not going to change my mind   friday  then   if that's what you want   this is major reform  a complete overhaul   that would usually take months   well  we only have days  not months   but think about the process  we can't just change    when i ask my colleagues  your bosses   who are the smartest minds in education   out of hundreds  we arrived at you    the six of you in this room   now  i realize it is a difficult task   but we have the opportunity to make history here   and i want all of us to make it together   so good luck  we're counting on you   page 1   these bullet points  reflect the key planks  at the center of our bill   get comfy  this is your home  until we have a presentable first draft   donald  what a morning   i have no idea how they got this   i specifically told my staff  to destroy everything  i can't imagine    it doesn't matter how it happened   we can't make it unhappen  so we have to adapt   don't they realize that this is a first draft   all we have here really is a perception problem   we don't get a second chance at a first impression  donald   you know that  now  look  i'm on your side   but linda is furious   what's she saying   they want to point fingers   at me   i told her we cannot do that   i mean  you are vital to this process   i'm up to here with them  donald    for lying  for turning their back on you   you know  i'm of a mind to say screw it   i'll fall on this grenade myself   just to piss them off   give me john king at cnn   wait  frank  this is not your fault   no  we have to protect your reputation   but you're the man that needs to get the bill through the house   i will   hang on  i will assign it to one of my deputies   quietly manage it  and help guide you through the process   i am not comfortable with this   well  then what do you suggest we do   what a martyr craves more than anything  is a sword to fall on   so you sharpen the blade   hold it at just the right angle   and then 3  2  1    it should be me   it was my bill   no  impossible  donald   education has been your life's work   the truth is my heart is not in this fight   you know me  i'm not a wheeler dealer   i can put my mind to policy   but i'm no good at this brand of politics   well  if not you  then who   it should be you  frank   you're formidable  people respect you   they will follow your lead  let me    let me be on the sidelines for this   well  i could only consider that as an option  if i knew that i could still come to you for counsel   of course  whatever you need   part of me is glad this got leaked   well  it would have been better if it hadn't   but at least people know where i stand   thank you  donald   happy to do it  frank   he has no idea we've got six kids in the next room  already working on a new draft   stamper  but why dampen his mood by telling him   we just gave him a great gift    a chance to fulfill his destiny   write up a statement for blythe    stepping aside  fresh ideas   et cetera  et cetera  and make it dignified   he's a good man   oh  and bring me that williams editorial   after careful thought and discussion with my staff   i am relinquishing my management  of the education reform act   i hope to remain a part of the process   but i won't be working    why did you leak the draft   i'm not exactly sure how it got leaked   but  uh  it does represent    it came from your office  though  correct   uh  we wrote it  but i don't    who'll be managing the bill now   frank underwood   was that your choice   or did the administration    i feel very confident  placing the bill  in frank's capable hands   ms  barnes   how very deep throat of you   well  i can't help you dispatch a president   how about a senator   the editorial on the camp david accords    it is the opinion of this newspaper   that president carter demand israel   withdraw all its citizens  from the gaza strip and west bank     which it has illegally occupied since 1967    illegally occupied   that's quite an incendiary quote  don't you think   for an administration that says  that the middle east is its top foreign policy priority   michael kern   did he personally write the editorial   he was the editor   but did he write it himself   then there's no story   i'm saying it's a question worth asking   and if he denies involvement   he will  let him   this is a man trying to be confirmed  as secretary of state   everything is a story   there's no direct link   i can't get this past messerschmidt   remember this moment when you resisted me   when you said the words  then there is no story    get a good night's sleep  ms  barnes   you have a big day tomorrow   francis   what is this   what does it look like   but the basement is mine   i know  it's not for me   so who's it for   for you   there's a gym in the capitol   which you never use   because i'm a tad busy running the country   but not at home  so now you have no excuse   i want it out   give it a try first   is this your subtle way  of saying that i'm out of shape   no  it's my way of suggesting  you could be in better shape   that sounds both passive aggressive  and condescending   just plain aggressive and true   don't wait up for me   are you going running now   yes  because i couldn't this morning   i had an early meeting   use the monstrosity  it's freezing out   you break it in   it looks positively medieval  doesn't it   and to turn my only sanctuary into a fitness dungeon   i won't have it   it's a stretch   we're not misleading anyone     he was the editor    did you call for a comment   i tried three times  the press secretary said he'd get back to me     he didn't    what about research   you couldn't find anything to echo the editorial   no quotes  no op ed pieces   don't you think if something like that existed   someone would have printed it by now   nobody else has this  lucas   i don't think there's a story here   i'm not saying there's a story  all i'm saying  is that there's a question that needs to be answered   this is a nominee for secretary of state   we have an editorial on palestine and israel   which he didn't write   which we don't know he didn't write   exactly   we don't have to print it   i could just scan the thing   stick it on a site  and tweet the link   but if i did that  some other paper might    whoa  whoa  don't be a bitch   i'll talk to tom   that's all i was asking   we simply can't afford to allow the    we got a guy who's almost perfect   he's a libertarian drug fiend    marinating in a mobile home    shh   i didn't agree with president reagan  on many things   but there was some merit  to the notion of trickle down economics   and i feel there is much merit  to the idea of trickle down diplomacy   those are my lines   vasquez must have given them to him      stalemate between israel and palestine   that success will trickle down  to a hundred other diplomatic dilemmas  between muslims  jews  christians    i'm glad you brought up israel and palestine  because just before we came on the air   i received an advance copy of an article  that's going to be in tomorrow's  washington herald's front page  and was written by zoe barnes   and in it she quotes an editorial  that ran in the williams college register  when you were editor back in september 1978   which called the israeli presence  in the gaza strip and west bank   quote  an illegal occupation     can i see that    sure   did you write those words   illegal occupation    no  i have no memory of this   but you were the editor of the paper   yes  but    so it couldn't have gone out  without your approval   no  of course not  but my staff    somebody else usually wrote the  uh   the  uh   and then we'd vote  and if    did you vote for it   honestly  george  i can't remember   it was 35 years ago   so you're not sure  whether or not you supported these words    i can tell you without a shadow of a doubt  i did not write these words   but were they in line with your thinking at the time   this is ludicrous   that's all we need   him laughing   i know it was a long time ago    nancy  get me dennis mendel of the adl   the middle east is a vital american interest   what you think about the middle east is relevant   you can look at my voting record   every single vote has been in defense of israel    so when did your views change   what i'm saying to you is my    what's important now  george   is how i have voted  while i have represented the great state of colorado    i understand that's your position  but a lot of other people  are going to look at it and think what you thought then  is relevant as well   have you ever changed your views    since college    i'm not the nominee  for secretary of state   uh  even if i did have    it's golden   this has not been my views    it's a bull's eye   what were you saying when you came in   so  ahem  i found a guy  who was on the college editorial staff  when kern was there   this burnout   still pumping mimeographed manifestos  out of a trailer park in the berkshires   you're not planning on talking to him   peter russo   good   sounds like a perfect match   dennis   any chance you're watching stephanopoulos   you look sexy when you're improving  the lives of hardworking pennsylvanians   is it the improving lives   or is it these fetching sweat pants   move that computer out of the way   let me see what that looks like   yeah  it's better with the laptop   fuck off   you're not paying enough attention to me   i pay attention to you all day at the office   hey  you know  i don't think  i've ever seen you brush your teeth before     sure you have    no  i don't think so   i know that you do brush  but i don't think  i've ever actually witnessed it before   well  here it is in all its glory   is that my toothbrush   i don't know  is it   yes  it is     you left it here    peter  gross   oh  come on   we've exchanged plenty of fluids   ohh  hey  no  no  no  no  no  no  no   no  toothpaste   it's not toothpaste  i'm ravished   no   mm   go get it     i have to take this    ohh   this is russo   yeah  right now it's 12 53   okay  okay  okay  okay   i have to go   is everything okay   it's work stuff   what kind of work stuff   congressman wallinski  he wants to go over  the tax incentive stuff we sent him   peter  it's 1 00 in the morning   hey  peter   i have meetings tomorrow  i have a committee hearing   congress will survive without you   address  directions   there's an e ticket in your name   your flight leaves at 6 30     you should head to the airport    this is coming from frank   no  this is coming from no one   you have the flu  and you're calling in sick     what's that    what's what   is that a hickey   are you whoring around again     no  i have a girlfriend    mm   you mean your little office romance   what do you know about that   when it comes to your life  peter  and what i know about it   you should assume that there's no such thing as a secret   stay in touch   you call me on my cell  never at the office   good luck   knock 'em dead  tiger   how are we   overtired  under caffeinated  but we're making progress     less than a week to go    yeah  we'll do our best     you'll what    we'll get it done

the teachers unions are gonna     leave it in     but we could delete it    i'll handle the unions  what else  anything   conjugal visits   i'll get back to work   nancy     coming    what do i have next   constituent calls from 2 10 to 2 35     fundraising until 3 50  deputy caucus at 4 00    the call list     it's on your desk    my briefing for the caucus     next to the call list    have you been in the conference room   have it steam cleaned over the weekend   in the meantime  get those poor kids some febreze or something   it's like a petting zoo   you gotta see this   but were they in line with your thinking at the time   we do not consider the issue of israel  and palestine a laughing matter   and he calls israel illegal   well  he's an anti semite  and he is wrong   we would have grave  grave concerns  about appointing such a man our next secretary of state   it's too easy   roy  hi   my name is peter russo  congressman russo   i'd like to just speak to you for just a     sir   either you're lying  and you can fuck off   or you're telling the truth  and you can absolutely fuck off   i saw your web site   i'm a fan   and i brought you something   hey  babe  put some clothes

tell me   it's the rowing machine     you haven't used it    how do you know i haven't   francis   you know i don't like to be managed   i'm not trying to manage you   i just don't want to outlive you

we share the wealth in this republic   i thought the whole editorial team pitched in   sometimes  not that time  though   but he must have written some of it   no  that was all me   what if people thought he wrote it   oh  fuck that  he's a fraud   nah  he's worse than a fraud  he's a fucking farce   i'll tell you something   he used to be even more of a maniac than i am     chemicals    no

the rockefeller trilateral commission   you bankroll their fucking death squads   it's called fema  it's called alcohol  tobacco  and firearms   nato  border control   you think katrina was incompetence   that was highly orchestrated negligence   look at waco  amnesty international  the a c l u   smokescreens   all of them  blood on their hands   well  exactly   you want me to lie to the people   i want you to spare the people another hypocrite   what's in it for you   poetic justice   oh  come on  you're one of them   can a corporate sellout roll a joint like this       lord knows  i can't change      if i wanted to do this thing   how might i go about that  precisely   how did it go   there were a few tears here and there  and some anger   but nothing unexpected   i'm going to need you to leave us today  too  evelyn   i'm sorry   i just can't have any doubt about the direction i'm taking   you just had me fire 18 people   i know   i sat across from them in this room   and i had to tell each and every one of    i know   i am 59 years old   nobody hires anybody my age   i will write you any kind of recommenda    to do what  bag groceries   what am i supposed to tell my daughter   i'm sorry  evelyn  i truly am   no  you're not  you don't give a fuck   eighteen people  claire   nineteen  if you count me   i have to     i have to call my daughter   i know today has been tough   a lot of your colleagues have left   and i owe you an explanation   many of those who left us today  helped build the c w i  from the ground up   and i'm grateful to them   but it is time for us to evolve   and to accomplish this   we had to make hard choices  and bring in new people   that's what today was about   you have any questions   my door is always open   i'm all good for national and metro   we've got space for political if we need it   janine  anything new on michael kern   the white house is dodging   you can't get anyone on record   not just me   they're shutting all of us down in the briefings   no one is giving an inch  even on background   in the meantime  i'm working on a feature  about the administration's foreign policy agenda   how it shifted from the start of the campaign     increased d o d  spending  and     received  zoe   i can link kern directly to the williams editorial     what    i've got a guy named roy kapeniak  who was on the editorial staff when kern was there   hey  twitter twat  w t f      wait  wait  wait  roy what    kapeniak   a classmate of kern's   i have him on record saying kern wrote every word    of the editorial    let's move this into my office   zoe  lucas   janine   let me   let me  once and for all   say this definitively   i didn't author that editorial   not a single sentence  word  comma  or period   if memory serves me  it was mr  kapeniak who wrote it   why on earth he's trying to claim that i did is beyond me   let me further say that i'm a strong supporter of the state of israel   as the most stable country in the region    and our strongest ally      it's frank underwood for cathy      in any peace process   because without the stability of israel   there can be no palestine   cnn right now    without israel there can be no palestine      i've got it on    i would remind senator kern  that there was a palestine long before there was an israel   his comments are not only ignorant  they are racist   get ready  cathy  things are about to move very quickly        his understanding of the middle east     okay        is so out of sync with reality      i'm ready   hey     peter  no  stop    uh  not now   hey  hey  where have you been   oh  god  you're fucking high     no  i     yes  you are  look at your eyes   oh  please  just lay off   you promised me it wouldn't be like this   cancel whatever i have for the rest of the day   kern is out   they're tossing him   technically  that would draw himself  but yes   can i say  a source close to the white house    no  you let this story play out on its own time   they'll announce in the morning   i'm sorry  if not that  what story are we talking about   catherine durant   as soon as kern withdraws  you say she'll be the replacement     is that true    it will be after you write it   roy kapeniak was you   you might very well think that  i couldn't possibly comment   you found him  you had him call me   kapeniak and kern were appetizers  miss barnes   catherine durant is the meal   say that name  catherine durant   say it over and over   tomorrow afternoon  write it down   and then watch that name come out of the mouth  of the president of the united states   this is where we get to create   don't miss your train  miss barnes   it's the last one tonight   zoe barnes with the washington herald now reporting   quoting a source close to the president   as saying that senator catherine durant  will likely be the new nominee for secretary of state  after michael kern's withdrawal earlier this week   the white house has remained silent on whether the president  will tap durant for a nomination   but a national zogby poll  shows wide support for durant across party lines   catherine durant has served ten years on the senate foreign relations committee   made numerous diplomatic missions to south america     we can place our faith in her  knowing that we have a responsible   experienced  brilliant woman representing our interests abroad   middle of the road  team player  strong in defense   if there's a woman that can work with the joint chiefs  she's the one   durant is the way to go  it's a no brainer   the president should stop this pageant and simply make the call   why are we still talking about  if they're going to nominate durant   why don't they just do it already  so we can all stop talking about ifs  and start talking about when and what  and how durant's going to shape up foreign policy     so  history   history   i'm very impressed  frank   good  with your go ahead  i'll start the mock up   have birch and rasmussen seen this   not yet  i wanted you to be the first to have a look   i'll schedule a time for you to fill in the president   oh  no  no  no  that is your turf  linda  you should do that     thank you  frank    my pleasure  thank you     i so apologize for everything     no  no  no  n    it's not necessary   now for the real meeting   so what is happening with michael kern   oh  it's a total nightmare   you know who you're gonna tap next   frank  we still need you in the house    no  no  no  i wouldn't dream of it   we've got our education bill  i was just curious   somehow the rumor is flying around  that we're gonna nominate catherine durant     i'm sure you've noticed    is the rumor true   well  we weren't considering her at first   but the president asked me to have her vetted  in case we wanna go that route     interesting    what do you think   well  she wouldn't be my first choice    who would be your first choice   she campaigned hard against us in the primaries     that's my reservation    but you'd show yourself above party politics   and i know she'd work all the harder for it   decent experience  respect across the aisle   so you think we can seriously consider her   it's not the worst idea in the world     where are you getting this shit    what     your stories  who are you fucking    i was just      nobody    oh  come on   you're a metro scrub  and now look at you   you'd have to be fucking somebody important   i'm just doing my job  janine   excuse me   all set     is this your first remote    yeah  it's my first time   right into the camera  don't shift in your seat   and there's no reason to speak above a conversational volume     the mic will pick you up  you all ready    yeah   all right  don't forget to breathe   five  four     we'd like to welcome zoe barnes from the washington herald   zoe  thank you for joining us   i'm very glad to be here  thank you for having me   you broke the education bill  the kern editorial  and now durant   i'm just thrilled to be reporting news that matters   and it's truly been a team effort   everyone at the herald pitched in   but  yes  a lot of firsts   first national story  first     thank you   calling it a night   see you tomorrow  sir   but  yes  a lot of firsts   first national story   first front page byline   first tv interview   i would wave to my mom  but the cameraman said not to shift in my seat   what a roller coaster   it really is too bad  kern was a good man     and now catherine durant    yes   right place  right time  i suppose     we like her  don't we    very much   question is  does she like san corp as much as we like her   i would say that that is a very good bet   but then again  i'm not a betting man     no  you always like a sure thing    when it avails itself     good night  remy    good night  frank     see you around    hopefully less and less now   oh  no  i charged the wrong thing     what did
