big   okay  i'm on it   what's your name     sayid    sayid  i'm on it  sayid   i might throw up on you   you're doing fine   you don't seem afraid at all   i don't understand that   well   fear's sort of an odd thing   when i was in residency   my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a 16 year old kid   a girl   and at the end  after 13 hours  i was closing her up  and i     i accidentally ripped her dural sac   shredded the base of the spine where all the nerves come together   membrane  stenos tissue   so it ripped open   nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta   spinal fluid flowing out of her  and i     and the terror was just so    crazy   so real   and i knew i had to deal with it   so i just made a choice   i'd let the fear in  let it take over  let it do its thing   but only for five seconds  that's all i was gonna give it   so i started to count        then it was gone   i went back to work  sewed her up  and she was fine   if that had been me   i think i would have run for the door   well  i don't think that's true   you're not running now   fate  you'd think they would have come by now   what  who   anyone   as if i'm gonna start eating chocolate   shannon  we may be here for a while   the plane had a black box  idiot   they know exactly where we are  they're coming   i'll eat on the rescue boat   i'll eat on the rescue boat     hungry    yeah  thanks   any more  uh  you know  baby stuff   no  i'm    i'm okay     well  hang in there    yeah  you too   you sure you're warm enough       do you think he's gonna live   do you know him   he was sitting next to me   we must have been at about  hit an air pocket  and dropped maybe      the turbulence was     i blacked out   i didn't   i saw the whole thing   i knew that the tail was gone  but i     couldn't bring myself to look back   and then the     the front end of the plane broke off   well  it's not here on the beach   neither is the tail   we need to figure out which way we came in   why   'cause there's a chance we could find the cockpit   if it's intact  we might be able to find the transceiver   and we could send a signal  and help the rescue party find us   how do you know all that   took a couple flying lessons   it wasn't for me   i saw some smoke   just through the valley   if you're thinking about going for the cockpit   i'm going with you   i don't know your name     i'm kate    jack   what was that   that was weird  right   is that vincent   it's not vincent   did anybody see that    yeah   boone   terrific   so how's the drink   it's good   that wasn't a very strong reaction   well  it's not a very strong drink   just don't tell anyone   this of course breaks some critical faa regulations   excuse me   sir  excuse me   i guess he really had to go   sir  excuse me   ladies and gentlemen   the pilot has switched on the  fasten seatbelts  sign   please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts   it's normal   oh  i know   i've just never been a very food flyer   my husband keeps reminding me that planes  want to be in the air   well  he sounds like a very smart man   i'll be sure and tell him that when he gets back from the bathroom   well  i'll keep you company until he does   don't worry   it's gonna be over   it sounded like an animal   that sound that it made   i keep thinking that there was something really familiar about it     where are you from    the bronx     might be monkeys    sure  it's monkey island     you ready   kate  you showed me where the smoke was  i can get there myself   i'm coming   well  you're gonna need better shoes   whatever it was   it wasn't natural   does anyone have any sunblock    yeah  i do   so   i was just looking inside the fuselage   it's pretty grim in there   do you think we should do something about the  uh     b o d y s   what are you spelling  man  bodies   b o d i e s   that sounds like a good idea   no  they'll deal with it when they get here   i'm gonna go out and look for the cockpit   see if we can find a transceiver  to send a distress signal  help the rescue team   you're gonna need to keep an eye on the wounded   if the guy in the suit wakes up   try to keep him calm   but don't let him remove that piece of shrapnel  you understand   yeah  got it  what about the guy with the leg  the tourniquet   stopped the bleeding  i took it off last night   he should be all right   yeah  cool  good job   i'll come with  i want to help   nah  i don't need any more help   no  it's cool  don't really feel like standing still  so     excellent   can i ask you something   me   i'd be thrilled   i've been waiting   have we ever met anywhere   no  that would be unlikely     i look familiar  though  right    yeah     can't quite place it    no  i can't   yeah  i think i know   you do    you all  everybody  you all  everybody   you never heard that song     i've heard it  i just don't know what the hell   that's us    driveshaft   look  the ring   second tour of finland   you never heard of driveshaft     the band    yeah  the band     you were in driveshaft    i am  i play bass     serious    yeah  charlie   track 3  you know  i do backing vocals   my friend beth would freak  she loves you guys   give me beth's number  i'll call her  i'd love to     hey    you ever heard of driveshaft    you all  everybody   you all  every   body  we

weather   is this    guys   i'm telling you  you don't wanna go in there  there's too many bodies   there it is again   oh my god   well  let's do this     let's get this trans     transceiver    transceiver thing and get out of here   come on  come on   you okay   yeah  you   yeah   i'm fine   charlie's fine  by the way  i'm okay   hey  you don't have to come up here   no  i'm good   so  what does a transceiver look like   like a complicated walkie talkie   hey  can you hear me   i need that water   here  here you go     how many survived    at least 48   does anything feel broken   no  no  just my head    it's a little dizzy  that's all   it's probably a concussion     how long has it been    16 hours      has anybody come    not yet   six hours in   our radio went out   no one could see us   we turned back to land in fiji   by the time we hit turbulence   we were a thousand miles off course   they're looking for us in the wrong place   we have a transceiver   good  good  that's what we were hoping     listen  you shouldn't try to move    no  no  i'm okay   the transceiver's right there   it's right there   where's charlie   it's not working   charlie   what were you doing in
