christian man  you will entertain on its own fuckin' merits   does it involve letting you go   i know two scores  mr  bullock   that we could make in transit  without moving  people with cash on hand   and if once we hit deadwood  and you didn't want to have anything to do with me   we'd never speak again   we would meet as strangers the rest of our fuckin' lives   now     you tell me what you think of that  sir   it don't appeal to me   get the fuck out of here for a moment  would you  sir   byron samson's comin' for him   sir  would you please get the fuck out  till we have finished our

begun to imagine it   it was a near thing till the end   i had to go all our 20 000 to turn farnum away   oh well   i'll have to write the bank to renew my credit   of course they'll contact father   well     i expect that's inevitable   wild bill hickok is here   i'm sure he's going to prospect too     how much do you want    well  we agreed on 30      30  of 20 would be six    mm hmm   so i want the 6 000   what's 30  of 14 000     what the fuck  al    who told you to take him to 20   well  i could feel that he had more in him   it was just a spontaneous fucking feeling  and i knew that there was more to get   and you thought six more would be the jackpot  take him from 14 to 20   oh jesus christ  you know  if you had further plans   i wish you'd have just said something to me   should i tell you when i plan to take a shit tomorrow  or would that be none of your fucking business   so    14 000   what is that now    4 200   what the fuck arrangement do you suggest now     what do you suggest    oh jesus christ almighty   you get in a mood like this and i just as soon as not even discuss it   look  let me just have 500  you know   and we'll discuss the rest of it some other fucking time   cash or credit at the tables   fucking time of trial  the fucking english in you comes out  fine   i'll have the 500 at the fucking tables then  jesus christ almighty     are we holding markers    you're holding markers  all right   you've been holding markers against my kind for the past several centuries   across both sides of the fucking water  how the fuck do i know    ask dority  he'll know better than me   credit it against the fucking markers   but just let me hold 20  in fucking cash     tell dan to give you 20    and a piece of fucking pussy   tell dan  then tell him to come see me   and thanks for stepping in on the side of right and fucking justice   you deaf dumb bastard   i tell you  al  you could have knocked me over with a feather  when he took him to 20   did you see me struggling to stay on the path   my wife and children are in louisville  kentucky   i'm saving to bring them out   days i dig on the foster's water ditch  and nights i watch folk's goods like i'm going to do for yours   schedule like that seems like you'll have 'em here in no time   then sabbaths i preach christ crucified and raised from the dead   i'm from etobicoke  ontario     so you were born in canada    i come to montana when i was 17     that's when i met up with mr  star    is that so   i was born in austria   austria  wonderful where people come from   i was born in austria and then i grew up in chillicothe  ohio   and then you partnered with mr  bullock in montana   that's where we partnered up   the lord is our final comfort   but it's a solace having friends   i know that from past experience   you sure sold up a storm here tonight  didn't you     we did all right    we'll be a few hours  mr  smith   we want to look around the camp   i will watch your goods as if they were my own     thank you  mr  smith    thank you   whoa   i seen a terrible thing tonight   what'd you see   i seen white people dead and scalped and     men  women  and children with their arms and legs hacked off   where  how many dead   well  it was a whole family on the road to spearfish   oh my god  it's them heathen bloodthirsty savages     how many was it died    it was the whole family  they was     hacked and mutilated   the parents  two children   the metz family took the spearfish road  going home to minnesota   then that was probably them then   they had three children  were there three   there could've been three 'cause     they was all hacked    and spread around   rest their souls     rest their souls    yeah   you probably need a drink   you called my bluff  hickok   i was trying to run one  whoa   wait on mary  i got a third eight under there   three eights wins  your pot     oh i absolutely did not realize that    your chips   here i am thinking i'm fucking bluffing the third eight   and i mistakenly outdraw the greatest gunfighter in the world   meaning the third eight     what    saying you outdrew me   you meant the third eight   well  what else would i have meant   say it   then we'll play cards   third eight's what i meant     deal    ante's up  same again   jesus christ  can we shake hands or something   relieve the atmosphere   i mean  how stupid do you think i am   i don't know  i just met you   the paradox is the massacre at little big horn  signaled the indians' death throes  mr  utter   history has overtaken the treaty which gave them this land   well  the gold we found has overtaken it   i believe within a year  congress will rescind the fort laramie treaty   deadwood and these hills will be annexed  to the dakota territory  and we who have pursued our destiny  outside law or statute  will be restored to the bosom of the nation   and    that's what i believe     does bosom mean tit    same thing   ain't nothing against y'all fellas   but i'd as soon do my drinking and getting a piece of ass   first you want people to know about that family   yeah  well  what harm is it in me meeting my needs  before i circulate the news   what if the third child is alive   you listen  mister  it was a massacre   i'm the one who saw it  and there ain't no one was alive   did you see the massacre or not   i told you i got there afterwards   so by then  the child could've got away  from where you saw those other bodies   or the child could've been hiding  and so afraid of who you might be  it didn't call out   you listen to me  i ain't going back out there again tonight   so you mind your own goddamn business   you're saying a family is massacred by indians  on the road to spearfish and one child may still be alive    and it's no one's concern      what's this about a massacre   oh  for christ's sake  god damn it   i ain't going out there again tonight  after i just made camp with my scalp by sheer dumb fucking luck   ride out and show us the place   i'll guarantee your scalp     you riding    yeah     we'll ride    may i ride   i'd be honored to ride  infirmities permitting   here we go   wild bill fucking hickok   you were a marshal in kansas   yeah     and you    montana     come to your senses now    yes  sir   the fella's story on this don't hold water   no  it don't     what'd you give driscoll
