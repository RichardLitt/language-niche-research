 plastics apparently talked to the president   the white house doesn't want us mentioning oil or cornstarch or plastic   just wing it   this has been pencil fucked completely   uh  yes  front and back  very little romance   that's the entire speech  okay   what's left here  i've got  hello   and i have    preposions   well  you could talk about your boat     or something like that    sure  talk

all kidding aside   i am reminded tonight  of the late senator david reeves   he died   he's    he's dead now   and i remember dear david  talking to the president and myself  about the absurdity of allowing  multiple filibusters on a single bill   and     politics is about people   it's about people     uh      is your guy gonna be tweeting about this   okay  well  let me put it this way  sam

our own retard   uh  so     i know  i know  i know what i said   it's the use of the word  retard      it's just not      but it was joke  it was joke   and then everything went silent   if i could  i think it would behoove you to make an apology  as soon as possible  in which case i can get someone in your office  from an appropriate mental health charity     who the fuck is pretty boy  who the
