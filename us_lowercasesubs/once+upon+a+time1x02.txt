where are they   it's an old book  stuff's missing   what do you care   i care because you think i am some evil queen   and that hurts me  henry  i am your mother   no  you're not   well  then  who is   that woman you brought here   i don't like what she or this book is doing to you   thankfully both are no longer an issue   what       hey  how about that   guess those rusty old innards  finally straightened themselves out  huh   yes  how about that  indeed     did you know the honey crisp tree  is the most vigorous and hardy of all apple trees   it can survive temperatures as low as 40 below  and keep growing  it can weather any storm   i have one that i've tended to since i was a little girl     and to this day i have yet to taste anything  more delicious than the fruit it offers   thanks   i'm sure you'll enjoy them on your drive home   actually  i'm gonna stay for a while   i'm not sure that's such a good idea   henry has enough issues   he doesn't need you confusing him   all due respect  madame mayor   the fact that you have now threatened me  twice in the last 12 hours makes me want to stay more   since when were apples a threat   i can read between the lines   sorry  i just want to make sure henry's okay   he's fine  dear   any problems he has are being taken care of   what does that mean   it means i have him in therapy   it's all under control   take my advice  ms  swan   only one of us knows what's best for henry   yeah  i'm starting to think you're right about that   it's time for you to go   or what   don't underestimate me  ms  swan   you have no idea what i'm capable of   i shall destroy your happiness     if it is the last thing i do   hey       would you like something to drink   do i look like i need a drink   i was only trying to help   thank you   now that was an awfully big threat   destroy everyone's happiness   how do you plan on accomplishing that   the dark curse   are you sure  your majesty   you said you'd never use it   you made a deal when you gave away that curse   you traded it away   she won't be happy to see you   since when do i care  about anyone else's happiness but mine   prepare the carriage   we're going to the forbidden fortress    how are you  dear    i'm doing fine   are you   if it were me   i'd be simply tortured  watching that flake of snow so happy   weren't you about the same age when you were to be married  before she ruined it all  yes  you were   yes  it was about the same age you were  when that sleeping beauty got the best of you   my dear maleficent   i soldiered on  as you will  too  hopefully   enough games  you know why i'm here   i need my curse back   it's not yours anymore  a deal's a deal   i traded you my sleeping curse   which failed  undone by a simple kiss   now please  return what's mine   the dark curse  really   you must know that not even its unholy power  can bring your loved one back from the dead   have you considered a pet   they can be quite comforting   the only comfort for me is snow white's suffering   well  it's her wedding night   i doubt she's suffering right now   i need that curse   i know you keep it hidden in the orb above your staff   hidden for the good of all  old friend   whoever created that monstrosity  makes the two of us look positively    moral   who did give it to you   where i got it's none of your concern     hand it back   must we do this   alas  we must           no      love is weakness  maleficent   i thought you knew that   if you're going to kill me  kill me   why would i do that   you're my only friend   don't do this  this curse     there are lines even we shouldn't cross   all power comes with a price   enacting it will take a terrible toll   it will leave an emptiness inside you     a void you will never be able to fill   so be it   who among us is tired of losing   that's why i called you here     to put an end to our misery   today we claim victory     and move to a new  better realm     a place where we can finally win   and we'll be happy   i guarantee it   but first   i need something from you     a lock of hair from those with the darkest souls   you must trust me  because if you don't   there are other ways      a wise decision   all that remains is the final ingredient     a prized heart     from my childhood steed     the glorious beast whose passing will fuel our victory   let my wrath be unleashed         yeah  you really unleashed something there     the  mirror  strikes again   you're late   sorry  i wanted to bring you the latest edition   i assure you it's one of my better hatchet jobs   that's not what i asked for   what'd you find out about her   well  the truth be told  there wasn't much   she spent a lot of time in foster homes     uh  she got into some trouble when she was a kid   but the details are locked up pretty tight   since then  she's clean  bounced around all over   the only thing i really learned  was that she doesn't like to sit still   that appears to have changed     did you know that  um  she had henry while she was in phoenix   how'd he wind up here in maine   so if i'm understanding you correctly     you found nothing of value   which means you have no value  sidney   do you know what i do with things that hold no value to me   i throw them away   i'll keep looking   here you go   thank you   but i did not order that   yeah  i know  you have an admirer   ah  so you decided to stay   observant    important for a cop   it's good news for our tourist business   it's bad for our local signage   it's    it's a joke   because you ran over our sign   look  the cocoa was a nice gesture   and i am impressed that you guessed  that i like cinnamon on my chocolate   'cause most people don't  but i am not here to flirt   so thank you  but no  thank you   i didn't send it   i did   i like cinnamon  too   don't you have school   duh  i'm 10  walk me   so what's the deal with you and your mom   it's not about us  it's about her curse   we have to break it  luckily  i have a plan   step one    identification  i call it operation cobra   cobra  that has nothing to do with fairy tales   exactly  it's a code name to throw the queen off the trail   so everyone here is a fairy tale character     they just don't know it   that's the curse   time's been frozen  until you got here   hey   where'd you get that   your mom   don't eat that   o okay   uh  all right  what about their pasts   they don't know  it's a haze to them   ask anyone anything  and you'll see   so for decades  people have been walking around in a haze   not aging  with screwed up memories   stuck in a cursed town that kept them oblivious   i knew you'd get it  that's why we need you   you're the only one who can stop her curse   because i'm the daughter of snow white and prince charming     yes  and right now we have the advantage   my mom doesn't know that   i took out the end  the part with you in it   see  your mom is snow white   oh  kid   i know the hero never believes at first   if they did  it wouldn't be a very good story   if you need proof  take them  read them  but whatever you do   don't let her see these pages  they're dangerous   if she finds out who you are     it would be bad     i gotta go   but i'll find you later and we can get started   i knew you'd believe me   i never said i did   why else would you be here   it's good to see his smile back   i didn't do anything   you stayed   so does the mayor know you're still here   oh  she knows  what is her deal   she is not a great people person   how did she get elected   she's been mayor as long as i can remember   no one's ever been brave enough to run against her   she inspires quite a bit of     well  fear   i'm afraid i only made that worse by giving henry that book   now he thinks she's the evil queen   who does he think you are   oh  it's silly   i just got five minutes of silly  lay it on me   snow white   who does he think you are   i'm not in the book   can i ask you a favor   regina mentioned the kid's in therapy   do you know where i can find the doctor     hey   emma swan  i was  uh  just reading about you   let me guess     you're here for help with a little post traumatic stress   that diagnosis was free  by the way    no  i'm here about henry   i'm sorry  i i i really shouldn't     i know  i'm sorry  just tell me something   this fairy tale obsession    what is causing it   i mean  he thinks everyone is a character in his book   that's     crazy   i hope you don't talk that way in front of him   the word  crazy  is  um  quite damaging  these stories     they're his language   he has no idea how to express complex emotions   so he's translating as best he can   this is how he communicates   and he's using this book to help deal with this problems   but he got the book a month ago   has he been seeing you longer than that   um    yes  he has   so it's regina  isn't it   uh  his mother is a    very complicated woman   and  uh  over the years   her attempts to try and bring henry closer  have only backfired   why don't you take a look at the file   um  see what i mean   why are you doing this   well  he talks about you a lot   and you're very important to him   thank you   just  uh  see that i get it back  okay   ms  swan   for the sake of the boy   be careful how you handle his belief system   destroying his imagination would be    be devastating     you were right  she was just here   did she take the file   yes   how    how did you know she was gonna come here   because i'm the one who gave her the idea   hey there   if you're concerned about the  do not disturb  signs   don't worry  i've left them alone   actually  i'm here about dr  archibald hopper   he mentioned you got into a bit of a row with him earlier   no   i was shocked  too   given your shy  delicate sensibilities   he says you demanded to see henry's files  and when he refused  you came back and stole them   he gave them to me   alas  he's telling a different tale   may i check your room  or must i get a search warrant     is this what you're looking for   well  you're very accommodating   i'm afraid  ms  swan  you're under arrest      again   you know i'm being set up  don't you    and who  may i ask  is setting you up     where carbon dioxide and water synthesize       may i speak with my son   we're in the middle of a lesson  is it important   do you think i'd be here if it wasn't    henry  sweetie  i have some bad news   the woman who you brought here     she's been arrested   she broke into dr  hopper's office and stole his files   she's a con woman   she's trying to learn about us  in order to take advantage of us   that's why she's sticking around   i'm sorry   no  you're not   i know you think otherwise   but all i'm doing is trying to protect you   this is gonna be good for us  you'll see   things will be better   i gotta get back to class   you know the shrink is lying  right    to the right  please  why would he lie   the mayor put him up to this     she's gotta have something on him   he's terrified of her like everyone else in this     town   to the left   regina may be       a touch intimidating   but i don't think she'd go as far as a frame job   how far would she go  what does she have her hands in   well  she's the mayor  she has her hands in everything   including the police force     hey   henry  henry  what are you doing here   his mother told him what happened   of course she did   henry  i don't know what she said     you're a genius   what   i know what you were up to   you were gathering intel     for operation cobra   i'm sorry  i'm a bit lost   it's need to know  sheriff  and all you need to know  is that ms  blanchard's gonna bail her out   you are   why   i  uh  trust you   well  if you can uncuff me  i have something to do       what the hell are you doing   picking apples   you're out of your mind   no  you are  if you think a shoddy frame job's enough  to scare me off  you're gonna have to do better than that   you come after me one more time   i'm coming back for the rest of this tree   because  sister  you have no idea what i'm capable of   your move   maybe it's for the best   the forces you're summoning are darker than we can conceive   tect me   it's what i do   i know   you're the only one who does   helping you is my life   well  then help me understand why this curse isn't working   if you want to know that  then you need to go back  to the person who gave it to you in the first place   revenge is a dark and lonely road  once you go down it     there is no heading back   what is there for me to head back to    it's just us  dearie    you can show yourself         ahh   that curse you gave me     it's not working   oh  so worried   so  so worried     like snow and her lovely new husband   what   they paid me a visit as well   they were very anxious  about you and the curse   what'd you tell them   the truth    that nothing can stop the darkness     except  of course  their unborn child   you see   no matter how powerful   all curses can be broken   their child is the key   of course the curse has to be enacted first   tell me what i did wrong   for that  there's a price   what do you want   simple   in this new land   i want comfort   i want a good life   fine  you'll have an estate  be rich   i wasn't finished  there's more   there always is with you    yeah   in this new land   should i ever come to you for any reason   you must heed my every request   you must do whatever i say   so long as i say     please   you do realize that should i succeed   you won't remember any of this   oh  well  then    what's the harm   deal     what must i do to enact this curse   you need to sacrifice a heart   i sacrificed my prized steed     a horse  this is the curse to end all curses   you think a horse is gonna do   great power requires great sacrifice   the heart you need  must come from something far more precious   tell me what will suffice   the heart of the thing you love most   what i love most died because of snow white   is there no one else you truly love   this curse isn't going to be easy   vengeance never is  dearie   you have to ask yourself a simple question     how far are you willing to go   as far as it takes   then please stop wasting everyone's time and just do it   you know what you love   now go kill it   ms  swan   oh  my  this is terribly awkward   i need to ask you to leave   i'm afraid we have a no felons rule   it turns out it's a city ordinance   let me guess    the mayor's office just called to remind you   you can gather your things   but i need to have your room key back     she destroyed city property   i want her arrested   again   what are you waiting for   i'm just not convinced arresting her's the right plan     and i'm not talking about your tree   we both know she didn't steal those files   oh  do we  i mean  she looked pretty shocked  when i leveled the charges against her   guess she doesn't like being caught   or because she was set up   and if she was  that means dr  hopper was lying   and if he's lying  that means that someone asked him to   are we really confident  that the man's conscience won't eventually get the best of him   i think your schoolboy crush is clouding your judgment   remember  i made you sheriff   and i can take it away just as easily   you want me to arrest her again  i will   good   but she's gonna keep coming at you   and i know you    you're gonna keep coming at her  and you will do whatever it takes to get her out of here  and you may succeed   no  i will succeed   he's my son  it's what's best for him   i know that's what you believe  okay  but if this escalates   it seems to me the only one who will get hurt is henry       yeah    ms  swan   i'd be happy to continue demonstrating my power   but am i right in guessing your resolve to stay is only growing   you have no idea   well  then  i think it's time we made peace   why don't you drive over to my office   or walk    whatever suits you   i'd like to start by apologizing   ms  swan   what   i just have to accept the reality  that you want to be here     that's right  i do   and that you're here to take my son from me   okay  let's be clear   i have no intention of taking him from anyone   well  then  what are you doing here   i know i'm not a mother    i think that's pretty self evident     but i did have him  and i can't help it     he got in my head and i want to make sure he's okay   the more you try to push me out  the more i want to be here   especially after seeing how troubled he is   you think he's troubled   well  he's in therapy   and i only got through a couple pages of his shrink's notes  before you had me arrested  but putting all that aside     he thinks everyone in this town is a fairy tale character   and you don't   how can i   the poor kid can't tell the difference  between fantasy and reality  and it's only getting worse   it's crazy    you think i'm crazy   henry   how long was he there   long enough   you knew he would be here   did i know that my son comes to my office  every thursday at precisely 5 00 p m   so i can take him for dinner before his therapy session   of course i did   i'm his mother   your move   you have no soul   how in the hell did you get like this     what happened  did you get your answer   what's going on   your majesty   your majesty     did rumplestiltskin tell you what you needed to know   yes   and   i'm not sure i should say   i'm conflicted   how bad is it   maybe i can help   i have to cut out the heart of the thing i love most   me   daddy  i don't know what to do   my dear     please     you don't have to do this   i have to do something   then move past this   i know this may sound self serving   but you don't need to enact the curse   but i can't keep living like this   what snow did to me  what she took from me     it's eating me alive  daddy   her very existence mocks me   she must be punished   what's     if the price is a hole that will never be filled   why do it   stop worrying about snow white and start over   we can have a new life   but what kind of life   all i've worked for  all i've built  will be gone   my power will disappear  they already think i'm nothing   power is seductive  but so is love   and you can have that again   i just want to be happy   you can be  of this i'm sure   i believe  given the chance   we can find happiness together   but the choice is yours   i think you're right    i can be happy   just not here       i'm sorry     hey   just wanted to say thank you and  um   pay you back the bail money     you look like you need to talk   cinnamon   oh  i'm sorry  i should have asked   it's a little quirk of mine  do you mind   not at all   no  thanks   when you bailed me out  you said that you trusted me   why   it's strange    ever since you arrived here   i've had the oddest feeling like we met before   i mean  i know it's crazy   i'm starting to reevaluate my definition of crazy   for what it's worth  i think you're innocent   of breaking and entering or just in general   whichever makes you feel better     doesn't really matter  what anyone thinks i did or didn't do   i'm leaving   thank you for everything  but i think it's for the best   if i stay  henry's only gonna keep getting hurt   what happens if you go   i think the very fact that you want to leave  is why you have to stay   you care about him   who will protect henry if you won't    are you sure you don't want to talk about it   you know  that umbrella is kind of my good luck charm   is that why you think i'm jiminy cricket   i don't think you're anyone       ms  swan   look  i can explain  the mayor forced me    i know   don't worry about it  i get it  henry  i'm sorry   i don't want to talk to you   ms  swan  if she knew you were here    to hell with her   henry  there is one simple reason i stayed here    you   i wanted to get to know you   you think i'm crazy   no  i think the curse is crazy  and it is     but that doesn't mean that it isn't true   it is a lot to ask anyone to believe in   but there are a lot of crazy things in this world   so what do i know  maybe it is true   but you told my mom     what she needed to hear   what i do know     is that if the curse is real  the only way to break it  is by tricking the evil queen     into thinking that we are nonbelievers   'cause that way  she's not on to us   isn't that what operation cobra was all about   throwing her off the trail   brilliant   i read the pages   and  henry  you're right    they are dangerous   there is only one way to make sure that she never sees these   now we have the advantage     i knew you were here to help me   that's right  kid  i am   and nothing  not even a curse   is gonna stop that       i love you  daddy     what a mess   not for long   what can i do for you  mr  gold   i was just in the neighborhood  thought i'd pop by   lovely to see you in such high spirits    well  it's been a good day   i just rid the town of an unwanted nuisance   emma swan  really   yes  i imagine she's halfway to boston by now   i wouldn't bet on that   i've just seen her strolling  down the main street with your boy   thick as thieves  they looked   what   perhaps you should have come to me   if ms  swan is a problem you can't fix   i'm only too happy to help  for a price  of course     i'm not in the business of making deals with you anymore   to which deal are you referring   you know what deal   oh  right  yeah   the boy i procured for you   henry   did i ever tell you what a lovely name that was   how ever did you pick it   did you want her to come to town   you wanted all this to happen  didn't you   your finding henry wasn't an accident  was it   what ever do you mean   where did you get him   do you know something   i've no idea what you're implying   i think you do   who is this woman  his mother  this    emma swan   i would say you think you know exactly who she is   i really must be going   tell me what you know about her   i'm not gonna answer you  dear   so i suggest you excuse me    please
