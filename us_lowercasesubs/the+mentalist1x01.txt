know that     if she hadn't had left a diary     but she did  though   be reasonable  this is my case   your case   red john's mine   red john doesn't belong to anyone   he belongs to me   it's not my call  rules are rules   come back next week   don't let this man past   boss   we have gregory tannen   caucasian  male  43  single   we haven't opened him up yet  but burn marks     sorry i went over your head   i'll redeem myself  i promise   you want redemption  be silent   okay  i can learn to do that   sorry   the burn marks here indicate that the victim was subdued with a stun gun    standard civilian model by the look of it   death appears to be caused by several blows to the back of the skull consistent  with a bloodied golf club found at the scene   female is alison randolph    they were found at her listed residence   t o d looks to be early saturday evening   on alison  we have the same stun gun marks   followed by binding with tight black plastic ligatures   frenzied cutting and stabbing assault of the  textbook red john   who found the bodies   this one's husband  coming home from the airport sunday morning with his brother     he's a pro golfer    oh  yeah   price randolph   what's her deal with him  do we know   uh  he's on file as one of her physicians     making a house call    lovers   no  this one's gay   dr  wagner might know what their relationship was   he's here to make the formal i d    okay   dr  wagner   i'm agent teresa lisbon  california bureau of investigation   what's your connection to the victims   i work with gregory     dr  tannen and  and the randolph family are longtime clients of our practice   are house calls the norm at your practice   no  gregory and alison were close friends     lovers    no   he was gay   no  they were just    friends   what in god's name happened to them   looks like red john   who's red john   we don't know who did this   we'll be in touch probably  thank you   set up right here   yeah  that's good   red john enters here   excuse me  sorry   he comes around here   he waits for her  expecting her to come in alone   only thing  her friend tannen chose the wrong night to come over for a richard gere and ice cream orgy   so red john zaps 'em both with his trusty stun gun  and     excuse me   grabs a 5 iron from the bag here and    bam   crushes tannen's skull   then he takes his sweet time dealing with alison how he likes   she's a nice big girl  so unless he's pretty strong   i'm guessing that he grabbed her by the arms and     today is the         he says he's sorry for all the pain he's caused you and your mother    deeply sorry   he asks you to forgive him   can you do that  jenny   he needs to hear it   i forgive you  daddy     oh  yes    daddy  i forgive you   he's smiling now   they're tears of joy   he says   god bless you and keep you    he's gone   amazing  amazing  amazing   she's    amazed   patrick       one second    give him some time   ab absolu   come on back to us     i'm back  thank you    back   so  patrick  i understand that you're also sort of a paranormal detective   is that right   i try to help the police when i can   and  and you're helping them hunt this scary serial killer     what  what's his name red john    red  red john   thar she blows   classic red john smiley face   drawn in the victims' blood  clockwise with three fingers of his right hand   wearing a rubber kitchen glove   i'm stoked to finally see one in the flesh   this isn't red john   right   red john thinks of himself as a showman  an artist   he has a strong sense of theater   in all the previous killings   he made sure that the first thing that anyone sees is the face on the wall   you see the face first  and you know    you know what's happened  and you feel dread   then and only then do you see the body of the victim    always in that order   here it's the opposite   the first thing you see is the body  and you have to look around to see the face on the wall   doesn't play nearly as well  does it   depends on your taste  i suppose   no  come on  the killer could have painted on the correct wall here   but he didn't because he didn't know better because he isn't red john   it's interesting   you know what your problem is  my friend   you enjoy your work a little too much   you're a ghoul   if you don't get horny reading  fangoria   i'm britney spears   i i resent that   this is you trying to redeem yourself  is it   i'm sorry   he irks me   he's irksome   you don't need me here   so  yeah  this one doesn't fit the pattern   so jane was right  we have a copycat   or we have red john trying new things  or we have red john making a mistake   we don't know   we'll work the evidence until we do know   go talk to the husband   will do  boss   what are you waitin' for   so you might be right about this case  might be  thanks for the insight   no  did i say that   i'm acknowledging the fact that you might be right  that's all   i mean  if you wanted to come back  i couldn't stop you   yeah  fine  i'm asking you to come back   because   because you're useful to the team   no  no  i won't say  please   go screw yourself   jackass     good

with the rest of your time in fresno   i get this you  you guys can't catch the real killer   so you wanna lay this one on me   no  sir  if we have that confirmation of where you were   it lets us exclude you from the investigation   i was with a massage therapist   name   it had  lady  in there somewhere   it'll be on his credit card bill   there you go   pleasure meeting you boys   we're a full service private practice   we deliver primary care  uh  cosmetic surgery   psychotherapy  sports medicine   you name it   what's the african connection   it's what this place is all about   half our profits go to build and staff basic health clinics in poor african communities   ah  here we are   it's a thin file   alison was a healthy young woman   psychiatric history   she didn't have one   s t d s  abortions  unexplained injuries   personality and demange  no   except for some routine checkups with me  it's all dr  tannen   all aesthetic work   did tannen keep a diary   our last case was solved because the victim kept a diary   diary  i don't think so   getting back to alison randolph     how was her marriage  do you think   happy  unhappy   about six months ago  dr  tannen asked my advice   alison had asked him to get her a year's supply of birth control pills off the books   which is strictly against a m a code   i said sure  do it   i mean  better us than some tijuana drugstore   why the secrecy   price randolph had a vasectomy  april of '02   if there's anything else i can do     i appreciate that   actually  there is   i'm out of sleeping pills   can you fix me up   anything strong will do   sure  uh  come in for a consultation   we'll squeeze you in this afternoon   oh  no  i i was hoping to get something now   trying to avoid the chitchat   i'm sorry   i wouldn't feel comfortable prescribing without some sort of  chitchat    i understand  uh  no problem   i'll call you    maybe   i like the husband for it   he hires some hooker he knows to create an alibi  flies home   fillets the spouse  flies back again   the classic elaborate and clever but ultimately stupid plan   have you looked at his pga tournament record   it's not bad  6 mil career earnings   mm hmm  for coming in second and third   you put him on the 18th tee with a big one on the line   like night follows day  he'll shank it   he's a choker   he doesn't have the nerve to kill his wife  didn't do it   are you suggesting we drop a prime suspect because he's never won a major   oh  no  no  no  i'm just making idle conversation   how'd you do that   telekinesis   he blew on it   that is another way to do it   mr  jane  i have a question regarding your previous career path   fire away   when you met with other psychics   real psychics    could they tell you were just pretending   there's no such thing as real psychics   i beg to differ   my cousin yolanda is a psychic   your cousin is deluded or dishonest  or both   steady   no  no  he's entitled to his opinion   he's wrong  though     she has power    thank you   she can communicate with the other side   i've seen her do it myself   she let you speak with someone that's gone   yes   someone that you love and still miss very much   yes   you wanted her power to be real  so it was   no   you're so sure you're right   science don't know everything   would've seemed like magic   exactly   normal to communicate with the other side   the  other side    your father's a football coach  yeah   how'd you know that   it's obvious from your whole demeanor   my point is  didn't dad always say life is like football   when that final whistle blows  the game is over  done   there is no more  there is no  other side    this is it   lobster and bread rolls and nautical kitsch   and then    nothingness   you poor  sad man   the kingdom of god is a real place   okay  later tonight  when rigsby asks you to come back to his hotel room     say yes   excuse me   i know  you were planning on refusing him very curtly   first week on the job  you wanna set a tone   no monkey business  but why not   rigsby is an excellent lover  i'm sure   tough but fair  right   right   the kingdom of god is a real place  mr  jane  and you have an immortal soul   oh  i do so hope you're wrong   good night     good night    later  dude   this is    me   welcome to the unit  agent van pelt   thank you  agent rigsby   she explodes into action  reaching up to 60 miles per hour   she easily outruns her terrifying prey   gs  old friend   it's been a while    i hope you are keeping well   i am thriving and happy   i have 12 wives now and will soon begin courting number 13     why can't you catch me    you must feel so powerless and stupid and sad     oh  well all the best  red john    that sounds like the real deal to me   sounds like red john  it's not   red john wouldn't risk capture just to taunt me   so the real killer's trying to throw us offtrack   cho  find out where price randolph was a half an hour ago   rigsby  i want you to check the hotel security cameras   get those over to forensics   you okay   absolutely   get some sleep     hello    good morning   you didn't sleep  did you   i i'd like to make an appointment with dr  wagner  please  it's urgent   jane  patrick jane  yeah  i'll hold   forensics maybe got a break   the blood on the cloth in the envelope is alison randolph's   but they found a hair in there   doesn't belong to her or tannen   guess who it does belong to   it's yours  tag  amazing  huh   science   this is insane   i didn't    i didn't kill alison   how do you explain your hair in the envelope   either it was a mistake  or  or i'm being framed   who would want to frame you   we don't want to  if that's what you're thinking   he and alison were lovers   who would want to frame you  tag   my brother   why would he want to do that   alison and i were lovers   i think you are psychic  you're just afraid to admit it   so     so     why is it you can't sleep   because i can't get the good pills without talking to a doctor   and you don't like talking to doctors   meh  you know  they always wanna be the smartest person in the room  don't they   when in fact that's me  obviously   you protect your core self very fiercely   what do you think is the reason for that   you know  this is exactly how i imagined it would be   you gonna ask me about my mother   do you want me to ask you about your mother   i just wanna sleep   so what is it that keeps you awake   what's his name  red john   that's right  red john   uh  he's  he's killed at least eight women that we know of   uh  the police asked me to try and get a psychic fix on him   to see if i could get a sense of who this man is   uh  how do you do that exactly  get a psychic fix on someone   well  davis  true demonic evil burns like fire   it  it burns with a terrible cold  dark flame   i force myself to look into that flame  and i see an image of the evildoer    in this case  red john   he's an ugly  tormented little man   a lonely soul   sad  very sad    dear mr  jane  i do not like to be slandered in the media   especially by a dirty money grubbing fraud     if you are a real psychic instead of a dishonest little worm     you wouldn't need to open the door to see what i've done to your lovely wife and child    mr  jane  mr  jane   what is it that keeps you awake   you know  when i was a boy  we had a farm   it's a lot of work     i was kind of a lazy kid    yes   i'd always be trying to get my little brother jimmy to do my chores for me   one day  i promised him a dollar if he'd cut the firewood   well     he opened up an artery in his leg on the saw  and he bled to death     died     doing my chores for me   you know     that's almost exactly the same thing that happened to johnny cash   is it really   that's spooky     mr  randolph  good     cut the crap   my brother's done nothing   and you scumbags haven't got the stones to come after me  so you come after my family     that is flat out persecution    price  what did we agree   mr  randolph  rest assured  there's no intent to persecute you   we scumbags are holding your brother  because we have physical evidence linking him to the crime and potential motive in that  he states that whenever you weren't around  he was banging your wife like a big bass drum   tag and alison   that's what he states  and he further states that it was you that killed alison     and you're now trying to frame him in revenge    what'd you say   wh  bastard  you      son of a bitch    you treated her like trash   what did you expect   i didn't expect my little brother to be banging my wife   you little punk bastard   everything you've told me is total fiction  isn't it   yes   why   i can tell you're in real pain   why not tell the truth   the truth is mine     i hear ya    thank you   yes   remember  uh  we were talking about tannen the other day   and i asked you if he kept a diary  and you said he did     well  there's no diary among his effects    no   i'm sorry  no   no  you have it wrong  i i didn't think he kept a diary   strange   then it must have been someone else who told me   either that or i'm going mad   but i definitely  100  remember hearing that tannen kept a diary   well  that is strange  but why does it matter if he kept a diary   you're right  it doesn't matter   only i was thinking  why do magicians have beautiful girl assistants   why   because they're reliable distracters of attention   people will look at a beautiful girl for a long time  before they look where they should be looking if they wanna see how the trick really works   anyhow  i'll send over a couple of forensics guys tomorrow to search his office and locate that diary   mm  didn't they already search his office   oh  they never do it thoroughly the first time   once more for luck  eh  it's gotta be there somewhere   thanks for everything  doc     good night    good night   lost something   how did you get in   door was open   i think i left my phone in your office   the door wasn't open   must have been  here i am   what are you doing   i confess  the temptation to play detective was a little too strong  i     i was looking for that diary   i got a little carried away   no kidding   no diary   no diary   maybe i should have a gander   i'm good at finding things   be my guest   eureka   dr  wagner  thanks for your help   mr  jane   uh  your phone   right   thanks   uh  yeah  got it   silly of me     well  good bye again    wait   give me the diary   it's very amusing   i try   i knew   i knew it might be a trick  but i     i had to be sure   yes  that's how the trick works   what led you to me   not that i'm saying i did it  i'm just asking   when we first met  you said you didn't know who red john was   but you have books on criminal psychiatry  there    that have chapters on him   you're the randolph family doctor  so you could easily get a strand of tag's hair   and  being a doctor  you could hack up another human without difficulty   it's obvious it was you   that's it   you have nothing   that's just guesswork   oh  i know   i just wanted to be sure i had the right answer   i was surprised  i gotta be honest   you don't seem to be a wicked man   but you are   you're angry about the letter   yeah  it was a bit mean spirited   for the record  i'm sorry about your family   i can only imagine your pain   i'm not    a wicked man   my conscience is clear   really   right now in africa  there's 3 000 beautiful children alive today  who should be dead  but they aren't because of me   tannen was gonna ruin me and destroy all that work     over nothing  money   theft  he called it   embezzlement   self righteous idiot   it's simple math   if i go to jail  thousands of kids will die   so i made a rational  moral decision to kill tannen     for the greater good   and alison  what did she do wrong   as you said  she was the magician's assistant  just a distraction   if only tannen died  the police would've been all over this place  wouldn't they   truly  is killing two any worse than killing one  when so many lives are at stake   i don't think so   you poor  sad man  you're under arrest     let's go    i'm pointing a gun at you   you really think i would set you up so nicely and let you pull a loaded gun on me   i took the bullets out earlier     you're late    what   draw your weapon   drop the gun   hands on your head   get down on your knees  down   closed case doughnuts are here   i just went to get sleeping pills  i swear to god   i i didn't even wanna go     you know i didn't want to go    right   yeah  you didn't set wagner up     didn't figure it was him days ago   you didn't let us tear apart the victim's family simply to satisfy your childish need for drama   meh  that family was screwed anyway   don't blame yourselves  guys   don't even start   i'm still angry     i'm sorry    no  you're not   a frog  well
