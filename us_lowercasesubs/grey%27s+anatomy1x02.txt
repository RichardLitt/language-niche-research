previously on  grey's anatomy      the 7 years you spend here as a surgical resident will be the best and worst of your life   you will be pushed to the breaking point   eight of you will switch to an easier specialty   five of you will crack under the pressure   two of you will be asked to leave   dr  shepherd  we should pretend it never happened   what never happened    you sleeping with me last night   or you throwing me out this morning   you're an attending  and i'm your intern   stop looking at me like that   like what   like you've seen me naked   your first shift starts now and lasts 48 hours   you're interns  grunts  nobodies  bottom of the surgical food chain   what are you doing here   you and i are gonna have so much fun together   you know meredith is inbred   like it's uncommon

gonna survive this  right    it's all about lines   the finish line at the end of residency   waiting in line for a chance at the operating table   and then there's the most important line     the line separating you from the people you work with   it doesn't help to get too familiar   to make friends   you need boundaries between you and the rest of the world   other people are far too messy   it's all about lines   drawing lines in the sand  and praying like hell no one crosses them   look  i'm sure you're very nice   but i'm very particular about who lives in my house  and you're just not right   why  look  i'm quiet  no loud music  no parties   where were you when the challenger exploded   the what   the space shuttle challenger   uh    i think i was in kindergarten   exactly  no

why are we not attempting to re attach the severed penis   teeth don't slice  they tear   you can only re attach with a clean cut   if she wanted to slice him off with a knife     besides  the digestive juices didn't leave much of the flesh to work with   right  so  what do we do   sew him up minus a large part of the family jewels   and his outlook   he'll be urinating out of a bag for a very  very long time   not to mention he'll never be able to have sex again     oh  too bad    shame   let's all take a moment to grieve   clamp   richard   we got the rapist   he stumbled right into
