intellectual of life    dan foxworthy is like the super exclusive  shrink to the stars    he was on our list of l a 's best  self improvement gurus    how did you get that appointment   i just called and asked  don't tell bette i told you  okay   but  what are you guys doing  i mean   you don't need a shrink   we're just checking in   we're about to do this incredibly major thing   but wait  you guys have the best relationship of  anybody i know  gay or straight    i just want to make sure we're good    sorry    could i offer you a ride    i missed you so much   i     missed you   is that all you have   that's all i have    can't believe you're here  come on   she's always running late   she had a board meeting   then she had a meeting with an artist   bette's the director of the california arts center   i see   and    she's probably going to be really  stressed about time   after this  we have to go get sperm   we're trying to have a baby  and our  friend sean's donating   sorry i'm late  james  yeah  i gotta go in a minute   nononono  the art work is way too delicate   it's being flown in from paris    and annie is already a total and  complete nervous wreck    just call adam's fine art movers    tell them if they want to do business with c a c   again    exactly  okay  great  thanks  bye    o kay  here i am    so   we are heading north right now   towards the hollywood hills   a little further to the right  is the hollywood sign   and uh  if you keep going all the  way in that direction   you hit the pacific ocean   oh  can we go   yeah  whenever you want  as often as you want    do you want to tell me what the thinking is  behind trying to have a child together  when your sexual relationship has been  pretty shitty for going on three years    it's not shitty  it may not be perfect  but     there's a lot more to a  relationship than sex    we've been together for seven years   i know plenty of couples who still  have sex after seven years   well  it's not like we never have sex   a lot of heterosexual couples          have children when their  relationships aren't perfect    you know  you just obviously don't understand  what happens in a lesbian relationship    i knew this was a bad idea   it's just  i   i don't believe that a straight   male therapist can possibly understand    early sex is passionate  it's illicit   exciting  still has that      factor  but    very quickly   a kind of symbiosis develops    it especially happens between two women who are doing  the work of making a serious commitment to one another   and when that merging occurs  the intense mutual  dependency can be a deterrent to sexual intimacy   oh my god  the lesbian urge to merge    we have to stop now   oh   do you want to schedule another session   uh  we'll let you know   i think tina and i need to talk   what about this insemination   uh  that's not up for discussion   not up for discussion   no  it's not  i quit my job    i was a pretty successful  development executive   now i want to relax and prepare  my body for pregnancy   that's what i'm doing   i'm ready to start a family   we're both ready to start a family  right   absolutely  right   okay  great    so this is it    i can't believe this is our home  tim   it's very traditional    wait'll you get to know it   what do you mean    it's just uh    not as traditional  as you might think    so  here's your new home    i can't believe i'm finally here   this has been the longest six months in history  tim    yeah but your studio's finally ready   okay  so this used to be a garage    til a few days ago  i did a remodel  on it for you  go on  try it out  go on    oh my god   i love it    i have to go  allright   i'll be back soon    what a fuckin' auspicious occasion   i'd love to break open a bottle of champagne  but i've gotta get back to work sometime today    sorry it's not more enticing   hey  don't worry  i do this all the time    i love his new work  he's using paint  so much more freely   yeah  i don't remember his work having  this much texture   i don't want you to be stressed out  annie   i   i know this is your first time curating for me   and i'm going to give you a lot of support   hey  listen  this'll lighten your load   guess what tina has between her legs    close  a jar of sean heaney's sperm   i kid you not   she's keeping it warm  well  supposedly  once it's been ejaculated    it survives longer if you keep it at body temperature   huh  oh  hold on a second    uh  it's only about half an inch but  they say it's quality  not quantity    god  it's repugnant  i can't believe  i used to swallow that stuff   yeah  tina said i could swim here whenever   they're uptight at the chateau   how are they uptight    they don't let you swim naked   it is a public pool   allright  i'm going to take a look  at this and while i'm gone      well  you remember how i told you  that there's a fair amount of evidence now  it's more likely to take if you're aroused   she's not serious  am i supposed to fuck you   right here    i think it would help    this is just    this is  this is too weird for me   i mean  i   i   i just   y'know  i really  frankly  i find it incredibly inappropriate that she even suggested that   you know  i bet she would never do that with a straight couple    come in    could you come here a minute  please    you might want to take a look at this    shouldn't they be moving more   yeah  that's what i wanted to show you   i am so sorry to tell you  but that stuff wouldn't get anyone pregnant

of  bringing a child into the world and having   absolutely no say as to how he or she is raised    i must have children all over the world   now  why would i have a problem with this one   i will sign the donor's contract now    uh  jean paul  i don't mean to be rude or  anything  but do you have any  uh  medical     problems  any history of family illnesses  or      health is excellent with the chamois family    uh  jean paul  i know you say that you're  comfortable with all this but i just  want to think about it for a minute    where is this contract    mm hmm  and  uh  when we do this

your baby  too    no   no  it's just me and her  bon    jean paul not only are we monogamous   we don't sleep with men    but  uh  to have a baby there is no other way    just    just not an option for us  okay   but  for me it is the only option   an obligation   i cannot bring a baby into this world that is  not conceived through the passionate           between a man and a woman    hey  the penis  the pussy  the baby   you can't be serious   mm hmm  ze penis  ze pussy  ze baby    oh  god  i swear  c'mon  tee  it's funny    i'm sorry  i don't find it funny   wow     try  it's important to

it's because she's so stupid and stupid people are too dumb to be insecure   dana    she's your friend  it's confidence  okay  i'm telling you  it's because of her nipples   what do you mean it's

of a little scary right now  i'm feeling a bit  um  overwhelmed   don't take it out on me  i'm not the enemy  i know   i know  you couldn't be more supportive of me   you wanna get that   hello  hi  uh    yeah  how are you       oh  okay  yes  no problem  okay  okay     bye   um  that was  uh  that was marina  we're gonna have dinner on saturday night   we don't have plans  do we  because if we do  i can reschedule  um      no  go ahead  it's fine   we were just gonna get together and we were gonna talk about the book club   but tim  i think i should call her back and tell her that you and i need to spend some time together   jen   i have a basketball game with the department heads saturday night   go  have dinner with marina  it's fine   okay   thank you   she said she was coming  it was kinda last minute  though   so you think she might not be showing up  i don't know   maybe we should spend a little time talking about you   i'm sorry i'm late  but i have a really good excuse  so don't make this easy on me   i have found the perfect donor  who   marcus allenwood  he's an artist  and he's just been selected for  the next whitney biennial  i had a serious conversation with him   but    but i've never met him   no  but i know exactly what you and i are looking for and he is so perfect   he even has a kid so we know he can get someone pregnant   i never  met  him  you will meet him tomorrow   he's coming by the house at 11 and you're taking him to the cryobank   he's leaving the next day for cologne  he's a in a group show   tee  he's willing to do this for us so we can have the sperm on ice for when you're next ovulating   it'll be there when we wanna use it   m   marcus  tina  right   um  i have to get something out of the bedroom  and uh  have a seat  and     and then we'll go to the    cryobank  okay   fuck  okay     ready  tina  did bette not tell you i was black   no  not at all  but  i mean  she didn't    not tell me  'cause it doesn't matter either way  right   i can't answer that for you  no    uh  okay  you ready to go   let's do it   hi  i'm tina kennard  and i'm here with my friend  he's here to make a    deposit   marcus  right  that's right   and it says here you've recently been hiv tested  i have all my paperwork   then here's all you need from me   the bathroom is down the hall  on the left  and there are magazines in there if you need any encouragement   i'll be right back   wow  that's a pretty serious decision to make  isn't it   you must've given it a lot of thought  'cause really big men like that tend to make really big babies   you'll probably be looking at a c section   hi  what's up  hey  she's uh  she's in the back   bye  bye  see ya  see ya later   what's going on  what are you doing here   i got this    vague but urgent message from alice  oh  great   you put me in a fucking awkward position  how could you not tell me that marcus allenwood is black   god  i   i    i don't know  i guess i   i should've  i    i just didn't think  it would be a problem for you to use a black donor   but    i didn't say i didn't want a black donor  i just think we should've discussed it   we absolutely discussed it  tina  right in the very beginning  we said  that if you were going to be the birth mother  that we should consider finding an african american donor   that way the child would be more like our child  but i wasn't prepared   i don't understand  other than    being committed    to spending the rest of your life with me     what more do you need to do to prepare   look at me  bette  i don't feel qualified to be the mother of a child who's half african american   i don't know what it means to be black   i think i can make a contribution in that department   and don't you think  on top of everything else  to also have two moms     that is a lot of otherness to put on one child   your reaction to marcus allenwood  however honest it might have been  comes across to bette like a rejection of her identity   i   i love bette  i    i love who she is  i    i just wasn't ready for how i would react   do you know what that says to me  that we're not ready to have children together    because sarah schuster came down  and now she reviles you  like you revile your own craving    what do you think   you scare me sometimes  i see you going right to that edge  and i think i've lost you   and then you come back with    and i know why you have to disappear on me like that   i'm so fucking proud to have you in my life   i'm so proud to have you in my life  do you know that   there's something i wanted to get this afternoon before my game  i'm gonna go do that   mm  i don't know  what time does milk start  why don't you just ask dana to go   you know  you guys are just going to have to work that out  well  i'm sure shane's gonna be there  yeah  why not   of course she is  oh really  hold on  where are you going   i don't know  doesn't the program start at 7 30   yup  you don't have to come  you can go out with alice and shane   shit  you know what  i can't go  yeah  bette's giving an art talk at the c a c  yeah  no  allright  have fun  bye   when she looks at you  she's not looking at a black woman or a white woman  she's looking at the woman she loves   she sees what she wants to see   maybe she sees what you let her see  i mean  maybe this wasn't important before   maybe what's worked best for you all these years  you know  getting all your pretty things and  you know   putting together your pretty life  is that you let people see what they want to see   what are you trying to say  nothin'  just    maybe it's been easier for you that way   that's nice  that's really nice   oh  come on  don't walk out  oh  come on girl  don't walk outta here   don't walk outta here like this  oh  come on   i really just don't need this right now  we gotta stop doing this to each other   we   okay  i gotta stop doing it   i'm the one that always ran away  okay  but don't do what i did  stay  hear me out  because i'm not going to say what you think i'm going to say   there's only one thing that cuts across all our realities  it's love  the bridge between all our differences   and you have so much love in your life  why are you trying to tear down that bridge  why   i don't know   so you called shane  right  i thought you did  i thought you did   i told you to call  i swear you said you were calling   no  i said you call  whatever  she'll be here  she'll be here   how do we draw the line that signifies whether an image reads as pornography   i mean  who gets to say what passes as art and what is obscenity   the debate has been taken up by laurie papou in a series of paintings entitled  a group of seven    please welcome laurie   so laurie  to what extent is this body of work meant to be read as a narrative   she's awesome  your girlfriend  she is  isn't she  sometimes i forget   you two   really beautiful couple  i mean that  you're really beautiful   why is it so depressing  because it's the same faces  night after night   week after week  floating clubs  floating girls  oh  she's cute   she's been with two of my exes  staying out of that vicious cycle   it's amazing  this is where i
