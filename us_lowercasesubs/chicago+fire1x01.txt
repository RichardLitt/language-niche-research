elevators   which makes you otis  sorry   hey   guy in the water   how about a guy with his head up his ass   you handle your firefighters  i'll handle mine   that's a good theory  casey     how about giving it a try    know what   i'm getting real tired of your bull  severide   i don't give a damn what you're tired of   hey   i thought you all should know i am gonna fight  that dick olmstead who slept with my wife  in saturday's drop a cop   or we could all just throw the gloves on right now   beat the hell out of each other   maybe when the mayor comes on saturday  that's what he sees   truck versus squad     old as the cfd  so deal with it   we all lost darden a month ago friday   and that ain't changing   so maybe we should     hey  heather    hey     hey  guys    hi   thanks for
