you got your eye on anyone   em  not really   actually  i was talking to the mouse   but now you mention it  some of those women are pretty hot   and we did just save them from the wraith  and we gotta trade on that while we can  before they discover that we're not that cool   sit down  i'm ready   i'm surprised you're still eager to volunteer for this rodney   well you know me  always eager to help   right  so do you have any questions about the process  i mean you are a scientist   uh  yeah  i'm sorry  medicine is about as much of a science as  i don't know  voodoo   all i need to know is that  that will enable me to use ancient technology  like major sheppard or yourself   yes  hopefully  you are the first human trial   well why now   i mean  if it's possible  we need as many people with the gene  as we could get   well actually  without proper fda approval  virtually impossible on earth to     let's just say  it's legal here  in the pegasus galaxy   and completely safe   as far as experimental gene therapy goes  i am manipulating your dna  here we go   maybe you should tell me more   we believe ata  or ancient technology activation  is caused by a single gene that's always on   instructing various cells of the body to produce a series of proteins and enzymes   that interact with the skin  the nervous system  and the brain   in this case we're using a mouse retro virus to deliver the missing gene to your cells   a mouse retro virus  it's been de activated   well are there any side effects   dry mouth  headache  the irresistable urge to run on a small wheel   oh that's very amusing  so how long till it starts working   it could take some time  what is that   it's something i found in one of the research labs  something the ancients were experimenting with   do you know what it is   pretty sure   desalinizing the sea water and storing it in tanks big enough to supply the whole city   good  so fresh water  won't be a problem   it seems some ancient technology requires the user to have the gene   other things merely require initialisation  once activated  like the control room   anyone can push the buttons to make them work   good morning doctor weir   morning  careful  i think we need to designate some recreational areas   yes   we certainly need to clear the hallway and have everything put away as soon as possible   and can we lose the ten thousand year old dead plants   of course  we're still in the process of making sure everyone's been assigned living quarters   major sheppard seems to be taking his time locating enough space   well the safety and security of this expedition     ok  i'm ready   oh my god   did you see that   yes  what that     i'm fine   look  becketts gene therapy worked   i was able to activate this  it's a personal shield  that acts like a protective skin   they must have inertia dampening properties too because i didn't feel a thing  watch this   hit me   ow  god   you didn't have to swing so hard  and i notice that he didn't even hesitate   i'm still trying to understand  how you thought it was a good idea to test this device  by having someone throw you off a balcony   oh believe me  that's not the first time we tried it   i shot him       in the leg   i'm invulnerable   aren't you the one who's always spouting off about how proper and careful scientific procedure must be adhered to   invulnerable   alright  take it off  let's go have this meeting   she's jealous   oh yes  green with envy   this could be a problem  i can't get at it    just checking   episode 3   hide and seek team24 et sg 66 pour transcript   stargatedanielfriendly net  i'm thinking mr invincible   captain untouchable   ooh  that's good   you guys done   i've been working on this gene therapy for months  forgive me for wanting to celebrate the fact that it worked  on the first human trial   oh  let's all have a toast   just a thought here  but have you tried eating or drinking anything since you put that on   that's great   this may be more serious than i suspected   oh thankyou  i'm hungry already  what am i going to do   if i don't get this stupid thing off  i'll be dead by the end of the day   relax  you can live three or four days without water   i'm talking about food   you found some ancient text with the device  what did it say about taking it off   oh yeah  there were some explicit instructions  which i chose to completely ignore   well  some ancient technology uses a mental component for operation   just shut up  i'm thinking   is there any chance that the gene therapy isn't permanent   it's possible   oh  i'm a dead man   we can probably maintain security in this area  with the limited number of personnel we have   my people can help   thankyou teyla  for the time being we'll find other way's that the ethosians can contribute   you do not trust us   it's not that  it's just that we  we need to train your people in our weapons and tactics   you invited me to be a member of your team   and we value your knowledge and expertise   as we value all the ethosians   for now  there should be more than enough living space for everyone  within the designated area   we have always lived in the shadow of the wraith  but my people have never been in a place such as this   they are afraid  some believe that the ghosts of the ancestors remain   i don't think that's the case  but still we're gonna need a bit more time in order to explore the entire city   we're very cautious  intergalactic  explorers   and we don't want anyone else getting hurt  the way hollan did   i mean everyone needs to understand they're not to touch anything unfamiliar  unless it's been cleared first   it's very important  you never know  even a tiny little innocuous thing  can kill you   dead man talking   carson   doctor weir   so groden's got a team  going through the ancients research material that accompanied the shield device   but mckay's been through it  and he didn't find anything helpful  and he is the smartest guy here   so he likes to tell us  listen  i feel terrible  it's possible this is the result of artificially imposing the gene   well i have another theory  we know that there is a mental component  to using ancient technology   you don't have to remind me  i experienced it first hand  with that drone weapon  back on earth   exactly  so don't you think it stands to reason that mckay should be able to shut this thing off with his mind   are you suggesting he doesn't want to shut it off   we may be settling in here  but this place  it's still pretty intimidating   a giant abandoned city  full of things way beyond our level of understanding  impending threat of attack from the wraith   no question  it gets bloody creepy here at night   so i'm not saying it's conscious  but perhaps subconsciously   i don't think he wants to die of dehydration   no  neither do i  but he's not there yet   you think when it comes down to it  the shield will just shut itself down   the ancients were smart enough to put failsafe's into their other technology   this entire city rose from the deep of the ocean  when danger was imminent   why would they design a personal shield that could kill you   i certainly hope you're right  for rodney's sake   the self destruct system requires two separate codes   now each code is unique  and everyone here will be required to memorise their code   well don't bother giving me one  sorry   as far as we know  this is the only stargate in the pegasus galaxy  which is capable of dialling earth   which would make it the last line of defence against the wraith   if they're gonna attack  which we must consider a very real threat  we simply cannot let them gain control of this complex   if both codes are properly entered  the naquadah generator will overload  it will take 30 seconds   you're sure it'll do enough damage   ever see a 20 kiloton nuclear explosion   i have    not up close  look  i think we should tell teyla what's going on here   at this moment  we still don't know if it was one of the ethosians  who tipped off your arrival to their planet   i trust teyla   so do i  but teyla trusts her people  if we tell her  she'll wanna tell them  and i need more time to get to know them   well  they thought he was finally dead  but when they turned their backs to go      his cold dead eyes opened beneath his hockey mask  and he rose up with his giant bloody knife   what's a hockey mask   hockey's a game  guys skate around the ice and try to put a puck into the net   the goalie's wear masks  it's really          scary  tell us more of this game   can we play it   actually  i don't really see the attraction  now football  football's a real mans sport  but we'll save that for another time   yes  it's time for bed  and remember  tomorrow night kids  another tale called  nightmare on elm street   alright children  let's go   thankyou major  i hope i didn't scare them too much   i don't think so   good   ah listen  teyla   don't tell mckay what i said about the hockey not being a real man's sport   because    it's a canadian thing  they're a little touchy about it   i'm interested more in hearing about his football  you say you love so much   i can do one better  come here   father  do you think we are safe here  from the wraith   i think there's nothing certain in life  except my love for you   do you miss the wind   yes  but if you're very quiet  you can hear the ocean   do you think the ghosts of the ancestors still live here   jinto  go to sleep   funny   oh here it comes  watch this   oh  that is beautiful  can you believe that   should i not   well the defence didn't cover the receiver  cos he didn't think the quarterback could throw that far   they seem very happy   well we just won one of the best games of all time  against all odds   flooty won that year   and then went to play in canada   he played hockey too   hey  what are you guys doing   teaching teyla how football is the cornerstone of western civilization   and you didn't invite me   you like football   no  not really   of course  it's real  it's unpredictable  it's full of passion and beer   cheerleaders   i just don't get that you got one personal item  and you chose this   it's a metaphor  don't you see  this entire expedition  is the biggest hail mary in human history   what is a hail mary   it's a play that you just saw  it's named after a prayer   see this woman and her name was mary  and she uh     did i mention how much i like ferris wheels   aren't you going to be the wraith   you can be the wraith  i get to be major sheppard   one  two  three four five  six     wex   jinto   major  major  jinto's missing  i can't find him   i told him to be careful  that anything he touches can be dangerous   what if there are monsters here   we'll find him  jinto's missing  teams of two  floor to floor sweep now  starting with the jumpers  full gear   yes sir   he's not in any of the other living quarters   i'm coming with you   are you gonna be ok with that leg   he's my son   can we use the sensors to locate him   we don't have nearly enough power to activate the whole city at one time   even if we could  the sensors don't distinguish     individuals  for all we know  there could be shielded areas  or malfunctioning sensors   we are getting a pretty strange energy reading in one of the unexplored areas  across the city   activate the communication system   done   jinto  this is doctor weir  if you can hear me  please respond   jinto  if you're lost  if you can't     we've lost power   we've still got lights   i don't know why that happened   that wasn't me   shut it down now     what the hell is going on    i don't know     nothing like this has happened before    we've only been here for a couple of days   this stuff is pretty old  it's that  or there really are ghosts   control room  this is sheppard  the lights just went out   major  we're experiencing some technical malfunctions  i think it's something to do with the interfaces between our naquada generators and the city   that  or the way we isolated certain systems  could be causing erroneous operations in the ancient programming   i'll run a diagnostic on the power flow   i wouldn't have thought you believed in ghosts   i never used to  then i learned about things called wraiths  that can suck the life out of you with their hands  what the hell is that   dr weir   teyla  i'll be right there  do what you can   right   dr weir  this is marta   pleased to meet you   it's alright  tell her what you saw   a shadow   the wraith project them  make you see things that aren't there   are you sure   and yet i sense no wraith here   teyla  have you ever been wrong about that  major sheppard  this is weir   one of the ethosians is claiming to have seen  what she's calling a shadow   she does not believe me   teyla say's that she senses no wraith here  but i'm still concerned   alright  i'll just fall back to the gateroom  and wait for further instructions   we can't stop searching   if there is a threat here  we need to establish a proper perimeter   i've secured access to the control tower and the living quarters   two more ethosians reported seeing the shadows   you know  i don't get that  that means the wraith would be here   you don't think so   i don't think they wanna scare us  when they decide to come  they're gonna start blowing the crap out of this place with their ships   so what  the ethosians are just seeing things   well  like teyla said  it's a scary place for them   not just for them   hollan wishes to speak with jinto   please   go ahead   jinto  if you can hear me  i'm not angry  i just want to know that you are safe   so if you are lost  or hurt  stay where you are  make some noise if you can  we will find you   is that latin   it's ancient  fathers of the light  of the everlasting temple   it is a prayer to the ancestors   if you are angry that we have unrightfully inhabited your great city  we humbly apologise   we mean no harm  we will leave  if it is your wish  but i will not go without my son     he fainted    there's gotta be a better word   faint  is the proper medical term   i passed out from manly hunger   well  hang in there  dr weir  mckay is ok  he fainted   oh yes  very sympathetic  let's all mock the dying man  thankyou   it didn't look like the phantoms the wraith's make you see   but i can see how the ethosians would be confused     what did it look like    it looked like a      darkness    it surrounded the naquadah generator and started to grow   like it was feeding off the energy   when you shut it down  the whole  whatever it was  it just went away   if this thing feeds on energy  we could be in big trouble   and when i say we  i mean you  because i won't actually be around for much longer   so we need to figure out exactly what it is and what to do about it     we know it's attracted to energy    how about shutting down the generators   well people also give off heat energy   granted it's negligible compared to that of a naquadah generator    but you take away this things only other obvious sort of food and      are you saying it could come after us   well i only know one thing for sure  and that is flying darkness  that eats energy  can only be very  very bad   ok  we keep the power on  groden  figure out a way to detect it    and major  in the meantime  establish a constant surveillance on all the generators   if one of them is targeted  we'll shut it down remotely   and hopefully we can keep this thing busy   until we figure out a way to get rid of it   attention everyone  this is weir   for the time being  we need you all to remain in your quarters  unless otherwise instructed  if you see anything out of the      hello  can you hear me  can anyone hear me   jinto   major sheppard   are you ok   i'm scared   where are you   i don't know   jinto start from the beginning  tell us how you got to where you are   i was in the hall  outside my quarters   where did you go next   i can't remember   he's used to the forest  being able to see the stars at night   i found a small room  filled with boxes from earth   no boxes   they are here with me   this room would make a nice closet   this is definitely not a closet  did the panel start to glow  when you stepped inside   yes   did you touch it   yes  what exactly   i don't remember  just before he disappeared  we got an unusual energy reading from this area here   oh  no  no     must be a transporter    we can name it later   major sheppard   jinto  are you ok     yes   i've got jinto  and he's ok   do you have any idea  what this place is   some sort of research lab  we've come across a few of them   these consoles generally access the central computer system   so jinto could have cause what we thought were malfunctions  from here   look  i need to know  everything you touched   as far as i can tell  there's only one entity   the bright blue spots are the active naquadah generators   this blob is our entity  it was just a matter of calibrating the sensors   your idea's working  so far i've been able to anticipate  it's approach to the active generators  and shut them off remotely   here  watch     got it going in circles    good job   thanks   i hope we're not making this thing mad   lt  this is doctor groden  i'm tracking the entity going your way   you might want to get out of the hallway  you're standing in   roger that   this is ford  a bulkhead just blocked our way   there's no panel on the wall  or any way to open it that we can see     roger that    mckay   we didn't touch anything  it could be the entity  causing random malfuntions   proximity to that large an entity disturbance  could cause the ancient technology to go haywire   lt double back and try the door on the east side of the hall     this door won't open  either    here it comes   open the console on the wall   hurry     what next    i'm not sure  what do you see     three crystals    take out the middle one  pull the top one down   if this door opens  go   i'll be right behind you   it's not working   ok  use the middle one to bridge the two others     you sure about this    not exactly   go   man down  i need a medical team   right  hang in there     are we in any danger here    i wish i could tell you     how's ford    it's like he was hit by lightening     he's gonna be ok    he's a tough kid   sir   hi   will you tell this guy  there's nothing he could have done   there is nothing you could have done   i could have tried to pull him out sir   then we'd both look like this   ah  you don't look so bad   dr beckett says you're gonna be back to pretty boy  in no time     apparently it's also an elevator    really   you can stop taking the stairs everywhere     oh  how nice for you all    what have you got   well believe it or not  jinto didn't touch anything of any consequence  other than that    it must have it's own power source  like the jumpers   what is it   well it's some sort of containment vessel  for the energy creature   and jinto released it   well  it seems that way  as i suggested   the energies must be causing most of the technical problems   it was captured for observation   the ancients were researching ascension     really    what exactly is ascension   well at some point during their evolution  the ancients reached a     an advanced stage of being  where they were able to rid themselves of their physical bodies   and rise to a higher plane of existence  one in which they live as pure energy   i know it sounds ridiculous  but this is the first indication  that there may have been evolutionary intervention to get there   a little gene therapy of their own huh   well i haven't read all the notes  but what i do know  is that the entity is energy   it feeds on energy  fords lucky  i mean  the more it feeds  the bigger it gets   the bigger it gets  the more charged it becomes  the more deadly it will be   is it intelligent   well according to the research  it is sentient   but if you tried to talk to it  you'd have more luck with a great white shark   this thing is going to suck the power out of our generators  and then it will kill us all   alright  what will we do about it   the entity's been trapped in here  since before the ancient's abandoned the city     i know i'd be pissed    and hungry   the point is  this device was designed to track it   capture it  and hold it for observation   there's still a chance we may be able to get it back inside   i'm just gonna need a little more time to figure how     hello   jinto has something he wishes to say   i'm sorry  what happened to you was my fault   where i come from  we've got a little saying   stuff happens   it's a little different  but you didn't mean for this to happen  did you   no  you're a good kid   you weren't doing anything wrong  which means this isn't your fault  ok   same as when we came to your planet   we didn't mean for the wraith to show up  they just did   that's why you're here  your home was destroyed   you almost lost your dad  i don't remember you getting mad with me over that   stuff happens   it's not falling for the same tricks anymore     how smart is this thing    rodney   i don't know  but this is much simpler than i thought   it's kind of like a mousetrap   this button here  causes the device to emit an energy signature that attracts the creature   this one  shuts it in   now the only downside  is it looks like  someone's actually gonna have to be here to press the buttons     i'll do it    ok  wait a minute rodney  you're still wearing the shield    is there a chance that if something went wrong  that would protect you   i had a feeling   what do you mean  had a feeling about what   you think i wanted to come off just now   you think i'm scared  i'm not scared  i'll do this   no that's ok  you might faint again   look  it's just not working anymore  look    it doesn't work on you either   i just meant that i wasn't going to let you die   it's just a coincidence that it happened to stop working now  i need a drink   go   you always told me  i shouldn't be afraid of the dark   well  i was wrong   i can't sleep now   what if the darkness comes   it won't   how do you know   because   it's afraid of fire   the darkness is afraid   everything is afraid of something   so the shield device  just came off by itself   yeah  it just stopped working   he even tried it on sheppard   it wouldn't work on sheppard   why not   mckay didn't tell you  the text we studied  said the shield imprints on the wearer   if we were right  it wouldn't work on anyone else  we're ready   you do realise that when we shut everything down  we're going to lose the sensors   we're not going to be able to track it   we have security personnel  posted around the living quarters   at least we have some warning   teyla told the ethosian children  that lighting a candle will help protect them     and you're doing it because       it's gonna get dark in here   ok major  go ahead   now   shutting down power   it's coming   i think we're gonna need a bigger boat     size doesn't matter    that's a myth   it'll fit  the device traps the creature inside   you just need to make sure  it's all the way inside the containment vessel  alright  come on   son of a bitch   what happened   the damn thing took one look and went away   it's a lot smarter than we thought   we need to know where it is  right now   we'll have to turn the power on  to use the sensors     you can't do that    do it  just the operations tower   what now     it's headed this way    because you turned the power back on   we can't go on like this   do you think it wants to be here   what do you mean   it's been trapped here for thousands of years  alone   it's not alone anymore   it doesn't think on that level  it thinks about eating  that's it     you would know    if we stay  it will kill us     not unless we kill it first    well  i don't see how   then either we must go  or it must   maybe it wants to go   if we open the stargate   this is a bad idea     you've said that already    well  it's worth saying again   it's coming   an open stargate  is a huge power source  this thing is smart   it knew enough  not to get trapped in the containment vessel again   what makes you think it's going to follow a naquadah generator through a wormhole   what  you got a better idea   good luck   are you ok   it's almost here     do you have an address    m4x 337  barren wasteland  dial it   that was good thinking   it's not going anywhere   we can't see if the malp got through   the entity could have drained the battery   it could be feeding off the stargate  off the generator  this is a disaster   shut it down     i can't    the consoles are dead   there must be something we can do   we don't know if the malp is still down there   it's possible that the entity will still go through the gate   once it's depleted the energy in the naquadah generator  on the malp   or it could just continue to feed off the gates energy   mckay   rodney   mckay   the power must have been drained by the entity    medical team to the gateroom   he's not burned  he's breathing   mckay   mckay    what append    you did it   i did   it went through the gate   you must have passed out   well thanks for not saying the other thing   that  was a hail mary   thankyou  take your time  man down
