 just to be clear  when you say your sister  do you mean your sister or your friend       dude    oh  jesus     i mean my sister    oh  okay  cool   i was just    because he could mean his friend or his     stop talking   so we're packed into this little place on walnut   we're halfway through the night  everything's goin' all right   all of a sudden  i notice this dude eyeballin' me from across

the major reasons we got this bar was to get laid   maybe you did it to get laid  i got a little something i like to call business ethics   business ethics  the only reason you don't care is you have
