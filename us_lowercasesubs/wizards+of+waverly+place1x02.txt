here   bye  dad  bye  mom   hey  excuse me  your son made me this sandwich   oh  l'm sorry  look  he's only 12   no  no  no  lt's terrific   l'm jeff malone  concessions manager and backup announcer for shea stadium   we're considering local delis to provide the official sandwich  of the new york mets  mets  mets  mets   l think you should submit this sandwich for consideration   theresa  honey  this guy is from the new york mets   and he wants to consider us for their official sandwich   which sandwich   the one your son made  to the max     that's not really     a bad idea   that's not a bad idea at all   to the max is one of our most popular creations     just get max to make one for us later    okay   great  my sandwich associates from the new york mets  mets  mets  mets   and l will be by on saturday for judging   great  lets go mets  mets  mets   yeah  yeah  yeah   unbelievable   l know  your parents are so cool   come on  buddy  just picture the sandwich in your mind   yeah  maxy  l've seen you make it before   what do you start off with   yeah  l don't know  l just throw stuff together   okay  let me think   l started with licorice   licorice on a sandwich   no  l ate some licorice  and then l started my sandwich     lt had ham    okay   lt had bologna  yogurt     yogurt    yogurt   on a sandwich  that's disgusting   that's the point   l just can't remember   what are we gonna do  jerry  the new york mets  mets  mets  want the sandwich that max made   well  maybe we can throw a bunch of stuff together like he does   max can taste it  tell us what's missing  until we find the right combination     what do you say  max    okay  whatever it takes to help dad   that's the spirit  son  let's go  come on  grab a bun     weren't you scared    a little   rook to queen bishop 4 is always a risk  but that's just how l roll     ls your hand sweaty too    yeah   l have enormous glands   l don't mind   l don't get it  justin's so full of life and she's so full of halloween   l don't know  harper  maybe on halloween  she'll dress up as you   she could never pull this off   l make a lot of my own clothes   oh  which reminds me  l need some more egg cartons   ls your hand still sweaty   yeah  but l like it   so l'll see you tomorrow     yeah    yeah   tomorrow   what     shaking hands   were you saying goodbye or closing a deal   why didn't you kiss her   lt's none of your business   look  justin  you know a lot of stuff about stuff people really don't care about   which is great  but l know about relationships   l know how girls think   so do l  they're right brain dominant and they have a slightly larger hypothalamus   there you go again  knowing stuff people don't care about   okay  okay  l'm saying that l'd be open to suggestions   good  because miranda really wants you to kiss her   l can tell because she brightens from tragic to just gloomy  when she's around you     so    so if you don't do it soon   she's gonna think you're really not into her   then someone's gonna have to play chess by themselves   l already do that   you ever think of this  miss smarty pants   maybe l don't wanna kiss her   okay  l'll be spreading that rumor around   look   okay  l know this is gonna be hard to believe   but l've never kissed a girl   l find it hard to believe that you think that l find that hard to believe   hey  l'm on it   l thought if l picked a girl that l didn't like  that it'd be less scary   that's why l picked miranda   now guess what  l like her and l'm scared again   all right  this is what we're gonna do  first of all  take out  5     why    l need  5  second   tomorrow  when you walk her to school  take her by that scary  abandoned house   right  because she'll think l'm brave   no  you'll get scared and she'll comfort you     that's when you plant one on her    okay  that's a great idea   thanks  do you have five ones for this 5   great  because my 5 was lonely   does anybody see anything   yeah  that little squiggly thing in the back of your throat   we are looking for someone at shea stadium making our sandwich   so we can see what's in our sandwich   now  concentrate   lf l go back in time and look into a crystal ball   will l see me looking into this crystal ball   okay  that is not concentrating   now    now that was cool   lt's irreplaceable   l   what am l gonna do   l know   okay  here  justin  here   do this spell on the crystal ball   when l had my powers  it was a lifesaver   say  ''mcreary timereary ''    why    just say it   oh  and do this   mcreary timereary  did we just go back in time  l have got to learn that     mcreary time     oh  no  no  no   that spell is just for emergencies   lt rewinds time for a few seconds  to give wizards a chance to correct a dire mistake   no questions     you mean like a do over spell    yes   but it's too dangerous  don't even think about it  all right   lt bends time and space  and you're not ready for it   no more questions   do people remember there's been a do over spell   only people in the magical world   regular people have d  j   vu  stop asking questions   so that's where d  j   vu comes from     l said  no more questions    lt wasn't a question   hey  l have one  what's d  j   vu   well  it's when you feel like something's happened before   for example  dad  do you have  5     why    because l need  5   d  j   vu  huh  justin   so how did the big first kiss go   lt didn't happen   why not   because when l went to pick her up  she didn't wanna go to a scary house   she wanted to go through some dark alley instead   but a dark alley's even better than a scary house   but you said scary house  l was totally focused on the scary house   the point is she wanted you to kiss her   why didn't you take my advice  lots of people do   l'm the one that told vice principal clements to fix his dead tooth   now he's getting married     okay  l panicked    panicked   well  now you gotta kiss her quick  or else  all she'll think you guys will ever be is just friends   that's never gonna happen  she's into me and l'm into her   that could change in a hurry  plenty of other guys think she's pretty   no way  everyone around here knows we're kind of going out     you know  people respect that    oh  really     well  let's see about that  hey  matt    hey   miranda's pretty cute  right   yeah  you know  l got a note from her in seventh grade  said she liked me   bet you she still does too want me   that's too bad  l hear she's going out with justin     who's justin    l'm justin   so   okay  thanks  matt   no  thank you for the heads up on miranda   yo  miranda  wait up there a sec   what did you just do   l just proved that not only do l know girls  but l also know guys   no  you got matt to ask out my girlfriend   wait  l can fix this   here's a cute girl  kiss her   this is my spanish teacher   l think l just told her my name is library   well  mr  library  you should check out a book on kissing   thanks a lot   look  justin  l'm really sorry  but you have to admit   miss gonzalez is a young looking teacher   l don't care about mrs  gonzalez   l care about how my girlfriend's going to the movies  with a guy that my sister set her up with   will you relax  lt'll all work out because l know relationships   you keep saying you know things and you don't   hey  l was right about miranda wanting to kiss you   and l was right about matt thinking she was pretty   okay  fine  you were right  feel better  because l don't   look  justin  the only thing getting in the way here is you   you know what  l know   l've had a ton of chances to kiss miranda   l'm just mad at you because l'm mad at me   you are  yeah  you are   and if miranda's ready to kiss me  you know what   l should be ready to kiss her  and it's not too late     yeah  it's not too late    and this time  l'm gonna be ready   what are you doing   starting my training montage   lt's close but this one has too much teriyaki   honey  we didn't put any teriyaki on it   then it needs teriyaki   this one has too much cheese  this one needs barbecue sauce   and this one tastes like armpit  how do you even know that   wrestling   honey  calm down  max is doing the best he can   right  l know  okay   buddy  l know you're trying as hard as you can   lt's just  if we can become the official sandwich of the new york mets   our life will be gravy   that's what's missing  gravy   gravy  then what are we doing standing around talking about it   oh  come on  gravy  come on  gravy   come on     that's it  to the max    yeah   to the max   tastes even better the second time   so heard you're going out with a guy named justin     right  justin    l thought we were  but l don't know   that's cool  yeah  totally   do

you soon  you were gonna think  that he wasn't all that into you  and that's what you were thinking  right   alex  what are you doing here   look  l felt bad  so l came down here to make sure that you kiss her     you were gonna kiss me    well  it's not a surprise now  is it   sorry  l'll be back here if you need me   all right  just for that  l'm leaving my cell phone on   oh  look at those lovebirds  lt's so great when things work out   harper  what are you doing here   l'm not harper  l'm just a theater seat   keeping an eye on my boyfriend   you made an outfit to match the theater

 l'll go left  you go right    then we'll both be going the same way   oh  yeah  let's both go left   justin  l'm a little nervous   this is our first kiss   don't worry  l'll guide you through it   miranda  l'm so sorry   l'll get some napkins   where are you going  why didn't you kiss her yet   l spilled soda all over her  she's never gonna kiss me now     wait  do it over    what do you mean   the spell that dad used on the crystal ball   no way  dad said that's for emergency use only   because you don't know l'm your girlfriend   doesn't mean you can sneak around behind my back   how does that do over spell sound now     like it should have already happened    now we're talking   mcreary timereary  justin  l'm a little nervous   this is our first kiss   l know   l mean  let me move this   this is gonna be a long night   mcreary timereary  and that's why it's called     to the max    right     nothing like it in the city    kind of a buffet on a bun   what did l tell you   ls this the sandwich for the new york mets  mets  mets  mets  or what   you're right  this is delicious   congratulations  mr  and mrs  russo   to the max is now the official sandwich of the new york

popcorn   and that's why it's called     to the max    right     nothing really new here    you're right   a better name would be d  j   vu   because somehow l feel like l've tasted this before   lt's the do over spell     l swear l'm not doing it    l know   but l'm pretty sure l know who is   mcreary timereary  mcreary timereary  gross   justin  that's 1 7 do overs already  what's wrong   l'm
