being a diabetic  you don't mind needles   i'm michael  by the way   scofield  i read your report   and you are   dr  tancredi will do   tancredi like the governor   you're not related  are you

trust me  means absolutely zero inside those walls   the only way you're getting that insulin is if i'm administering it   guess we'll be seeing a lot of each other  then  huh   i guess so   we're all clear on the burrows execution   good   except for one thing   bishop mcmorrow is not in the fold   he's got a lot of influence with the governor   they went to prep school together  apparently   look  the closer it gets   the more i'm worried that the bottom  is going to fall out of this whole thing   well  maybe it's time you arranged a visit with the good bishop then   look  in one month   it will all be over   the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men  and be crucified  and the third day  rise again   and they remembered his words  and so should you   good day  gentlemen  may god be with you   michael   why   i'm getting you out of here   burrows  roll it up  happy hour's over   it's impossible   not if you design the place it isn't   too formal   too greeting card   we gotta make a decision sooner or later  you know   we have time   we don't  actually   i mean  at some point  we gotta pull the trigger on this thing   i don't want to rush this   we're only going to do it once  we have to get it right   honey  can i ask you something   of course   are you putting this off   what do you mean   i mean  are you having second thoughts   no  honey  no   i'm not   i don't know   i just can't help thinking this is about     it's not   i love you     and i want to be your wife   passion  what were you thinking   hey  you went for it   she probably thinks i went sissy up in here    passion   got more than one syllable  too much talkin'   that's me from now on   one syllable sucre   yes  no  love  hate  love     give it time    are you kidding   i proposed to her   that doesn't take time  si or no  one syllable  man   she's supposed to come around for a conjugal on tuesday   she's always calling me beforehand  letting me know she's coming   this time  man  i ain't heard a peep   you spooked her   scofield    get it together  pope wants to see you   no good  fish   no one gets an audience with the pope   not unless he's real interested in what you got going on   top of your class at loyola   magna cum laude  in fact   i can't help wondering what someone with your credentials  is doing in a place like this   took a wrong turn a few months back  i guess   you make it sound like a traffic infraction   like all you did was turn the wrong way up a one way street   everyone turns up one sooner or later   the reason i called you here     i noticed in your i file  under occupation   you put down 'unemployed '  that's not true  now  is it   i know you're a structural engineer  scofield   shah jahan built the taj majal as a  monument to his undying love for his wife   my wife is quite fond of the story   it appeals to the romantic in her   being married to someone in corrections     terrible job   wouldn't wish it on anyone   and yet  in 39 years my wife has never complained   and the worst part about it is  i've never thanked her   so  because i couldn't say it   i thought  you know  i could build it   come june  it's our 40th anniversary   but here  look     you see  the problem is     i build anymore   it's all gonna come down like a house of cards   that's where i was hoping you could be of assistance   for the favor  i can offer you three days of work a week in here   and it'll keep you off the yard   i can't do it   son  it's better for me to owe you one in here than it is for you to owe me one   i can promise you that   i'll take my chances   then we're through here   guard   two pounds of pot   what were you trying to do  set a record   it's not funny  lj  you could be going to jail   it's pretty obvious to me you need some guidance   hey   thanks   from who  old daddy warbucks   give him a chance  he's a good man   we got nothing in common   where is this coming from  lj   last semester you were getting almost all a's and now     it's your father  isn't it   i don't have a father   it wasn't an immaculate conception  honey  trust me   maybe it's time we went and saw him   mom     ma     don't   i'm about as excited by the prospect as you are   but something's gotta give   you have got too much potential to be screwing up your life like this   what if they'd sent you to taylorville or marion and not here   i think i'd be doing the same thing i'm doing here   eating jell o  drinking kool aid     i know what you're doing   it's not luck of the draw that you're in here with lincoln   you forget i know you  both of you   you two have the most dysfunctional idea of love i've ever seen   what  he beats you up to keep you off the streets   so you get yourself tossed into fox river with him   to what   save him   i deserve to know  i loved him as much as you did   past tense for you  maybe  not me   i gave him a shot when i got back from college  i did   even with all the stuff that was going on with him   i did everything i could to make it work  and he threw it away   you ever think maybe he was hurt that you left in the first place   don't do this   whatever it is you're doing  don't do it   there's a better way  i'm already appealing your case   i told you to leave alone     i've gotten in touch with the diocese about lincoln  the bishop     that won't stop it  it'll only delay it   you want to do something   you find out who's trying to bury him   nobody's trying to bury him   the evidence was there   the evidence was cooked   visiting hours are now over   take care of yourself   someone wants him dead  veronica   something more is going on here   this is desperation  michael  you're grabbing at straws  you're in denial   maybe  but i can't watch him die  i won't do that   gentlemen     what is it about the burrows situation that i can help you with   it's our understanding that you have great influence with the governor   i wouldn't say it's great or influence   we're friends   it's also our understanding that you oppose the death penalty   i'm a man of god  how could i not   in this case  we're hoping you'll suspend that position   at least temporarily   if the inmate appeals to me for intervention   how can i turn my back on him   you have a habit of answering a question with a question   and you have a way of asking questions that beg more questions   are you saying you won't do it   i'm not a man to equivocate   you're what      that's right   i would assume  then   that you'd be well versed in how our government's tax system works   taking personal capital gains under the church's tax shelter     well  that would be fraud  wouldn't it  your excellency   i will not be cowed into forsaking my beliefs   not by you or anyone else   admirable   good day  excellency   mr  kellerman     what is it about this case that the secret service is so interested in   the man killed the vice president's brother     what'd he say    you heard me   someone found fibanacci   i'm looking at the photos right now   son of a bitch has a beard  sunglasses     witness protection  if i ever saw   who was this someone   there's no return address on the envelope   just    this folded up bird made of paper   like origami   yeah  like that   like origami   you're charles westmoreland  right   do i know you   i knew your wife before she passed     you knew marla    you mean anne   how'd you know her   we talked together in boston     east farmington    you mean west wilmington   no more tests   i promise   seems you know everything about me     who are you    michael scofield   how'd you get it in here   first off  she's not an it   she's marilyn and she's grandfathered  back from the days when prisoners were allowed a creature comfort or two   i heard you were d b  cooper   every new fish comes in here   first thing they hear   is that charles westmoreland is d b  cooper   i'll tell you like i tell them     you want the cooper story   i can't give it to you  'cause i'm not him   it's too bad   sort of wish it was true  the man's a legend   nowhere near as much as i wish it was true  friend   i'd have a million five waiting for me on the outside   i'd put some grass under 'em if i were you   this thing would go a whole lot easier if you'd just hire me   what is this all about   say you were able to get outside those walls   would you have the people in place to make sure you disappeared forever     why do you care    just curious   where's fibanacci   that's not the way it works   they come at me  john     i'm coming after you   i doubt it   fight  fight  fight     i totally misjudged you  scofield   i didn't think you were agitating type   behavior like that will not be tolerated in my prison    that ought to be enough time to convince you of that fact    that's right   something you want to say   it's just     i'm not of much value to you in the shu   value   hm mm    the taj   it'd be a shame for the 8th wonder of the modern world to collapse  because the stress is improperly propagated   improperly propagated   improperly propagated   the joints are overloaded   they won't provide anywhere near  the sheer strength the completed structure will need   how much work are we talking   you want it by when  in june   yes   then we'd better get started  wouldn't you say   who's there   bishop mcmorrow was killed last night   someone shot him while he was sleeping   i thought you'd want to know   thanks   michael was right   sink  you got a visitor   he was arrested   for what

that chance long ago   i'm asking you to love yourself   you can still put the brakes on this thing   so  that's what fatherly advice is like   where are you going   i got homework   they're putting me to death  lj   in a month's time  i'll be dead  you get that   you're already dead to me   yes   what  you mean yes yes   yes  yes   yeah   oh  there's just one thing   of course   my mom say we
