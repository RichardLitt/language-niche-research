that rhyme with 'life '''  dude  isn't that the hannah hand   the cd signing  lf he stares into my eyes  he might recognize me   _ that's never gonna happen  _ but what if it does   you could learn to love him  like with my brother's hamster   and here's the beauty part  lf oliver dies   you won't have to bury him in the backyard   when you talk  do you hear it  or is it like a big roaring in your ears   step off  chad   fine  but you're gonna throw this away for me   take it off  dude  take it off   dude  what's with you and the gum_chewing   little baby ollie  aunt harriet just wants to eat you up   'cause you're yummy  yummy  yummy   let me kiss that off you   l hate that woman   been sittin' here all morning  l'm trying to write a song   can't remember when it ever took me this dang long   maybe l should just up and fly the coop 'cause everything l've written sounds like     l got it  dad  l got it   prepare to be blown away   this better be good  son  l was in the middle of a masterpiece   jackson stewart  come on down  you are the proud owner of a brand_new     used car   yes  over the last 1 5 years   this preowned beauty's been driven by heavy smokers and sloppy eaters  and one wilma mcdermott  whose cat popped out six kittens on the front seat   yes  some stains just don't come out   _ and you're happy about that  _ yes  l am   dad  it's mine  lt's not perfect   but it's my own car  and l bought it with my own money   l'm proud of you  especially the bought_it_with_your_own_money part   _ let's take a look at this puppy  _ puppies   _ that reminds me  and in the back seat    _ l don't wanna know   yep  there she is   clean  no dents and     there's that stain   _ where is it  _ lt's right here   this   l know  l can't believe it's mine  either   and l can't believe you just bought a girl car   what   jackson  only girls drive this thing   lt's a chick mobile  a babe bucket  a skirt scooter   you might as well have bought a bra with tires  man   you are so wrong  this is totally a guy's car   when l was driving home  there was guys honking  and waving and    giving me kissy faces   oh  no  dad  tell me l didn't just buy a chick car   you didn't buy a chick car   now say it like you mean it   l'd like to  son  but you know how ladies like to have the final word   thank you so much  l love you all  thank you   thank you   let's boogie  driver   that was great  oliver stared right into my eyes and never had a clue   kinda like the look he has in spanish   l don't know what l was so worried about anyways   better pull over  driver   don't be scared  lt's me _ oliver oken   wow  you're even more beautiful upside down   thank you  you're so sweet   he was talking to me   look  you are very sweet  but l have a boyfriend   a boyfriend  wait  l don't understand  then why did you kiss me   l didn't  the dog did   ah  man   those are the lips l've been thinking about for the past 24 hours   l'm sorry  l was trying not to hurt your feelings   lt's just that    l'm just not interested  ok   ok  l get it   now get down off the roof  son  before you dent it  this is a rental   fine  l won't bother you anymore   lf it helps  the dog hasn't stopped talking about you   _ you must think l'm pathetic  _ no  l think you're sweet   _ and maybe if l didn't have a boyfriend    _ l'd have a chance   _ l never said that  _ but you implied it   and that's good enough  l'll wait for you forever   _ l never said that  _ forever  do you hear me  hannah   forever   that was close  he almost got you tonight   ya think   you know what that boy needs  a real girlfriend   dad  that is    the smartest thing you've ever said   you know what they say _ every now and then  even a blind pig snorts up a truffle   and that is the weirdest   that's right _ it's me   _ yo  locker man  _ l'm up   _ l owe you  _ l'll be back to collect   locker man   you're amazing  oliver   l've been told that   _ having trouble with your locker  chad  _ yeah  could you   well  locker man is on the job  but     not for you  sucker   oliver  see that girl pamela over there   _ she thinks you're cute  _ can't say that l disagree   too bad l'm cruising down the hannah highway   what about kyla goodwin   she is so desperate she'll go out with anybody   my type of woman  too bad l'm taken   what about lilly  you guys would be perfect together   _ excuse me  _ you're both stubborn   _ l am not  _ see  you always agree   _ no  we don't  _ l am definitely seeing a couple here   you're not    because l'm not     that's smart  because what if one friend loved another but didn't get loved back   then things would get weird  and they couldn't be friends anymore   and there is nothing more important than our friendship   oh  man  you love me   no   l mean  l do love you  but like a brother or a pet fish   l'd cry if l had to flush you down the toilet  but l don't wanna kiss you   that's a relief  because you're my buddy   l think hannah and you could wind up being close friends   _ closer than you think  _ great   once hannah and l are together  we'll have you over for some sushi   yeah   soon  my love  we'll be together   you enjoy that   this isn't over  pal   goodbye   hello again   l know that look  either you have a great idea or you really gotta go   oliver is about to totally get turned off to hannah montana   and l really gotta go   l can't believe he wouldn't take the car back   l thought l made a very convincing argument   well  technically  son  getting on your hands and knees  and begging for a do_over is not really an argument   _ hey there  neighbor  _ oh  man  it's mr  dontzig   and he's wearing his robe again   yeah  well  count your blessings  at least this time it's the long one   so    stewart family   what would another leaf from your tree be doing in my hot tub   l don't know  maybe it wanted to party   _ come on  just trying to be neighborly  _ that's nice   but l hate neighbors  that's why l got the big hedge   so  something needs to be done about this   yeah  and l think something needs to be done about this   l would recommend possibly some sit_ups or maybe a bigger robe   very neighborly   got a new car   you know  my wife  she had a car just like this   traded it in  she thought it was too girly   get your leaves out of my hot tub   l'll have you know that we stewart men don't define ourselves  by the types of cars we drive   that's it  this dolly wagon's going back where it came from   _ but the salesperson already said no  _ to you  not to me   face it  son _ l'm a bit more intimidating   lord  take me now   _ l came as fast as l could  ls she still here  _ there   l can't believe you saw hannah break up with her boyfriend on our beach  the moment l was getting home from the orthodontist   _ l know  knock  knock  who's there  fate  _ fate who   just go   _ this is it  _ good luck  oliver  but remember   lf things don't work out  you're still smokin' oken   _ thanks  but it's gonna work out  _ absolutely   but if it doesn't  smokin' oken   'nuff said   lt's me  oliver  l heard about your breakup  and l'm here for you   lf you need a hug  my arms are open   _ get away from me  _ l can do that   hannah   hi  the kid from the moonroof  look at you  all upside right   where are my manners  sit down  sweetie  join the party   here  you want some gum  load yourself up   l didn't know you liked gum   l've surfed all your websites  and none of them mentioned you're a chewer   l'm a chewer  all right  l love to chew   l chew all the time  like a train   l chew in the morning  the afternoon  the evening   _ lf it can be chewed  it's in my mouth  _ good to know   you should think about updating your websites   why  does it bother you  lt really turns off some people   they can't even be around me  they love me  but l disgust them   well  l'm not like that   you're not   _ because it's ok if you are  _ no   relationships are about sacrifice  and l accept you just the way you are   good to know   move over  boys  new chew comin' through   your mouth    lt's     turning black   lt's licorice  l love licorice   don't make me laugh _ it comes out my nose   _ you wanna see  _ no   too late  she's about to blow   am l grossing you out  because l totally understand  if you want to transfer your obsession to mandy moore   _ you know  she's blond again  _ no  no  no   my love is bigger than my disgust and your black drippage   black drippage  watch this   sacrifice  sacrifice  sacrifice   how do you like me now   l     _    still love you _ what does it take with you   what more do l have to do   you and hannah montana are never gonna be together   why not   because     l'm hannah montana  me  miley   ok  that went well   _ you were hannah in the limo  _ yeah   _ backstage when l hung out the window  _ yep   and when l hid in your bass drum and rode on your tour bus to phoenix   _ you did what  _ nothing   _ how come you didn't tell me  _ l'm sorry   lt's just that l knew that you were so in love with hannah  that l was afraid that maybe you might     be in love with you   do you think l am   you tell me  l mean  have you ever pictured yourself with miley  your friend the dork   _ you're not a dork  _ oh  come on   what about the time l tripped in the biology lab and spilled frog juice all over you   right  mom made me take off my pants in the school parking lot   or when we were at andrew's birthday party and you accidentally knocked me  into the pool in your one_man stampede for the cake   that's not fair   lt was an ice_cream log cake  and you know l have to get an end cut   come on  oliver   let's face it  the girl you thought you loved is standing right here  and the truth is     you don't love her   wow  l think you're right   that's two years of my life l'll never get back   sorry about that  so  what do you think  are we gonna be ok   yeah  we're ok   _ anything  _ no   ln fact  it's a little awkward   let's go grab a hot dog   so    mandy moore  you don't happen to have her number  do you   boy  you bounce back fast   where's my dad  lt's been hours   he couldn't sell it _ that's what it is  and now he can't face me   maybe something good happened   maybe he parked it and a bunch of cheerleaders stole it   you think so   here he comes   still driving it   l knew it  failure  you're a failure as a father   get a grip  they wouldn't take the car back  but l did do something to beef it up a little   dad  changing the horn is not gonna make it a guy car   l know  but this might   dang  this is tight   _ son  l primped your ride  _ oh  yes  he did   thank you  thank you  thank you  thank you   thank you  thank you  thank you   ok  son  you can let go now   lt was cute when you were five  now it just throws my back out
