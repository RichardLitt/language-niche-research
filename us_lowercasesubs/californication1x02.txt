around     you know something  bill  is it    yep  still bill   well  i appreciate the parenting advice  but maybe   just maybe  giving them too much space is not such a good idea   maybe too much space is actually the root of the problem   hank  please    my daughter is 16   and she's an angel  clearly i'm doing something right     you poor bastard    excuse me     homo says what    what   gotcha   what the fuck is that   you like it  i could've bought a car instead   i think you should still buy the car  and then run over whoever created that turd   everything okay here  boys     it's

hitting it off with somebody right in front of you   you're right  it could be very painful     but i think i'll get through it    okay  so i take this  to mean the answer is no  you're not going to marry me   hank  i'm standing right here   did you ever stop and think that it might be nice  for becca to see us all get along for a change   yes  and it might be nice  if i could fellate myself while farting the white album   but i haven't been able to quite master that yet     so      is he coming   absolutely   what can i bring  bob  bill   whatever the fuck   that's not a  fuck   becca   your assistant makes me want to touch myself in a bad place   that's nice  my assistant makes me want to hang myself   while masturbating   are you retarded or something   funky back tat on the small of the back  you know what that means   she likes it in the pooper   really   i have no idea  i just wanted to say  pooper   i ve found  that the back tat is a watermark of the promiscuous  though   still  she's the world's worst assistant   she drops calls  she loses manuscripts   she can't even get my fucking macchiato right   but she does seem to have a nipple ring   quite possibly two  there is something very cool going on in that area   enough about my assistant's nipples  you want to talk some business     how's the new book coming    now  that's a hostile question   you have owed your publisher a book since becca was breast feeding   i remember because i used to like to watch karen do that   kiss my black ass   you need a fucking job   what  okay  what do you got   listen     you hear that    what   that's the sound of my phone not ringing for you   you have burned every bridge  i built for you with my bare hands     except  of course hell a magazine    no  don't say it      they want you to blog for them  just take the fucking meeting already   let's ask dani california   hell a magazine  thoughts   you'd be perfect for them   nipple ring  two   anywhere else   she's got

 who pollute this once great city of yours   just so you know  it's not and never will be my city   use the blog  hank   channel your rage   you're a dying breed  you're a real writer  a real man   you've got heart  balls  and swagger   either way   come over to the dark side  hank   join us at hell a magazine   i appreciate the enthusiasm  i do     but i don't have much to say    think about it   where you going  i thought i was the real deal   it's a shame i'm in a relationship   write me something  hank     good night    good night   the airplane     so  what do you think   my tits   seriously   they seem pretty fucking groovy to me     think they're too small    too small for what   i want to make them bigger   they're absolutely almost perfect  in every conceivable titty way   what about my lips   highly kissable   not those lips   these   what about them   do you think they're too floppy     what    floppy   i think of getting them fixed   vaginal rejuvenation  you heard about it   get them trimmed up a little   that way they don't look like day old deli meat   i think i just lost my manhood  and got hungry at the same time   i can help you find that   you can try     hey  this is you    i thought you recognized me   i'm not a big porn guy  actually   and who might that be   my daughter   do you need to go    see to her   it's okay  she'll quiet down  don't worry about it   go be with your daughter   i'm gonna have to confiscate this thing for further study   piece of shit   hell a magazine blog number one   hank hates you all   a few things i've learned in my travels  through this crazy little thing called life   one  a morning of awkwardness is far better than a night of loneliness   two  i probably won't go down in history   but i will go down on your sister   and three  while i'm down there   it might be nice to see a hint of pubis   i'm not talking about a huge'70s playboy bush or anything   just something that reminds me  that i'm performing cunnilingus on an adult   but i guess the larger question is   why is the city of angels so hell bent  on destroying its female population   jesus h  christ   nope   just little old me   are you okay   you look a little pale   are you gonna have a heart attack   you are getting on in years   just because i'm older than you doesn't necessarily make me old   well  i am 16  you know     so i've been told    what's the word for that again   it's statutory rape   that's two words   hi  daddy   honey  put some clothes on  okay  we have company   i'm sure it's nothing he hasn't seen before     thanks for coming    thanks for having me   it's my pleasure   the pleasure is all mine   i think this is     an important first step we're taking here   really  what step is that   the one where i sit back and watch  as you try to steal my family out from under me   it's not gonna happen   game on  broheme   hey  you didn't have to do that   well  i didn't  it's for me   sorry about that   hank  sonja     sonja  hank    hi   uh  i love your writing   and i love you   i read your adaptation way back when soderbergh was gonna do it     i fucking loved it    hey  my salad days   you and i are gonna get along just fine   i'm sorry  honey     can i borrow the missus for a moment    yeah   can i talk to you   what the fuck are you doing   what do you mean   you're trying to set me up with this woman   i thought it'd be nice for you to have a play date with someone your own age   and if we get along swimmingly   hankie   i had to leave you  remember   i'm not holding a torch here   and you need to get on with your life   and you need to get in touch with your emotions  woman   he says he's not used to dating   nobody likes you   you're ugly and your mother dresses you funny   now smile  you fucking douche   dad     dad    yes     can i get a dog    absolutely   yes  as long as it poops here   we'll talk about it   i'm sorry  hank     my apologies    that's fine  bill   she's very sweet   well  i'd like to propose a toast   to friends     family     a new beginning     and a happy ending   well said  honey     i'll drink to that    cheers  cheers   so  how did you and bill meet   i don't think this is the right setting for that     i think this is the perfect setting for that story   bill hired karen to redo his place    this place   and along the way  they talked zen and the art of the mid life crisis  and    eventually  fell head over heels in love   in karen's case  heels over head   and bill got another trophy for his mantel  and     karen got to move into her own barbie dream house   talk about being the architect of your very own     happy ending     got it    that's a bit of an oversimplification     but i'm not surprised    floor is all yours  bill     i'll pass    that doesn't surprise me   how did you and karen meet     some other time  sweetie    mia  i don't think     what  i'm curious  come on   karen's not a big fan of memory lane     i'll tell it    rebecca   mom was going to art school and playing bass in this downtown noise band   dad had just published his first novel   they met cute at    what was it called again     cbgb's    right   he thought she was pretentious   and she thought he was way too pleased with himself   but they had sex anyway   in the morning  he made her breakfast   and she talked about her plan to move to seattle  so she could stalk and marry     chris cornell   right   but then she read dad's writing   and that was it   nine months later  i was born   they never got married  of course   but they stayed together a long time   a lot longer than most people do   oh  my boyfriend's here  i got to go  bye  daddy   good night     bye  honey  so long    i wish i could tell  an interesting story about me and my ex   but it's really just l a  clich  number 4b   he was sleeping with his assistant   oh  shit  that happens     his name was ted    your husband   his assistant     could be worse    really  how so   well  instead of finding out that your husband was gay   you could've found out that he was a     scientologist or something like that   i'm a scientologist  hank   or a nazi   or al qaeda     keep trying    see  this is what i love    about l a  is the diversity    my bet you do   the eagles   eagles of death metal   cool  right on   i liked having you here tonight   well  i liked being here tonight   bullshit   oh  it's a pleasure doing business with you   i hate to burst your bubble  sweetie  but     that movie has nothing to do with your old man   of course it does  your novel  while very much an exercise in nihilism   is firmly rooted in romanticism   you read the novel   jesus fuck   you shouldn't take the lord's name in vain     where'd you get that old chestnut    bill   i was wearing my cradle of filth t shirt   the one with  jesus was a c word  on the back   that's my girl   but i do pray sometimes   sort of   what do you pray for   that you and mom work out your shit and we move back to new york   no  honey  you don't owe me anything for that one   dad   are you okay   but i'm working on it   can i get a dog   oh  you're good   you're good   son ja   hey  look  i'm sorry about before     what i said  i don't know what the fuck i'm talking about half the time     ask anybody  they'll tell you    no worries  no worries   you want to    you want to get fucked up   why are you so smiley   there's nothing quite like getting stoned on the very bed  that your ex domestic partner shares with her fianc    it's the little things   could you do me a favor   absolutely   tell me what you think   honestly   yeah  honestly   i'm  forty something years old   i don't have time to play games  i need to know the truth   your breasts are obviously real   and  um  you have     an abundance of pubic hair   which is really nice   and  um     there's no evidence of vaginal rejuvenation   i'd say aside from the fact that you worship a space alien   you just might be the most beautiful woman i've seen in a long long time     thank you   it's my pleasure   would you do mean other favor   would you fuck me   my husband recently left me for a guy named ted   and right now all i wanna do is get fucked stupid  by a guy who actually likes women   if that's okay with you   i'd be lying if i said i never wondered  what it might be like to violate a scientologist   you must be looking like art garfunkel down there lately   oh  my god  you're obsessed   you haven't been in for a wax in months   so either you're taking your lady business elsewhere  or you're sporting a ginormous hippie bush   you know what  i hate that shit  i just came to keep you in business   and i just want you to be happy and hair free   well  i am happy   thank you very much   are you sure you're not making  a deal with the devil that your ass can't cash   what does that even mean   what   what   are you totally serious about marrying this guy   yes  why   i love him  he loves me   he's great with becca   i mean  what else is there   what about hank   what about him   he loves you  he's trying to get his shit together   he has been trying to get his shit together  since the day we first met   and the sex with bill  is it good   yeah  it's different  you know   come on   i want to show you my house   oh  my god   my house is my art   i don't think tom and katie would approve of what we're doing right now   oh  god  shut up and fuck me already   are you clear yet   shut up and fuck me   you are one kinky thetan   are you okay   right   oh  god     my painting    it's all good   we got it under control   it's all good   okay  we're so high   i don't know what happened   you look like ass   did we just have sex   what do you want from me   isn't it obvious   what happened the other night will never  ever happen again   and why is that   because it's sick and wrong   well  maybe i'm in the minority here   but i just don't think there's anything sick  and wrong about a little fucking and punching between consenting adults   you're not an adult  for one   you dirty old man   well  i guess i'll just have to     get out my vibrator and read your blog   that's cool  then it won't be a total waste of time   i thought it was cool   i was like   hey      i totally fucked that guy      must be weird  though    what   becoming the employee of a man you so clearly hate   what are you talking about   my father     he owns hell a magazine   mia  is that you   coming  daddy   always a pleasure
