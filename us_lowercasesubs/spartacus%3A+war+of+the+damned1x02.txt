but before we cut these hairs   dominus    the tank is empty   yes  we need rain   money also would fill   we need it too    how is your new puppy   breathe   with the money paid for it would fill

legadus claudius glaber    what are his intentions   similar to what i expected    he will come here   in two days   the reason for the visit unclear   it is  but the meaning is clearly  he has to thank me   why   since they paid more expensive the thracian   spartacus escaped the attempt glaber to assassinate him   the people asked for his release   that left in an embarrassing situation   when you buy it  i offering an alternative   at a high price   if spartacus survive the oath  the arena will be your grave it should have been   if not survive      his death will be a pleasure premature for the legadus   wishes of both be satisfied   i need a little help   a simple gesture of gratitude the legadus not enough   what we want is his support   no less than that   the legadus as our benefactor   the coins will fill it reservoir to overflowing    we will make a feast  yes  but small   with wine and water  of water   just enough     to wet the tongue   sacrifice a bull to have the favor of the gods   maybe something smaller      a sheep   may the gods bless us lucky   motherfucker      damn that pig still alive   that's him  the spartacus who everyone is talking about   spartacus    my name is      no one cares who did it   not give a damn for who he is    what is this place   life after death  friend   or at least the outside rusty gates   you are a guest honored now batiatus   owner of great ludus de capua   ludus   school training   where men are transformed into gods   blood is the nectar of them  and the arena is the top   gladiators   the most true brotherhood   survive the coming days      and you and the other recruits may live among us   and receive our brand   meanwhile  we offer something   food  water  maybe oil fragrant for your feet

kid  the best of my race   crixus  the undefeated   a frenchman  this explains why      smells like woman   take care of your wounds  eat  rest   when retrieving the forces     back to that conversation   weak  weak   a lot of shit  it should not stick   then you should join them  asshole   what's underneath your feet   answer   what's underneath your feet   sand   crixus  which is underneath your feet   holy ground  doctor   bathed in tears blood   your tears  your blood  pathetic lives  forged into something of value   listen  learn  and maybe live      as gladiators   now  pay attention on his master   you were blessed  each one of you      for being here in ludus quintus lentulus batiatus   that comes from the best all the gladiators   prove value in the difficult days ahead   stems are more than slaves  more than men   fail and die      well where they are or will be sent to the mines   triumph and stand up proud with my titans   batiatus  batiatus  batiatus   a gladiator     not fear death   he embraces  caresses      the fode   each time he enters arena      he puts his cock the mouth of the beast   and pray to return home before her mouth shut   none of you dogs last a moment   except one   this sad piece of thracian  survived against four men in the arena   sentenced to death  with nothing but a sword  to trust your life   came to him      again  again and again   he defied death  the fate and the gods themselves   must see this man  study it and understand      it is nothing   a coward  a deserter auxiliary troops   his victory in the arena was as empty as his courage   he fought against men poorly trained solonius   the rival of his master   if it had entered the arena any gladiator here   his head would not have been from your body   the thracian disagrees   a demonstration  perhaps   crixus   swords of training   prove us wrong  spartacus   take it   spartacus   this is not my name   your name  your life  is what we decide   perhaps the coward wants some advantage  to stop shaking knees   cledius   take it   i can not do anything with this one   send him to the mines   we seem in a hurry  right   an attack must be made the right foundation   he tends to push before winning balance    crixus   let advantage on his back and you will be condemned   test forces with an opponent more powerful and will be dead   throw your sword into the arena and you'll be dead again   his folly has cost a life   but its still can be redeemed   two fingers  a sign of redemption   a plea for mercy responsible for the games   beg for your life rabbit   finish him   crixus    dominus   keep your workout   he tried to kill his best man and you let him live   glaber visit us tomorrow   his intentions with the thracian include blood  and until they are satisfied  i intend to keep it warm and flowing   god  it's hot   good boiling language and the head   eat   slaves of shit and criminals  many of them   we are best   survived their implementation   twice  counting that the gaul  not present their brains to the sand   you're from a different source   above this band of unfortunates   and you   varro   the worst of all   a free man  sentenced by their own hands   why condemn a man voluntarily to that   some small debts      grew   pay them was difficult   if only affects me       you have family  wife and child   a boy   and my earnings to sustain   gains   if you fight well  is rewarded in cash   enough to pay my debts  if the gods want   gods      you're a fool   and in good company  it seems   it's the best i can now   but other   my mother would not send the arena   you have no mother   he left the cunt beyond  why is my favorite   no better offer   better  yes  that fits in my pocket  no   it is challenging and demanding instead of devoting themselves to the task   i insist only to honor him  batiatus  and this ludus   the legadus glaber come tomorrow  and with him hope best of luck  until then  these men are what i pay   turn them into rocks      or throw them in the mines   his will  my hands   ovidius  i apologize the delay   i accept the apology currencies   payments are late    3  really   exactly   kits vulcanalia are coming  could be extended debt by then   the debt most 30    thirty   or pay the debt now   the debt plus 30  after vulcanalia   next day    i could beat him   crixus   you would have shit all   would not have finished on the floor fucked like a dog   without training  the gaul defeat all of us  kerze   to say otherwise is nonsense   i pray not face crixus the final test   do not worry  not come so far  asshole   everyone can get the test   and beyond   freedom   one day  to fight well   freedom   worthless if you have money  varro   win the hearts of audiences the arena and will have both   he fought with the gladiators there   what are our chances   all will die   stand   sleep when they prove are men   continue to march   it's late   is even    back to your dreams   in a minute    we need better wine   we need several things   as we will again    is everything ready   i took care of everything   we can not fail tomorrow   achieve the support glaber      will   how sure   we did our best  is now in the hands of the gods   come to bed   and bring the wine horrible   i beg you   i do not fuck   stop   soon begins training day   eat   cock jupiter  now we train all day   still believes that all survive to prove   almost all   it is still a fool  then   batiatus paid these men   very little the appearance of them   the way roman lives for money   some are worth more others   i heard that some thracian cost expensive   i think the price rise even more   i remember how hard it was the march when he was recruiting   they must be mad with hunger   fill your belly   crap   wake me in time to die again   i apologize for the food   barca think delicious   do not eat in this joint  is less   the days will be difficult  no food    always worse   gave me your bread   my  no   i move things from here to there  even outside these walls   everything you need  ashur can   not owe anyone   i ask nothing in return   my only concern is its strength in the coming days   and how to escape from here   i tried once      other services i offer  probabilities   who lives and who dies  how quickly or slowly   what day or time   games to spend time and money    what about give me   12 to 1 in favor of mines   highest to die   crixus lose much if it is against the numbers   if i were you  would not go so well   do not think i am your friend   do not even think about it   how did you get   defying odds   i fear they are about to get worse     glaber   call me legadus   even an animal     the mark of his race   where is she  who   your woman    where   where do i want   she did him no harm   true  none   but you     you did me wrong   took auxiliaries desertion   questioned my orders   it ruined my reputation senate   and then  the arena  hurt me again  not knowing when to die   my life  so      in exchange for her   his life is no longer his to negotiate   if i wanted to get her i need only whisper   and the good batiatus give the order   then give the command in his ear   has a misconception me  thracian   true  ever wanted his death in exchange for their disrespect   but now i that was a mistake   would like to     it would be too fast   now my desires turned to blood      poured drop by drop  until it is exhausted   i told him that the shadow of rome was vast   and die under it  piece by piece   the roar of the crowd   a parting gift      to unite   i took her thigh   to preserve the scent   before my men to contaminate with their smell   no   it was fun  7   and when the fight finally let your eyes  sold it for a syrian unpleasant  currency by half   the thracian finally learned place in front of me   knees   the visit to the thracian satisfactory   man i do not care anymore   do not talk more about it   prepared a feast you   postpartum to rome   rome  now   something for the trip  then   there should have been given work  lucretia   these common dishes irritate my stomach   maybe a little wine  while we hope your husband    flavored   no  but taste the same   water  then   the heat and dust  it will rain again   we can only pray   i can not put your feet the streets of capua  without hearing someone begging to heaven by a drizzle   and yet the gods ignore us   maybe we did something that offended   i try to do a little something every day   so you're the cause  ilithyia   i would stay away   jupiter could launch a thunder at any time   he would have to choose between two targets   and i thought being in the presence a roman respectable   respectable is a word invented by men   that seek to enslave us her    i've been to a ludus   no   always wanted but my father never left   and you obey his orders   not all  nor those of my husband   how to live with the noise and the smell  surrounded by these      animals   yes  they are savage and brutal  are not they   seem out of a delirium   you do not care   and if they were all crazy  crying for blood   this family is ludus my husband for generations   and still standing   and their children  lets play with them   i have no children   sorry  i thought that a woman their age      come  let's go to rome    so soon   we can get a little   i want to watch the gladiators   another time  come on   kerz   make double with spartacus   yes  doctor   recruits  watch   show the thracian we learn  in his absence   act one  attack   act two  attack   spartacus   spartacus   the gods did not piss on me enough for one day   the legadus glaber despise me as a slave   but no  let's join shit the piss  and pour the mouth      if they know that batiatus not  control their men    i had warned      no tell me anything   you will advise and make promises as  my hands  his will    the evil was legadus cum in my gates    the thracian is unpredictable   teach him our rules   cane and whip do not wash   it is an animal  is better to send him mine   no  the other cost little   but spartacus worth much more   its value is much higher the sum of the others   can i return one    if the legadus  himself   even though unpredictable   it is full of passion   but it infuriated is equal to others  a gift to the public to find out how to tame it   struggled to recover that piece of cloth   even when the guards beat him   may prove useful   this was with legadus  saw when he arrived   bring him to my room   try to find what it is   why are you here   in that place under my hospitality   you know why   for trusted in honor of rome   you are here because my grandfather   he built this ludus   believed that no man is worthless   even in the most violent is honor and glory   and these beliefs my father gave me   i am a  lanista   as my father  a trainer of gladiators      i think things in men they even lost   a spark  an ember   and take care of her until igniting the arena   do not burn for another cause is not mine   and what would it be   money   from this point of view cost me a lot      there are reasons simple      a position  power  love   there's a woman  thracian    i have a wife   the love   of course  i can see in his eyes   what is the name this delicate flower    sura  where is she   he took me when i was imprisoned   it takes by legadus glaber   he sold for a syrian   how do you know it still alive   how do you know that the heart still beats in your chest   on most days  i do not know   i'm just a simple roman   you try to follow his path  despite the will of the gods      political      bandidos  although sometimes i can not tell      but you is the most dangerous animals   a beast with a heart   what would you do to insure his wife again   to feel the warmth of your skin  to prove their lips   kill for it   who was among us   how many  100    1000   it would kill everyone   so do the arena   fight for me and for the honor of my ancestors   prove yourself  get to the apex and win their freedom   of course  the woman he lost   i have not lost   she was taken from me   a man has to accept destination      or be destroyed by it   why do i put my fate the hands of another roman   because of that charge      it is your wife   pass the test tonight with honor and servitude   call me dominus and will help them to meet   the choice is yours   cease   i think a draw passed the test   barca   marcus   in position   begin   that was disappointing   not every adventure ends in a climax   a well known for every woman   crixus   spartacus   in position   last lesson before sending it beyond that   begin   drugs   expensive and useless everywhere   fight  bitch thracian   tears   the rabbit is about to pee   kill the rabbit   finish him   thracians   the lesson was well learned   spartacus   cease   passed the test   dominus    your life now meaningless     swear to me     recite the oath gladiator     i offer my flesh  my mind and my will     the glory of ludus     and the will of my master  batiatus    accepted  be burned  chained  beaten      or die by that oath   in search of honor the arena   welcome to the brotherhood
