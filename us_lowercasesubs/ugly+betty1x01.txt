little about myself   magazines are my passion  ever since i was a kid   and i can't imagine a more amazing place  to start my career than meade publications   i know most of your magazines inside out   i try to devour as much as i can   clearly   also  i've learned so much through them   you know  stuff so beyond my world  like    like who the up and comers are on the london art scene  or    or what the political machinations in darfur are all about   or which bali resort is considered the most romantic in the world   and i have tons of ideas   i'm always jotting stuff down on the subway   but i'm getting ahead of myself  sir     all i really want is a chance      good bye      in any position or publication   i can type 100 words a minute   i hate telenovelas   i wanna watch fashion tv   justin  you can watch fashion tv later  when your aunt betty is babysitting  okay   come have some flan   i don't want flan   i'll get fat   honey  you're a boy   it doesn't matter if you're fat or

 you didn't get it   well  they said that they had hired everyone they needed   i don't understand     you're sharp  you're prepared   someone should have begged you to work for them  the day you graduated queens college   betty  have you thought about exploring other options   hilda  i am not going to sell herbalux   well  i wasn't saying that     necessarily     dad    this career is betty's dream   okay  but i hear somebody else has some pretty big dreams  too   what are you talking about   justin  tell your aunt betty what her boyfriend was saying the other night   walter was on his cell phone talking to someone  and he said    she's the one    he wants to marry you   he does   well  would you do it   well  i mean   we haven't talked about that yet  but    well  i think he's a catch  flan   that's him   hi  ignacio  hilda  hi  betty   hey   here   it's a return  the mute doesn't work  but it sounds awesome   thank you   uh       betty  can we talk    yes   sure   oh  um  outside  yeah  okay   celebrity studded funeral services were held today for fey sommers   the much loved and hated editor in chief  of fashion bible  mode  magazine   it was the bitch slap heard 'round the world  when longtime  mode  creative director wilhelmina slater  was passed over for the top spot in favor of daniel meade   the nominally experienced son of meade publications owner  bradford meade   can the notorious manwhore  translate his talent at bedding women  into dressing them   how do you like your new office   you scared me  um     would you just  uh  give me a few minutes  there's some    some things i need to wrap up before i leave   interesting decorating motif   you can get up  he knows you're there   i'd like to introduce you my new assistant     charmaine   i'm sorry to interrupt your    dictation   but this is not the way you run a magazine   what   i'm in love with someone else   but     how  i     i mean  i thought we     well  who is it     gina gambarro    i'm sorry  i        i      no   you don't have to say anything else   good  luck  betty   with everything   are you feeling any better   i'm fine   hello   some guy from meat publications

thank you   bye   assistant to the editor in chief   i didn't know you wanted to work for  mode    well   this wouldn't have been my first choice  but     if i do good here  i can go anywhere in the company   well  just try and dress fashionably   do have anything   actually  i do   oh  my god   hi  you the  before    before and after   the photo shoot   are you delivering something   oh  no  no   i i work here   for   for the new editor in chief   so everyone's in the conference room   and daniel's about to start his first staff meeting     i'm amanda  by the way    betty   okay  f y i   betsy  assistants are usually here before their bosses   oh  well  i was filling out paperwork in h r   yeah  just don't let it happen again   so  uh  where do you come from   queens   what job did you have   oh  actually  apart from internships and part time jobs to pay for school   this is my first real job   that's funny   i was told i didn't have enough experience for the position   it's over there   you are an attractive  intelligent  confident businesswoman   so i gotta confess   i'm probably not gonna remember everyone's names   and i'm really  uh     are you okay   i'm okay  i'm fine  i'm so sorry   i'm sorry   anyway  uh  i wish i wasn't    uh  i wish i wasn't coming in as a new guy under such terrible circumstances   i realize i have some awful big     teeth  shoes to fill   but i can't tell you how excited i am to be working  with such an amazingly talented and dedicated staff   now i'd like to take the moment to talk a little    about some of the ideas     so sorry i'm late   oh  you began without me     sorry  wilhelmina  i waited     shh  marc     gift   thank you  as i was saying  i really wanna    well  aren't you gonna open it   swarovski crystal  to commemorate your first day   thank you   but it is  daniel   not  danny    what   i'm hellaciously upset  marc   oh  my god  i am so sorry   shh  purge this from memory  please   as i was saying  it's a particularly exciting time for me because    i think we need to discuss the fabia cosmetics supplement   fabia cosmetics   the biggest ad buy of the year  and the only paid layout editorial ever works on   well  i'm sure fabia will love whatever we come up with  right   daniel  you  you don't understand   given the new circumstances   fabia needs to sign off on the spread before we go to print   obviously  we're all here to help you succeed   and we've got plenty of ideas   so i think we all need to get back to work to make sure that this    your very first issue with your name on the masthead    sparkles   okay  everyone  let's not dillydally   our editor needs us     killer poncho    thanks   mr  meade   excuse me  um  mr  meade   hi   um  i just wanted to come and introduce myself personally   i'm betty suarez   it's a a pleasure to meet you   hi  betty  um  um     who do you work for   well  um  i work for you   i'm your new assistant   did you get the crease under the hairline   yes  willie   no one has done more  worked harder     i have bled for this magazine   helped make it into the icon it is today   and that nasty  nepotistic son of a bitch gives my job to his     his son   who's a self absorbed  lothario punk who knows nothing about fashion   tell me the truth    is it because i'm getting old   absolutely not  ugh   though you could do with a tad bit more between the brows   so what are you gonna do   just wait and see   well  he's well on his way to falling flat on his face   i mean  can you believe that assistant   this is  mode   not  dog fancy    done   what do you want me to do with the  uh    leftover   all yours   give me a moment  marc   how are you recovering  darling   well  i'm sure you'll feel better  once  uh  everything here starts coming to a boil   here   oh  thank you   what are you doing   um  i'm just gathering information on fabia for daniel   ugh  she is so fabulously douchey   who's he in with   oh  um  phillippe michel   he's  a photographer   oh  he's doing the supplement  isn't he   oh  he's amazing  he's shot  like  everything   yeah  i think   you know  it looks like they're really good friends   oh  well  there had been some drama   daniel hooked up with phillippe's ex girlfriend a couple of years ago   but they're fine now   yeah  we went out for  like  a week   and they don't call him  the tripod  because he's a photographer   if you catch my drift   this is crap   no   no   too down  too out   can't go there   all this is terrible   that's what i thought   phillippe  can i trust you with something   of course  daniel   you know you're like a brother to me   i don't think anyone wants me here  especially wilhelmina   well  that's no secret   i think she's trying to take me in the wrong direction with this fabia layout   do you have any ideas   like  a million   but keep things on the q t   most of these people are still loyal to wilhelmina   and you don't want them mucking things up   um  sorry to interrupt  but can i get you lunch   no  no  but you go ahead  thanks   hi  i'm a really big fan of yours   that travel layout you did with the tiki torches   wow  that was   that was really gorgeous   thank you   yeah  it kind of reminded me of this hiroaki spread  i'd seen a couple of years ago   hey  listen  i don't know who you are or what you're implying   but  um  i would never use another photographer's idea   oh  no  no  no  no  i wasn't   i wasn't saying    um     i i should go   what's the story here   i know the type of women you hire   my  father made me   you're kidding me   look  she appears to be good  capable    fugly  listen to me  you are the editor in chief of  mode  magazine   this business is all image   is that what you want representing you   paparazzi taking your pictures  and she's standing behind   well  i can't fire her  phillippe   well     what if she quits   and how do i get her to do that   you beat her down     to a pulp   hey

all the clothes are kept   i act as an in house seamstress  sort of track of things   sometimes  they even let me keep some of the crappy stuff from last season   but  you know  i have to improvise 'cause everything is a size zero     voila    nice   anyway  well  i like it  mostly 'cause i'm by myself     away from all the chic ees    the chic ees   yeah  the bitches that work at  mode    hey

really overwhelmed right now   but i was wondering  there was something that i just     daniel  you know  i was wondering if you had a quick moment    do i look like i have a  quick moment    no   so sorry   damn it  they forgot one of the outfits   go up to the closet and bring it to set   please   feel the fabric on that thing   it's kind of rough   that's because it's burlap   basically  you're talking  7 000 for a designer potato sack   i can't believe people actually buy this stuff   i can't believe they wear it   and usually just once before they'll chuck it to make room for the next season   but that's fashion   and i've got to say  i love it   oh  you're not too much into it  are you   um  no   not really   so how's it going   um     brutal  huh   well  nothing i do is good

and     some people there were talking  and  uh     well  apparently  bradford was the one that wanted to hire you   bradford meade   wait  he knows who i am   he made daniel hire you     'cause he didn't want his son to be tempted  to sleep with his assistants anymore     oh    i'm sorry  betty     no  that  that explains a lot    betty    no  no  really  it's fine  i should be grateful that i

i'm sorry it didn't work out   it happens   mom said she wasn't surprised   hilda said that   she said all the stuff you wanna do   owning a magazine  doesn't happen for people like us  unless you're j  lo or something   she said she wishes you'd be more realistic  but     i think she's full of crap     hold this    what     what are you doing   i just wanna say that this is really unfair   i live two doors down   i can see you   what the hell you doing   um    where's walter   it's over   look  walter   he's sweet and everything    but i told him from the start i wasn't looking for anything serious   and he said fine  he could still get me 30  off a flat screen   you used him for his discount   oh  he offered   bitch   you broke my plasma   we're so thrilled to have you here  fabia   now  why don't we let the pictures speak for themselves   smettila   this is freaking joke  right   uh  no   you stupido   all of you  stupido   idiots  idiots   what  what just happened    well     fabia's probably still a little sensitive about the accident   accident   oh  you didn't know   about a month ago  she backed her s u v  into 12 people outside marquee   i was in saint tropez   i had no idea   why  why didn't anyone say anything   daniel  if i may  you didn't include me in the concept   and we all thought you knew what you were doing   fabia's not just talking about canceling    the  mode  supplement   she's considering    pulling advertising  from every single one of my magazines   is it true you worked on this on your own   didn't consult wilhelmina or anyone else   look  i can explain   i had  i had a very strong feeling she was trying to sabotage me   the only person who sabotaged you was yourself   sorry i let you down   well  i'm sorry i keep hoping you'll be something you're clearly not     my leg is cramping    look  i can fix this   i'll just present her with a whole new idea   we just closed book  it's too late   tomorrow morning  please   give me another chance   daniel called again looking for you   what part of  unavailable  does he not understand   i'll let him know   he really should've come to me earlier   it wouldn't have made any difference now  would it   not really   to teamwork   to revenge   he has a heart condition   yes  he  he needs his medication   but you can't just cover the pills and then randomly decide to stop   but it's  it's a real person's health  it's not a case number   give me the phone  i'll let 'em have it   no  no  i don't wanna hold again  not again   no  just wait    it's fine  we'll just   we'll get 'em tomorrow  it's fine   thank you  mi amor   you're so much better at dealing with this bureaucratic stuff than i am   no  you know i don't mind   i know   you're always so good to me   so strong  determined  optimistic     just like your mother was   why haven't you returned my calls   i've been busy   betty  i need to talk to you  i made a terrible mistake   wait  did you realize this before or after gina dumped you   what  no  no  i broke up with her   betty  it was wrong  and i wanna make this up to you  i    betty   are you dating someone   walter  please go   dating this guy   look  you need to go  please  you need to go   but  betty  i i     what are you doing here   i wanna talk   it's a nice place   yeah  we're just in between interior designers     really    no   oh  right  it's a joke   betty  i am so sorry   you didn't deserve what i put you through   i i listened to all the wrong people about a lot of things  and     i have no one to blame but myself   well  i appreciate that  daniel   but you're going to leave here   and you're going to take your town car back to your soho loft   and i'm still gonna be here    out of work  and dealing with problems that you'll never understand   try me  betty  come on  we've all got problems   oh  and what are yours  daniel   what restaurant you're gonna eat at  which model you're gonna sleep with   try spending the day on the phone with some crappy h m o    getting them to cover your dad's prescriptions   or try lining up a job  any job    'cause you have to help pay the rent next month   look     i lost a brother a while back   he was the good one in our family  and i've never quite measured up   but i am trying   betty  i  i could never compare my problems to yours   but they're mine   nothing's ever easy   i saw the layout you made for fabia   you did   i thought it was very smart  and beautiful   well  thank you   i want to take your ideas to fabia   giving you credit  of course   and i really want you to come back  be my assistant   i promise you things will be different   i  daniel  i  i mean  i i really have to think about that   well    you have tonight   otherwise  i'll probably be out of a job as well   did you hear that   every word   so    where the hell is he   he said 10 00 a m   well  fabia    on behalf of the entire magazine   ci perdoni   this whole thing has been unacceptable   marc   now that i have a moment of your time  i'd like to show you some of my ideas   sorry we're late   there was obviously no time for a new photo shoot  so  uh   what we're gonna be showing you is just a rough idea   oh  uh  wait  no  this is  this is not the right file   um  just one sec  one second   this is it   um    in order to show the softer side of fabia cosmetics   we're going to use the concept of mothers and daughters   focusing on the small  special moments that    that are usually taken for granted   the theme being   it's not the big events    but the little moments  that matter   i just had a daughter   i do none of those things     but i can understand   what makes you think this is going to appeal to my customers   um  well  if  if i may  i do have the statistics here   um  though one might assume that your demographic is very young   in fact  there's been tremendous brand loyalty since you've launched   which means that the people who were teenagers  when they began using your cosmetics   well  now  like you  they are     beginning to settle down and have children    um  58  to be exact   and you could do this in time   of course   uh  did you want to approve the  uh  uh  models and images beforehand   nah  just make sure it's not too sappy   do a picture where they're pulling their hair or biting each other   so that's nice   now i go   good work     oh  the idea was actually     his best one  don't you think   indeed   welcome back  boss   marc   i'm very unhappy   it's a setback   but it's just a matter of time   once he's out of the picture   the company will be ours for the taking   considering the way everything's played out   it seems to me that you should keep an eye on that damn ugly assistant   what's her name   betty     betty    betty   betty   betty  betty   oh  christina  thank you again  so much   no  no  no  go  go   you should've let me tell him it was your idea   don't worry  i will the next time     thanks    you're welcome   so i've confirmed your lunch for tomorrow  and your 3 15 with the graphics department is set     the feature editor would like     betty     tomorrow morning  it's okay   good night     well  her face is a map of the world     is a map of the world      you can see she's a beautiful girl     she's a beautiful girl      suddenly i see     suddenly i see      this is what i wanna be      suddenly i see     suddenly i see      why the hell it     means so much to me      suddenly i see     this is what i wanna be       transcript   raceman
