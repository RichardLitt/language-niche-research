have c f   mom   mm  i have    i have heard of it  but i don't know  what it is  exactly  i don't know   well  cystic fibrosis is when your lungs  create a lot of this thick mucous   and it makes it really hard to breathe    some would say impossible   i'm on a list for a lung transplant   but that comes with its own demons   and god knows if i'll ever get one in time   well  i hope you do   what is your life expectancy  emma   maybe 27   hmm   well  why don't you two go upstairs   do your homework   and you let me know if you get hungry   do you think that she has to take that thing  out of her nose when they make out   how about this  the tiger   it's a classic    tiger  tiger  burning bright   in the forest of the night    what immortal hand or eye  could frame thy fearful symmetry    and what does it mean   it's about how could a god   who made all this beautiful stuff in the world   also make things that are scary and evil   it could work   we could talk about it in terms  of famous contemporary murders   like o j  or   or charles manson    what the hammer  what the chain    in what furnace was thy brain    what the anvil  what dread grasp   dare its deadly terrors clasp    what's this   oh  it's nothing   i don't care   wow  these pictures are amazing   did you draw these   no  no  i found it in one of the motel rooms   i didn't know what to do with it  so    oh  please  i've read a lot of manga    a lot steamier than this   can i borrow it   sure   thanks   good evening  gentlemen  sorry to be in a robe   you caught me getting ready for bed   yeah  we need to ask you some questions   sure  sure  ask away   the other morning when we were out here   you said you hadn't seen keith summers   yes  that's correct   but we have an eyewitness who was driving by here  who said he saw him  standing right here on your front lawn  and that you and your son were talking to him     and it looked a little heated   well  yes  i mean  i'm    i didn't know that you had meant had i ever seen him   i thought you meant recently   well  some people might think  in the last week as being recently   yeah  some people might   so you're admitting you did see him   no  i never said i hadn't ever seen him   so i'm not admitting anything   did he make any   any threats to you or    threats  no  why if he had  i would've called the police   because he wasn't too happy about you waltzing in  and buying his property at a foreclosure   well  you know  the fact  that i bought this property at a good price  hardly incriminates me in his disappearance   he disappeared   i i don't remember bringing up a disappearance   no  but you're implying it   no  i believe you're inferring it   that's all the information i have  so       is that it    actually  no   i'd like to take a look around  if you don't mind   actually  i do mind   i think you need a search warrant  for something like that  right   i mean  based on something  more than just some meaningless conversation  out on my motel front lawn  right   you better work with me  okay   i'm the last guy you want on your bad side   okay       baby girl  don't be shy          i don't wanna be the          bad guy          i don't wanna be your sleepwalk dance anymore          i just wanna see some      deputy shelby   hey  you guys be safe today  yeah     hello  mrs  bates    hello  go ahead   slap the handcuffs on   well  that is romero   that's just his style  you know   he's a dog with a bone   so i wouldn't take it too personally   yeah  i tell you  it's a little hard not to   i know   well  i'm sorry  um     hey  would you let me buy you a cup of coffee   maybe  as a gesture of goodwill   sure     yeah    yeah   it was horrible for norman to lose his father   and i came here because i wanted  to clean the slate for him   you know  i wanted him    i wanted to give him a new life     i wanted to give him hope    sure  yeah   and let's just say  that gets a little bit compromised  when sheriff bulldog is standing on my porch  and he's making all kinds of accusations   first of all  to be fair   i really don't think he was making accusations   i do  no  i do think that you were inferring that   oh  no   now we're back to that again   okay  romero   he grew up with keith summers   they were boyhood pals  you know   so they spent a lot of time together  doin' a whole lot of nothing   and you get close to people that way  so    so keith's disappearance  you know  this is    it's very personal to him   i can understand that   hey  deputy   we gonna see you at the woodchuck tonight   absolutely  yeah  wouldn't miss it     right on  man    all right   woodchuck  what on earth is the woodchuck   yeah  the woodchuck is this stupid   but very fun  local sort of festival   it's left over from when this used to be a logging town     sounds charming    yeah  no  it is  actually   it is  you should come   yeah  okay  i would love to   great   um     i just   i really can't    i mean  i couldn't take you   you know  'cause of the whole keith summers  the whole    but  i mean  we could meet there  right   because  i mean    i'm going   you're going  so     just a thought   how does this look   for what   i'm meeting deputy shelby in town   does this top look like i'm trying too hard   that depends on what you're trying   ah  i didn't want to have to tell you this   i didn't want you to worry   the police came by last night   apparently someone saw us talking to keith summers outside  after i specifically told the police  that we hadn't seen him  mom  that's   i know  it's not good   i think i dodged it for the moment   but i don't think it's over   deputy seems to like us   so i'm gonna go on a goodwill mission   i'm meeting him at a community event in town   hmm   norman  please   i'm just doing what i need to do   this one's better  right   lord  norman  i'm your mother   it's not like it's weird or anything   you don't have to do this  mom   wait  wait  wait  i'm not  doing  anything   i ran into him in town   and i'm just gonna go hang out for a bit   no  i don't want you to go     honey  you're overreacting    fine     it's a community thing    yes     i'll go with you    no     yeah    no   no  you're not going with me  and you know it   it's fine  norman   it doesn't mean anything   it's not like i'm actually interested in him   i don't want you to worry about this   i don't want you to worry about anything   that's why i'm doing this     okay  mom    okay   it's all gonna be good   hey  gil   this is dylan massett   he's the guy i was telling you about   so  dylan     you know how to use a gun   yeah     what's for dinner  honey    screw off   and i didn't make it  mom made it   crap  we're out of beer   apparently  the whore  is calling you   hi  norma   yeah  i met with the plumber   and i got the quotes for the new toilets   yeah  it's in the kitchen   okay  fine  fine  yes   don't you ever call our mother a whore   get the hell off of me   what do you think you're doing   you're a damn joke  norman   you let that bitch run you like a puppet   she doesn't run me  she cares about me   and she's not a bad person   she's just not perfect   at least she tries  you son of a bitch   you don't get it  do you  norman   she's ruined you   if you hate her so much  why the hell  do you wanna stay here   because i've got nowhere else to go   but don't you come at me again  or i will hurt you bad   do you understand   i told you not to do that   she's not a whore     great job    that's awesome       i can see why you think      great job  man  just awesome     look at you    oh   see  i told you  this is   it's stupid   you know  there are a million reasons  why keith summers could have disappeared   he probably landed in a ditch somewhere  as a result of some bad crap that he got into   you mean  illegal stuff   let's just say that he was a train wreck in general       amie      you know  i had such high hopes  when i came here to make a home for me and norman   and things just keep happening  weird things   you know   it's like this  but   it's not like this   look  nowhere is like this   i mean  not all the way through   have you noticed what these people do for a living   artisanal cheese  organic pig farms   and yet  most of these people  somehow   they're all living in million dollar homes   they're driving european cars   the town  it was built on the logging industry   but all that collapsed with the tree huggers   i'm just saying that there are     there's different ways to produce an economy   and it's not always what it seems   but surely you can't allow illegal things   bad things to happen here   the people in this town   they deal with things in a different way   but it gets dealt with   and what about the guy who was burned   it'll be dealt with  an eye for an eye   it'll get handled   the boat sails for new york in 20 minutes     let it sail    look  mastermind   the tour is over   we've been posse baitin'  every town from coast to coast   and we just ran out of towns   norman   what on earth happened to you   oh  dylan and i just got into a fight   it's not a big deal   it absolutely is a big deal   look at your sweet face   this is awful  what happened   i don't even know  mom   we just don't get along   he's gonna have to leave   he can't come into our lives  and disrupt them like this   he can't talk to us the way he does   and he can't hurt you  i will not stand for it   i won't   maybe it would be the best thing   get some sleep  sweetheart   oh  hey  cool  you came   you said it was important   holy crap  what happened to your face   oh  i fell down the stairs  you know   those long stairs in front of our house   it's okay   you don't have to tell me   thanks   so what's with all the stuffed animals   are they real   they were once   my dad does it   he's one of the best taxidermy artists on the west coast   but enough about stuffing dead animals   sit down   i'm gonna tell you a little story  about real  living things   four girls from shunyi  china   get told that  if they come to america illegally  and work as housemaids  they will get citizenship  in seven years   but they aren't gonna be maids   they are forced to have sex with different men every day   one of them dies from an overdose   they force the other girls to carry her body  into the hills  dig a grave  and then bury her  by a shed in the trees   this is a pretty wild story   wild  yes  and not over   so eventually  after they have been sampled   they are sold one by one into sex slavery   look at this   that's ladyface   it's a mountain just outside of white pine bay   my dad's shown it to me before   it really exists   and   someone did this to these girls  norman   and we can prove it   we can find the spot and find the grave   then we'll know if it's real or not   this is all a little peculiar   no  you know what's peculiar   a 17 year old boy using the word  peculiar    so you in       you see this guy          this guy's in love with you          yes  i'm in love          who looks at you the way i do          when you smile          i can tell          we know each other very well          how can i show you          i'm glad      what are you doing   it's the middle of the night   just having a cocktail and listening  to some of the previous owner's old music   you   hey  i saw what you did to norman   you can't stay here  you're toxic   you're leaving in the morning   how did sam die  norma   you know  it's funny   because i had to do a lot of research to find out  where you guys had moved to   and i wound up talking to one of the insurance people   and they talked  about how sad it was that sam had died  and what a wonderful husband and father he was   and then  i thought  you know   hmm    wouldn't it be interesting  if i told them what life with sam was really like    you know  how you guys got along and all       tell me now          is it so          don't let me be the last to know      just keep the music down       don't let          my heart keep breakin'          'cause i need your love      you're right  that's it   see  it's real   let's go   crap  this is a big mountain   where's that shed   we should take a break for a second   it's okay for you to be doing this  right   totally   fine   i'm okay   it's cool up here   my dad  he taught me this meditation  where first you imagine your spirit  rising up out of your body   then out of your house   out of your town  out of the sky   like a golden light zooming and growing   out into  and even past  the universe   and from that point  you look back  and you realize how small you are in the world   don't you feel like that up here  norman   that you're connected to something  so much larger than ourselves   what the hell is that   holy crap   it's one of the pot fields  i've heard about them   but i've never actually seen one   what pot fields  what are you talking about   hey  hey   what the hell are you doing there   emma  we need to run     hey  hey    we need to run   come on  come on  emma   shh  get down  don't even breathe
