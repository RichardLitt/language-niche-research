this place amazing   welcome   woman  it's a classic l a  victorian   built around 1920 by the doctor to the stars at the time   it's just fabulous   these are real tiffany fixtures   as you can see  the previous owners  really loved this place like a child   they restored everything   gay   what do you think   tiffany  wow   do you cook  viv is a great cook   i got her cooking lessons a few years ago   and she ended up teaching the teacher a few things   cooking lessons   romantic   aren't you a psychologist  psychiatrist   you said something on the phone about there being a study  that i could use as a home office   i'm planning on seeing patients here   so i can spend more time with the family   how refreshing     violet  honey  would you go see where hayley went  thank you   what are you yapping at         ben  when i saw the pictures of this room online   i thought maybe you could use it  as your music room   are you a musician   i was   cellist   very good one  in fact   why did you quit   this wallpaper is peeling over here   looks like maybe there's a mural  underneath it   the last owners probably  covered it up   they were modernists   speaking of the last owners   full disclosure requires that i tell you  about what happened to them   oh  god     they didn't die in here or anything  did they   yes  actually  both of them   murder suicide   i sold them the house  too   they were just the sweetest couple   you never know  i guess  ben  that explains why  it's half the price of every other house  in the neighborhood  i guess   i do have a very nice mid century ranch  but it's  in the valley  and you're going to get  a third of the house for twice the price   right   where did it happen   the basement   we'll take it   ben  come on  babe   let's go to bed   leave that for the morning   i'm a little bit worried about violet   you know  these kids here are very different   i don't know if she can handle another year of not fitting in   you mean    you can't   can't believe this place doesn't freak you out a little bit   'cause of what happened here   my repulsion is tempered by the fact  that this house is worth four times what we paid for it   so let's not think about it   this is your professional advice  doctor   just denial   come on  let me give you a little love   moving here  buying this house  was the exact right thing to do  for us and our family   it's a good thing  and we deserve some good after all the shit  we've been through   i've got some stuff i want to     unpack down in the kitchen   i appreciate that you're trying   i'm

star   did the screen tests and everything  but     nudity was the big deal then   the morals were just beginning to collapse   and i wasn't about to have my green pasture  flashed 70 feet high  for every man  woman  and child to see   so i took that little butterfly of a dream  and put it in a jar on the shelf   and  uh  soon after  came the mongoloid  and  of course  i couldn't work after that   it has been so great to meet you   i just   you know   i wasn't prepared for guests at all   i'm gone   oh  i brought you this   you know  a little  um   housewarming  thank you   addy wanted to bake

so  tate  these fantasies started  two years ago  three years ago  when   two years ago   it's always the same   it starts the same way   how  tell me   i prepare for the noble war     i'm calm  i know the secret  i know what's coming   and i know no one can stop me  including myself   ben  do you target people who have been  mean to you or unkind   i kill people i like   can i help you   some of them beg for their life   i don't feel sad   i don't feel anything   it's a filthy world we live in   it's a filthy goddamn helpless world   and honestly  i feel like i'm helping to take them away  from the shit  and the piss and the vomit that run in the streets   i'm helping  to take them somewhere clean  and kind   there's something  about all that blood  man   i drown in it   the indians believed that blood holds all the bad spirits   and once a month in ceremonies they would cut themselves  to let the spirits go free   there's something  smart about that   very smart  i like that   you think i'm crazy   no   i think you're creative   and i think you have a lot of pain you're not dealing with   my mother's probably worried about me  right   i'm sure she is   she's a cocksucker   i mean  literally  a cocksucker   she used to suck the guy off next door  all the time   my dad found out  and he left   he left me alone with a cocksucker   can you imagine   how sick is that   i've heard a lot worse   cool   can you tell me some   i like stories   no  i can't   the world is a filthy place   it's a filthy goddamn horror show   there's so much pain  you know   there's so much   you're doing it wrong   if you're trying to kill yourself  cut vertically   they can't stitch that up   how'd you get in here   if you're trying to kill yourself   you might also try locking the door                 what are you doing   am i on a trip   can i help you   i'm moira o'hara   i'm the housekeeper   oh   i didn't know the place came with a housekeeper   why are you hanging your sheets  with a perfectly good electric dryer inside   i don't like all those chemicals in the fabric softeners   so i just like to do it naturally   i work monday through thursday   thanksgiving on  christmas off   um    that was the deal with the last fellows   i'm sorry  i'm just not sure  that we're gonna need a housekeeper   what have you been using to clean the floorboards   murphy's oil soap   oh  no   white vinegar   oil soap kills the wood   i like that better  it's more natural   have you ever owned a house this old before   no   it has a personality  feelings   mistreat it  and you'll regret it   may i come in   my cab's left  and i'd like to call another   so  you worked for the previous owners   i've been the housekeeper here for years   they come  they go  i stay   they were both nice boys   the ones before you   i found the bodies   what happened   i mean  i hate to gossip     they fought a lot   money  i think   but who can know when something so horrible happens   sometimes people just go mad   i cleaned the mess   you'd never know   can i ask you a personal question   do you ever get tired  of cleaning up other peoples' messes   we're women  it's what we do   i just get paid for it   yes     oh  hey  this is my husband ben   ben  this is moira o'hara   she was the housekeeper for the previous owner   nice to meet you    that's my cab   i'll use the lavatory first  if you don't mind   sure   what do you think   what  you you    you want to hire her   yeah  i mean  she's a little kooky  but she seems  trustworthy  she knows the house really well   and i feel like i could just use the help     so    can you start tomorrow   thursday's better  but i'll make it work   okay  and you know  moira   you don't have to wear the housekeeper's uniform   you can just wear your own clothes   i don't like cleaning peoples' houses in my own clothes     what   nothing  just     you just always surprise me   i like that     you're gonna have to forgive me one day   you mind if i tape this   tate  no   you taking your medications   yes   any side effects   i was taking them at night  but they kept me up   and what did you do   started taking them in the morning   light sensitivity is pretty common   maybe   yeah  i think so   when i was in medical school   they brought in this cia interrogator  to help us better identify who was lying   this guy was  like   six foot  50  crew cut   he must have been one hell of an interrogator   because i'll tell you something   i'd be terrified to lie to him   you think i'm lying to you   light sensitivity isn't a side effect of lexapro  tate   so you lied to me   what is important    that is if you're telling the truth  about doing these things to your classmates   if you were actually a danger  to society  the law says  that i have to report you to the police   did you call them   not yet   i've treated psychotics before  and people  with the right combination of chemical imbalance  and psychological damage that can't be reached   you think that's me   you think i can't get better   you   you kidding me   you're hopeless     everybody can get better  tate   everybody   i just think you're scared   of what  i'm not sure yet   maybe rejection   certainly  because of what your father did to you   i was afraid my big dick wouldn't work   what     yeah  that's why i didn't take the meds   tate  i was afraid

thanks   this thing doesn't tweak you out   there's something about it that i find    really comforting   one of my psych professors told me that people  tell stories to cope with their fears   all art and myths are just creations  to give us some sense of control over the things we're scared of   afraid of dying  create reincarnation   afraid of evil  create a benevolent god  who sends evildoers to hell   i think i just like that i don't have to think while i do it   okay   i always thought you were prettiest like this   no makeup  messy hair   a little sweaty   i'm old   stop   you're beautiful   you are   no   ben     violet won't be home for an hour   no  okay  ben  no   come on  babe  ben     no   sorry  just no   how long  viv   how long are you going to punish me for

less fortunate  more tolerable is  in my opinion  a public service   look  you want her to leave you alone   stop making your life a living hell   short of killing her  there's only one solution   scare her  make her afraid of you   it's the only thing bullies react to   how  it's simple   you simply walk up to her and say   here's the deal  i need you to stop harassing me   i got what you want  drugs   come to my house tomorrow for your free sample   i'm a dealer  and a good one  i got the best shit in town   she's a cokehead  i don't have coke   you won't need any  it's just an excuse to get her here   after that  she'll leave empty handed and terrified   and i promise you  you'll never be bothered by her again   how am i going to terrify her  helter skelter   that's where i come in   hot   i thought i told you to throw that thing away   oh  you're not talking   well  i'll give you points for creativity   we were pretty hot this afternoon   you really want to go for round two  huh

if you're screwing with me     it's just the basement   i found the best hiding place   this is great shit  too   all the coke coming to the u s  from central america  smuggled in on lobster boats in gloucester   i used to show my boobs to the lobstermen  in return for a key or two before they cut it   so where is it   right around the corner   to the right   this place is a dump   oh  shut up   i

they're not gonna put me back into jail   i have brain cancer   terminal  inoperable   i'm sorry   don't be  that's the only reason they let me out   homicide  triple homicide   i was in that house for six months  before i started hearing voices   my wife thought i was working too hard   my daughter angie was six   the older one  margaret  was ten   she looked like her mother   that's funny how
