i have running water in a toilet    some guy to  chang  chang    i seduced a harp player   a harp player  a harp player   he goes   she's young  cute    he goes   oh  she doesn't work here    waitresses there hate  me since then   is that bad   i said to her    you're my sister  and i want to do open mics    yes  honest to god   behind a dunkin' donuts   okay  okay  okay   okay  sorry   deal  all right   all right  two gets a nine  that's flushing   queen gets a jack   wait  is this high low  yes  it's high low   you know what you can do with this seven   shove it straight up your mother's shit maker   i don't think it'll fit there   her ass is so crammed with all the dicks  she finds behind the bus station   that doesn't even make any sense   see  what nick is saying  is that your mother goes to the bus station  and she gets  like  old  thrown away penises there   like  out back  where they keep those   like in a bin   she does this so much  her ass is just crammed   your mom really does that   i don't know  i don't talk to her every day   let me finish   she just crams 'em into there  and uses one of those coffee tampers  you know   for espresso machines   you know  i got it earlier  but now i    wait a minute  i'm not finished   and she just shoves 'em in there  just    it's just compressed   it's like she's almost crushing dicks into like a dick diamond   like a pink diamond   and so  you know  try to get a card in there   okay  that does make sense   what's that feel like  anyways  what   a dick in the ass   you're asking me because i'm gay   no  i'm asking you 'cause you're very learned   yeah  i'm asking you 'cause you're the only gay person here   are you interested for any particular reason   you need a breath mint  my friend   hey  rick   is it true there's a gay club in the city called  jerks   where gay guys just stand around all day  and play with each other's dicks   yeah  city jerks  oh  my god   what is wrong with you people   wait  there's really a club like that   it's not a club  per se  it's like a floating party   it meets in different locations every week  and what goes on there   jesus  do we need to hear this   why don't you just shut up and learn something   hey  why don't you shut up   nice one  don't want to   city jerks is a gathering  sometimes in a hotel room   sometimes at a club and  you know  different places   and it started  basically  when aids did   they wanted to have a club where guys could have   like a group sexual outlet  but still play safe   you know  so at this    you know  at these meetings  they get together   some guys go one on one  some guys go in a huddle   like do what  what goes on   you masturbate each other  oh  jesus   i thought masturbation meant only one person   so you just stand around in a room  and you jerk each other off   yeah  that's why they call it  city jerks    well  you could just watch   a lot of guys like to watch  while another guy pleasures himself   stop   stop telling this   i'm gonna puke   is there a lesser charge for watching  like standing room   no  no  no   like auditing a class  no  because you're never    what's a  huddle    you said  huddle   what's that   it's a huddle  where you huddle together in a group  and everybody reaches in and you kind of help yourself   to cocks and balls  sure   oh  my god  what    what are they in   jesus christ  what are you people thinking   out of the huddle   like   you jerk him  you jerk him   break     break     on two   on two   what do you do if you're there and somebody recognizes you   say hi   well  you'll be pleased to know  everybody's naked   except for shoes and socks   really  why the shoes and socks   well  after awhile  the floor is full of    all right   i get it   christ   that much   you gotta put on some shoes   like high   like timberlands  you need some big shoes   no  just regular shoes with a rubber sole   sure   something stylish  though  still   florsheim has some stuff  you know   snowshoes or something    flippers  flip flops   flip flops   mud cleats   that's another club   that's one of jim's clubs   mud cleats   you know  i know it's a free country  rick   and i don't care what you guys do  but     thanks  nick   next time i'm about to go down on a big juicy cock   i'll remember  it's all right with you   you should have that stamped on the head of the cock    nick approved    nick's face   nick approved    like i said  i don't care and god bless you   but i gotta be honest   what you guys do  it really makes me sick   and not on a political bible level  either   i mean  just picturing you touch another guy's dick   that's gross   is that how you feel about what we do   what  sex with women   yeah  do you get grossed out thinking about pussy   i don't think about pussy   i don't care what you guys do   you're the ones who asked me   and you guys ask me this shit every time i'm here   really  i talk about gay sex more with you guys  than i do with any of my gay friends   you guys are obsessed   well  i'm curious   i don't know that i'm obsessed   really   you  who says  faggot  onstage more than you say  hello     hello    who says  hello  more than once onstage   who says  hello  onstage at all   yeah  hello   i mean in life  in life  he says    more than he says it in life   rick  does it offend you when i say that word   what word   hello   no   faggot    yeah  does it bother you when he says the word  faggot    no  it bothers me when you say it   'cause you mean it   yeah  but really  it's like  as a comedian and a gay guy   you're the only gay comic i know   do you think i shouldn't be using that word onstage   i think you should use whatever word you want   when you use it onstage   i can see it's funny and i don't care   but are you interested to know what it might mean to gay men   yeah  i am interested   well  the word  faggot  really means a bundle of sticks  used for kindling in a fire   now  in the middle ages   when they used to burn people they thought were witches   they used to burn homosexuals  too   and they used to burn the witches at a stake   but they thought the homosexuals were too low and disgusting  to be given a stake to be burned on   so they used to just throw them in with the kindling   with the other  faggots    so that's how you get  flaming faggot    so what you're saying is gay people  are a good alternative fuel source   that's where they get the term  diesel dyke    i'm sorry  go ahead   you might want to know that every gay man in america  has probably had that word shouted at them  when they're being beaten up   sometimes many times   sometimes by a lot of people all at once   so when you say it   it kind of brings that all back up   but  you know  by all means  use it  get your laughs   but  you know  now you know what it means   okay  thanks  faggot  we'll keep that in mind        louie  louie  louie  louie          louie  louie  louie louaaa          louie  louie  louie  louie          louie  louie you're gonna cry          louie  louie louie louaaa      sync by honeybunny  getting divorced is like a    it's like stepping out of a time

kind of time machine  where it takes the real amount of time  to take you to the future   it's basically just a    like  if a time machine was a box  that you get in and sit in it for two years  and

ever said   you should not have sex with animals    i would totally have sex with animals all of the time   the only reason i don't have sex with animals  is 'cause i'm not supposed to and somebody told it to me   i would totally have sex with most monkeys  probably   why not   no  you know what  i wouldn't  for one reason   'cause i think it would be rape   i don't think any animal is attracted to any human being   i don't think it's morally wrong  i really don't   except for that i don't think the animal's into it   if you can get an animal horny  go ahead  man   go ahead and  it   if you can    if you can finger a monkey and the monkey's like    ooh      get in there  man  you earned it   you earned it   i really think if there was    if i was alone on the earth   if i found myself alone on planet earth   no other humans   i would have sex with a monkey in  like  two minutes   two minutes   that's really not long enough to be sure you're alone  on the earth  even   that's   that's  like  getting a little    i walk outside  it's   there's not much traffic    oh  my god  it's just me    i'm gonna have sex with a monkey right now   oh  no  that's a person    is it bad to brush your teeth after you suck a guy's dick   because then it causes blood  and you can actually catch aids that way   is it better just to not do anything   that's actually a legitimate question   that is legitimate  i know it's a good question   i want to know why you're bringing it up here   because the pulp from your teeth    what are you doing that you gotta ask that   you guys think it might be funny   but i think about that all the time   what are you   is there cock meat all over your mirror  in the bathroom after you floss   no  i have a good imagination   i can visualize it   i don't need the meat to actually be on the mir  i mean  it     i thought you meant cock meat 'cause you're flossing your    that's what i meant  that's what i mean   sync by honeybunny
