 why are you late   you're not going to like the answer   i already know the answer   i missed the bus   i don't doubt it  no bus stops near brad's   you spent the night  the alarm didn't work  or maybe it did   i didn't sleep with him     girl  there's      i missed the bus   there's something either very wrong with you  or there's something very wrong with him   there's nothing wrong with him   please tell me you know that for a fact   melanie  i gotta go   you're lying aren't you   i wouldn't lie to you   good morning guys   good morning miss rebecca   everybody's in their seats   yes   ok  sidney  why don't you tell us what you did this weekend   come on  sidney  we know you're not shy   how come we always have to tell you what we did  and you never tell us what you did   ok  i had a really great weekend  but you can't tell miss melanie  ok   what did you do   i made a new friend   it's so much fun to make new friends  isn't it   yeah  yes  ect   did you tell you mom and dad about your new friend   absolutely  you should never keep anything from your parents   and i told them  wh    c  a  l  h  e   the    we know that word   the    call the nurse  original airdate on fox   november 16  2004   babbled like a baby  present deterioration of mental status   see that  they all assume i'm a patient because of this cane   so put on a white coat like the rest of us   i don't want them to think i'm a doctor   you see where the administration might have a problem with that attitude   people don't want a sick doctor   fair enough  i don't like healthy patients  the 29 year old female  the one who can't talk  i liked that part   she's my cousin   and your cousin doesn't like the diagnosis   i wouldn't either  brain tumor  she's gonna die  boring   no wonder you're such a renowned diagnostician  you don't need to actually know anything to figure out what's wrong   you're the oncologist  i'm just a lowly infectious disease guy   hah  yes  just a simple country doctor  brain tumors at her age are highly unlikely   she's 29  whatever she's got is highly unlikely   protein markers for the three most prevalent brain cancers came up negative   that's an hmo lab  you might as well have sent it to a high school kid with a chemistry set   no family history   i thought your uncle died of cancer   other side  no environmental factors   that you know of   and she's not responding to radiation treatment   none of which is even close to dispositive   all it does is raise one question   your cousin goes to an hmo   come on  why leave all the fun for the coroner   what's the point of putting together a team if you're not going to use them   you've go three overqualified doctors working for you  getting bored   it's a lesion   and the big green thing in the middle of the bigger blue thing on a map is an island   i was hoping for something a bit more creative   shouldn't we be speaking to the patient before we start diagnosing   is she a doctor   no  but     everybody lies   dr  house doesn't like dealing with patients   isn't treating patients why we became doctors   no  treating illnesses is why we became doctors  treating patients is what makes most doctors miserable   so you're trying to eliminate the humanity from the practice of medicine   if you don't talk to them they can't lie to us   and we can't lie to them   humanity is overrated   i don't think it's a tumor   first year of medical school if you hear hoof beets you think  horses  not  zebras    are you in first year of medical school   no  first of all  there's nothing on the cat scan   second of all  if this is a horse then the kindly family doctor in trenton makes the obvious diagnosis and it never gets near this office   differential diagnosis  people  if it's not a tumor what are the suspects   why couldn't she talk   aneurysm  stroke  or some other ischemic syndrome   get her a contrast mri   creutzfeld jakob disease   mad cow   mad zebra   wernickie's encephalopathy   no  blood thiamine level was normal   lab in trenton could have screwed up the blood test   i assume it's a corollary if people lie  that people screw up   re draw the blood tests   and get her scheduled for that contrast mri asap   let's find out what kind of zebra we're dealing with here   i was expecting you in my office 20 minutes ago   really  well  that's odd  because i had no intention of being in your office 20 minutes ago   you think we have nothing to talk about   no  just that i can't think of anything that i'd be interested in   i sign your paychecks   i have tenure   are you going to grab my cane now  stop me from leaving   that would be juvenile   i can still fire you if you're not doing your job   i'm here from 9 to 5   your billings are practically nonexistent   rough year   you ignore requests for consults   i call back  sometimes i misdial   you're 6 years behind on your obligation to this clinic   see  i was right  this doesn't interest me    it's 5 00  i'm going home   to what   nice   look  dr  house  the only reason that i don't fire you is  because your reputation still worth something to this hospital   excellent  we have a point of agreement  you aren't going to fire me   your reputation won't last up if you don't do your job   the clinic is part of your job  i want you to do your job   well  like the philosopher jagger once said   you can't always get what you want    you aren't my doctor  are you  dr  house   thankfully no  i'm dr  chase   dr  house is the head of diagnostic medicine   he's very busy  but he has taken a keen interest in your case   we inject gadolinium into a vein   it distributes itself throughout your brain and acts as a contrast material for the magnetic resonance imagery   basically  whatever's in your head  lights up like a christmas tree   it might make you feel a little light headed   dr  cameron  i'm sorry i have to stop you  there's a problem   you pulled my authorization   yes  why are you yelling   no mris  no imaging studies  no labs   you also can't make long distance phone calls   if you're gonna fire me at least have the guts to face me   or photocopies  you're still yelling   i'm angry  you're risking a patient's life   i assume those are two separate points   you showed me disrespect  you embarrassed me and as long as i'm still work here you have no  is your yelling designed to scare me because i'm not sure what i'm supposed to be scared of   more yelling  that's not scary   that you're gonna hurt me  that's scary  but i'm pretty sure i can outrun ya   oh  i looked into that philosopher you quoted  jagger  and you're right    you can't always get what you want   but as it turns out   if you try sometimes you get what you need    so  because you want me to treat patients  you aren't letting me treat patients   i need you to do your job   do the mri  she folded   i've gotta do four hours a week in this clinic until i make up the time i've missed    2054   i'll be caught up in 2054   you better love this cousin a whole lot   all right rebecca  we know you may feel a little claustrophobic in there  but we need you to remain still   ok  we're gonna begin   i don't feel so good   it's all right  just try to relax   rebecca    rebecca   rebecca  get her out of there   ah she probably fell asleep  she's exhausted   she was claustrophobic 30 seconds ago  she's not sleeping  we got to get her out of there   it'll just be another minute   she's having an allergic reaction to gadolinium  she'll be dead in two minutes   hold her neck   oh  she's ashen   she's not breathing  epi point five   come on  i can't ventilate   too much edema  where's the surgical airway kit   yep  coming   good call   we'll get that tube out of your throat later today   just get some rest for now  ok   told you  can't trust people   she probably knew she was allergic to gadolinium  figured it was an easy way to get someone to cut a hole in her throat   can't get a picture  gonna have to get a thousand words   you actually want me to talk to the patient  get a history   we need to know if there's some genetic or environmental causes triggering an inflammatory response   i thought everybody lied   truth begins in lies  think about it   that doesn't mean anything does it    do you have cable tv here somewhere   general hospital starts in 8 minutes   no tv  but we've got patients   can't you give out the aspirin yourself  i'll do paperwork   i made sure your first case was an interesting one   cough just won't go away  runny nose looks a funny color   patient admitted complaining of back spasms   i think i read about something like that in the new england journal of medicine   patient is orange   the color   no  the fruit   you mean yellow  it's jaundice   i mean orange   well  how orange   exam room 1   i was playing golf and my cleat got stuck   i mean  it hurt a little but i kept playing   the next morning i could barely stand up   well  you're smiling so i take it that means this isn't serious   what's that  what are you doing   painkillers   oh  for you  for your leg   no  'cause they're yummy  you want one  it'll make your back feel better   unfortunately  you have a deeper problem   your wife is having an affair   what    you're orange  you moron   it's one thing for you not to notice   but if your wife hasn't picked up on the fact that her husband has changed color  she's just not paying attention   by the way  do you consume just a ridiculous amount of carrots and mega dose vitamins   the carrots turn you yellow  the niacin turns you red   get some finger paints and do the math   and get a good lawyer   deep breath   it's cold   has he been using his inhaler   not in the past few days  he's  um  only ten   i worry about children taking such strong medicine so frequently   what happened to your leg   your doctor probably was concerned about the strength of the medicine  too   she probably weighed that danger against the danger of not breathing   oxygen is so important during those prepubescent years  don't you think   ok  i'm gonna assume that no body's ever told you what asthma is   or if they have  you had other things on your mind    mucus production increases  cell lining starts to shed   but the steroids  the steroids     stop the inflammation   the more often this happens     what   the more often this happens     what   forget it  if you don't trust steroids  you shouldn't trust doctors   my mother passed away three years ago    she had a heart attack  and my father broke his back doing construction   it's house  it's urgent  i'm sorry   you couldn't have knocked   steroids  give her steroids  high doses of prednisone   you're looking for support for a diagnosis of cerebral vasculitus   inflammation of the blood vessels in the brain is awfully rare  especially for someone her age   so is a tumor  her sed rate was elevated   mildly   that could mean anything  or nothing   yeah  i know  i have no reason to think that it's vasculitus except that it could be   if the blood vessels were inflamed that's gonna look exactly like what we saw on the mri from trenton county  and the pressure's gonna cause neurological symptoms   you can't diagnose that without a biopsy   yes  we can  we treat it   if she gets better we know that we're right   and if we're wrong   we learn something else   why steroids   it's part of your treatment   you haven't had many visitors  no boyfriend   three dates  i wouldn't have stood by him if you were vomiting all day   well  what abut work  you must have friends from work   pretty much everybody i like is 5 years old   a nurse said you're stopping my radiation   we're just trying some alternative medications  so  where's your family from then   steroids aren't an alternative to radiation   the tests weren't really conclusive   we're treating you for vasculitus   it's the inflammation of blood vessels in the brain   it's not a tumor  i don't have a tumor   you should have told her the truth  it's a long shot guess   thank you   if house is right  no harm  if he's wrong we've given a dieing woman a couple days hope   false hope   if there was any other type available i would have given her that   why are you smelling billy's pants   i'm not   looked like you were   i was smelling the floor   oh   do you have any pets in this class   no  but we used to have a gerbil  but carly l  dropped a book on it   careless   do you need to smell it   no  i'm smelling for mold   i don't need to smell it   you can smell our parrot   you said you didn't have any pets in this class   a parrot is a bird   parrots are the primary source of psitticosis   it's not the parrot   psitticosis can lead to nerve problems and neurological complications   how many kids were there in the class    20   how many are home sick   none  but     none  but you think that 5 year olds are more serious about bird hygiene than their teacher   you've been through her home   she lives in trenton  i can go up to her room tomorrow morning and ask her for the key   would the police call for permission before dropping by to check out a crime scene   it's not a crime scene   far as i know she's running a meth lab out of her basement   she's a kindergarten teacher   and if i was a kindergarten student i would trust her implicitly    ok  i'll give you a for instance    the lady back there  who made your egg salad sandwich   her eyes look glassy  did you notice that   now hospital policy is to stay home if you're sick   but if you're making  8 00 an hour  then ya kinda need the  8 00 an hour right   the sign in the bathroom says that employees must wash after using the facilities   but i figure that somebody who wipes snot on a sleeve isn't hyper concerned about sanitary conditions   so what do ya think  should i trust her   i want you to check the patient's home for contaminants  garbage  medication     whoa  oh  i can't just break into someone's house   isn't that how you got into the felker's home   yeah  i know  court records are sealed  you were 16  it was a stupid mistake   but your old gym teacher has a big mouth   you should write a thank you note   i should thank him   well  i needed somebody around here with street smarts   ok  knows when you're being conned  knows how to con   i should sue you   i'm pretty sure you can't sue somebody for wrongful hiring   but i'm pretty sure i can sue if you fire me for not breaking into some lady's house   i'm doing research  people are fascinating aren't they   why are you giving adler steroids   well  she's my patient that's what you do with patients  you give them medicine   you don't prescribe medicine based on guesses   at least we don't since tuskeegee and mengele   you're comparing me to a nazi  nice   i'm stopping the treatment   she's my patient   it's my hospital   i did not get her sick  she is not an experiment  i have a legitimate theory about what's wrong with her   with no proof   there's never any proof  5 different doctors come up with 5 different diagnoses based on the same evidence   you don't have any evidence   and nobody knows anything huh  then how is it that you always assume you're right   i don't  i just find it hard to operate on the opposite assumption   and why are you so afraid of making a mistake   because i'm a doctor   because when we make mistakes people die   come on   people used to have more respect for cripples you know   they didn't really   so  how ya feeling   much better  thanks   are you dr  house    i thought he was a he  but      no   don't eat too much too fast   thank him for me   right   should i discontinue the treatment  boss   you got lucky   cool  huh   ok  once again   good   am i ever gonna meet dr  house   well  you might run into him at the movies or on the bus   is he a good man   he's a good doctor   can you be one without the other   don't you have to care about people   caring's a good motivator   he's found something else     feel this    umhmm    how about this    umhmm  ok squeeze   harder   all right   he's your friend  huh   yeah  does he care about you   i think so   you don't know   as dr  house likes to say   everybody lies    it's not what people say  it's what they do   yes  he cares about me   i can't see  i can't see   a little help in here   your chest will be sore for a while   we needed to shock you to get your heart going   ok  can you arrange these to tell a story   she couldn't put them in order   could the damage have been caused by a lack of oxygen during her seizure   no  i gave her the same test 5 minutes later and she did just fine   the altered mental status is intermittent  just like the verbal skills   so  what now   given the latest symptoms it's clearly growing deeper into the brain stem   soon she won't be able to walk  she'll go blind permanently   and then the respiratory center will fail   how long do we have   if it's a tumor we're talking a month  maybe two   if it's infectious a few weeks   if it's vascular that'll probably be fastest of all   maybe a week   we're gonna stop all treatment   i still think it's a tumor  i think we should go back to the radiation   she didn't respond to the radiation   well  maybe we didn't see the effects until we started steroids   no  it's not a tumor  the steroids did something   i just don't know what   so we're just gonna do nothing  we're just gonna watch her die   yeah  we're gonna watch her die   specifically we're gonna watch how fast she's dieing   you just told us  each diagnosis has its own timeframe  when we see how fast it's killing her we'll know what it is   and by then maybe there's nothing we can do about it   there's go to be something we can do  something better then watching her die   well  i got nothing  how about you   bastard  oh  cameron  i need you for a couple of hours   what's up   when you break into someone's house  it's always better to have a white chick with you   adler's house  why don't we just ask her for a key   for all we know she could be running a meth lab out of her basement   i'm tired a lot   any other reason you think you may have chronic fatigue syndrome   it's kinda the definition isn't it   it's kinda the definition of getting older   i had a couple headaches last month   mild fever  sometimes i can't sleep  and i have trouble concentrating   apparently not while researching this stuff on the internet   i was thinking it also might be fibromyalgia   excellent diagnosis   is there anything for that   ya know  i think there might just be   i need 36 vicodin  and change for a dollar   exam room 2   house doesn't believe in pretense   figures life's too short and too painful   so he just says what he thinks   nothing interesting in the garbage    i say what i think  is just another way of saying  i'm an ass    well  if you wanted to be judged on your medical prowess only  maybe you shouldn't have broken into someone's home   i was 16   don't know about ticks  but her dog's definitely got fleas   i managed to make it to 17 without a criminal record   yeah  well you obviously didn't grow up in my neighborhood   that's right  you stole a loaf of bread to feed your starving family right   you always eat during break ins   am i supposed to respect their food more than i respect their dvd players   you want some   no   you gonna go hungry until she dies   no   you know what  after centuries of slavary   decades of civil rights marches  and more significantly living like a monk   never getting less then a 4 0 gpa   you don't think it's kind of disgusting i get one of the top jobs in the country because i'm a delinquent   we'll eat  then we'll tear up the carpet   you went to hopkins right   yep   so  you went to a better school then i did  got better grades then i did   so how'd you get the job   did you stab a guy in a bar fight   nothing   it's not a tumor    she's getting worse too fast   she can't stand up   no toxins  no medication   nothing that would explain these symptoms   family history of neurological problems   not that i could tell from her underwear drawer   you said nothing that would explain these symptoms   what did you find that doesn't explain these symptoms   dr  wilson convinced you to treat this patient under false pretenses   adler's not his cousin   that's ridiculous  you can ask her yourself  can we get back to     she's not jewish   rachel adler's not jewish   i had ham at her apartment   dr  foreman  a lot of jews have non jewish relatives  and most of us don't keep kosher   i can see getting through high school without learning a thing about jews  but medical school     ok  maybe she's jewish  but she's definitely not your cousin   really  this guy's     he  you don't even know her name   you called her rachel  her name is rebecca   yes  yes  her name is rebecca   i call her rachel   you idiot   hey    listen     not you  him  you said you didn't find anything   everything i found was in  you found ham   so   where there's ham there's pork  where there's pork there's neurocysticercosis   tapeworm    you think she's got a worm in her brain   it fits  could have been living there for years  it never occurred to me  millions of people eat ham every day  it's quite a leap to think that she's got a tapeworm   ok  mr  neurologist   what happens when you give steroids to a person who has a tapeworm   they  they get a little better and then they get worse   just like rebecca adler did   in a typical case if you don't cook pork well enough you ingest live tapeworm larvae   they got these little hooks they grab onto your bowel  they live  they grow up  they reproduce   reproduce   there's only got one lesion  and it's nowhere near her bowel   that's because this is not a typical case   tapeworm can produce 20 to 30 000 eggs a day   guess where they go   out   not all of them  unlike the larvae   the egg can pass right through the walls of the intestines  and into the blood stream   and where does the blood stream go   everywhere   as long as it's healthy the immune system doesn't even know it's there   the worm builds a wall  uses secretions to shut down the body's immune response and control fluid flow    it's really kinda beautiful   as long as it's healthy  so what do we do   call a vet and nurse the little guy back to health   it's too late for that   it's dying  and as it dies this parasite loses the ability to control of the host's defenses   the immune system wakes up and attacks the worm  and everything starts to swell  and that is very bad for the brain   it could still be a hundred other things   the eosinophil count was normal   it's only abnormal in 30  of cases   proving nothing   no  no  no  no  you see  it fits  it's perfect  it explains everything   but it proves nothing   i can prove it by treating it   no  you can't    i was just with her  she doesn't want any more treatments   she doesn't want any more experiments   she wants to go home and die   will you excuse us  please   i'm dr  house   it's good to meet you   you're being an idiot  ahem   you have a tapeworm in your brain    it's not pleasant  but if we don't do anything you'll be dead by the weekend   have you actually seen the worm   when you're all better i'll show you my diplomas   you were sure i had vasculitus too   now i can't walk and i'm wearing a diaper   what's this treatment gonna do for me   i'm not talking about a treatment  i'm talking about a cure   but because i might be wrong  you want to die   what made you a cripple   i had an infarction   a heart attack   it's what happens when the blood flow is obstructed   if it's in the heart it's a heart attack  if it's in the lungs it's a pulmonary embolism   if it's in the brain it's a stroke  i had it in my thigh muscles   wasn't there something they could do   there was plenty they could do  if they made the right diagnosis   but the only symptom was pain   not may people get to experience muscle death   did you think you were dying   i hoped i was dying   so you hide in your office  refuse to see patients because you don't like the way people look at you   you feel cheated by life so now you're gonna get even with the world   you want me to fight this   why   what makes you think i'm so much better then you   when you're scared  you'll turn into me   i just want to die with a little dignity   there's no such thing    our bodies break down  sometimes when we're 90  sometimes before we're even born   but it always happens and there's never any dignity in it   i don't care if you can walk  see  wipe your own ass  it's always ugly  always   you can live with dignity  we can't die with it   no treatment   maybe we can get a court order   override her wishes  claim she doesn't have the capacity to make this decision   but she does   but we could claim that the illness made her mentally incompetent  right   pretty common result   that didn't happen here   he's not gonna do it   she's not just a file to him anymore   he respects her   so because you respect her  you're going to let her die   i solved the case  my work is done   patients always want proof   we're not making cars here  we don't give guarantees   i think we can prove it's a worm   it's noninvasive  it's safe   i'm not completely sure but     yeah  yeah  yeah what's the damn idea   have you ever seen a worm under an x ray   a regular old no contrast 100 year old technology x ray   they light up like shotgun pellets  just like on a contrast mri   which is the same thing as a ct scan  which we did  which proved nothing   worm cysts is the same density as the cerebrospinal fluid  we're not going to see anything in her head   but chase is right  he's right  we should x ray her  but we don't x ray her brain  we x ray her leg   worms love thigh muscle   if she's got one in her head i guarantee you there's one in her leg   hold still  rebecca   this here is a worm larva   so  if it's in my leg  it's in my brain   are you looking for a guarantee   it's there  probably been there 6 to 10 years   could i have more   probably  it's good news   what do we do now   now we get you better   albendazole   two pills   yeah  every day for at least a month with a meal   two pills   yeah  possible side effects include abdominal pain  nausea  headache  dizziness  fever  and hair loss   we'll probably make you keep taking the pills even if you get every one of those   why did you hire me   does it matter   kinda hard to work for a guy who doesn't respect you   why   is that rhetorical   no  it just seems that way because you can't think of an answer   does it make a difference why i think i'm a jerk   the only thing that matters is what you think   can you do the job   you hired a black guy because he had a juvenile record   no  it wasn't a racial thing  i didn't see a black guy   i just saw a doctor with a juvenile record   i hired chase 'cause his dad made a phone call   i hired you because you are extremely pretty   you hired me to get into my pants    i can't believe that that would shock you   it's also not what i said  no  i hired you because you look good   it's like having a nice piece of art in the lobby   i was in the top of my class   but not the top   i did an internship at the mayo clinic   yes  you were a very good applicant   but not the best   would that upset you  really   to think that you were hired because of some genetic gift of beauty not some genetic gift of intelligence   i worked very hard to get where i am   but you didn't have to   people choose the paths that grant them the greatest rewards for the least amount of effort  that's the law of nature   and you defied it  that's why i hired you   you could have married rich  could have been a model  you could have just show up and people would have given you stuff    lots of stuff  but you didn't  you worked your stunning little ass off   am i supposed to be flattered   gorgeous women do not go to medical school   unless they're as damaged as they are beautiful   were you abused by a family member   no   sexually assaulted   no   but you are damaged  aren't you   i have to go   i followed her   i couldn't stop thinking about what that doctor said   i told you not to listen to him  he's an idiot   i was orange   i don't want to know what you found out   you don't care   i'm your doctor   you've been good to me and good to this hospital  of course i care   but i don't see how this conversation can end well for me   either your wife is having an affair  or she's not having an affair  and you have come here because you rightly think i should fire him   but i can't even if it cost me your money   the son of a bitch is the best doctor we have   feeling any better   i can't complain   as you know the hospital has certain rules  and as you also know we tend to ignore them   but i think this one's gonna be a little obvious unless we get your help   if anyone asks  you have 11 daughters and 5 sons   hi  you guys   hi   look who's here   it's so good to see you guys  i missed you   is this for me  it's beautiful   oh  i love you guys   i wanted to thank dr  house  but he never visited again   he cured you  you didn't cure him   ok  i want a hug and a kiss from every single one of you  get up here right now   there   hold on   she's converted   you said she was your cousin   why would you lie   it got you to take the case   you lied to a friend to save a stranger  you don't think that's screwed up   you've never lied to me   i never lie   oh  really   why do we do this   because we're doctors  when we make mistakes people die   dr  house  you have a patient   he says he needs a refill   got change for a dollar     no  you can't always get what you want    you can't always get what you want
