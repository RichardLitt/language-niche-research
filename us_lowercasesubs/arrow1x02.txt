   1 the day i went missing     was the day i died   five years in hell forged me into a weapon   which i use to honor a vow i made to my father   who sacrificed his life for mine   in his final moments  he told me the truth     that our family's wealth had been   that he failed our city   and that it was up to me to save it and right his wrongs   but to do that without endangering the people closest to me   i have to be someone else   i have to be something else   who's that  where'd he come from   what's going on here   get the chopper back now   who's is guy   whoa  whoa  easy  wait  wait   no  please    marcus redman   you failed this city   please  don't  please  don't   cell phone  inside pocket  call your partner   tell him to give those pensioners back their money   do it now   okay   over the past 15 years   mr  redman has withdrawn more than   30 million from the plan's account   mr  redman claims refunding the halcyon pension plan  has always been his intent   but sources say redman was coerced by the vigilante   this guy gets more air time than the kardashians  right   five years on an island and you still know who they are   i've been catching up   it's nice to see how much our culture has improved while i was away   but the city used to be different  people used to feel safe   aw  what's the matter  mom  afraid we're gonna be next   do you have any questions about today  oliver   it's a simple proof of life declaration   just read out a brief  prepared statement to the judge   and then your death in absentia judgment will be voided   it's fine  walter  i've been in a courtroom before   four times by my estimate   you know  there was the dui   the assault on that paparazzi douchebag   stealing that taxi  which was just awesome  by the way   and who could forget peeing on the cop   i wish everyone would   i'd hang  but we're headed to court   i know  that's why i'm here   my best friend is getting legally resurrected   i wouldn't miss this for the world  right  okay   what about you   oh  i think the first four times of you in court was enough for me   fair enough   mrs  queen  car's ready   walter   are you going to testify as to what happened when the yacht sank   are you going to talk about the boat crash   mr  queen  did you see sarah lance die   sarah   there was a storm   the boat went down  i was the only survivor   she's not there  sarah   my father didn't make it   no   i almost died  i     i thought that i had  because i spent so many days  on that life raft before i saw land   when i reached it  i knew     i knew that i was gonna have to live for both of us   and in those five years   it was that one thought that kept me going   your honor  we move to vitiate the death in absentia  filed after oliver's disappearance at sea  aboard the queen's gamut five years ago   unfortunately we will not be requesting  that the declaration of death filed for the petitioner's father   robert queen  be rescinded   the queen family is only entitled to one miracle  i'm afraid   now  onto the offices  everyone is waiting to meet you there   uh  mom  that was        a little bit heavier than i was expecting it to be   can we do that tomorrow  please   of course  thank you   last week  you couldn't wait to get to the company   tommy  i'd just spent five years away from civilization   i wasn't exactly thinking straight   i    hi   what are you doing here   oh  they were bringing me back from the dead   legally speaking   what are you doing here  my job   right  more like the d a 's   hi  oliver queen  emily nocenti   oliver just got back from five years on an uncharted island   before that he was cheating on me with my sister   he was with her when she died   and last week  he told me to stay away from him   it was really good advice   excuse me   it was nice to meet you  yeah  let's go   come on  buddy  shake it off  let's go   mr  somers  mr  somers   what do you have to say about the accusations made by laurel lance   i don't know what i've done to earn this witch hunt  from miss lance and her bosses at the cnri   but i can tell you this   i am an honest businessman  and i will fight this slander  to my last dime and breath   that's all i have to say  thank you   oh  there's mr  queen     mr  queen  do you want to follow up  what happened in there  sir   tell us what happened inside  mr  queen     step back everybody  please   can you give us a couple comments  about the island  mr  queen  before you go  sir  please   couple of comments about the island  sir  what happened in there   everybody  step back   hey man  i'll make you swallow that nikon  back   this happens to you a lot  doesn't it   how much is a life worth   a life of a man  a good man   a stevedore on the docks of the city in which we live   a father   a man with a daughter   the plaintiff will prove by a preponderance of evidence  that victor nocenti learned that his boss   that man sitting right there  martin somers   was taking bribes from the chinese triads  to smuggle drugs into our city   and when victor nocenti threatened to tell the police   martin somers had him killed   mr  somers is very well connected   and has friends in the district attorney's office   which is why  if emily nocenti  is to get justice for her father's death   if martin somers is to get justice for his crimes   then someone is going to have to do it for them    martin somers   laurel's targeted the worst of starling city   so it's no surprise his name is on my father's list   the city's police and the d a  can't stop him     or won't   laurel thinks she's the only one willing to bring him to justice   she's wrong   you  listen up   the longer this goes on  the more likely the media is gonna crucify me   you shut this trial down  do you understand me   what the hell   martin somers    who the hell are you      you've failed this city   no  no  no  no  no  no   you're gonna testify in that trial   you're gonna confess to having victor nocenti killed   there won't be a second warning       arrow 1x02     honor thy father original air date on october 17  2012     sync  corrected by elderman     i hired you to protect my son   now  i'm not a professional bodyguard   but it seems to me that the first requirement would be managing to stay  next to the man you're hired to protect   with all due respect  ma'am  i never had a client who didn't want my protection   i hired you  that makes me the client   now where do you think my son is going on these chaperone less excursions   ma'am  i truly do not know   and he truly doesn't   then perhaps you'd like to share with me  you know  where it is you run off to   i've been alone for five years   i know that  oliver  mom     alone   i see   i promise to introduce her if it ever gets  to the exchanging first names stage     no  i'd rather you promise to take mr  diggle with you on your next rendezvous   it's not safe  you've already been abducted once   there is a maniac out there  hunting the wealthy   that maniac saved my life   this isn't a game   i lost you once   and i am not going through that again   okay   digg's my guy   thank you   sorry to give you so much grief   i served three tours in afghanistan  mr  queen   you don't even come close to my definition of grief   but i tell you what     you ditch me one more time   no one will have to fire me   where you going   uh    somewhere loud and smoky   and don't bother trying to pickpocket my stash this time   because i'm gonna go get drunk instead   thea   do you think this is what dad would want for you   dead people don't want anything   it's one of the benefits of being dead   i was dead   and i wanted a lot   except for your family   you've been home a week and all you do  is avoid mom  ignore walter  and judge me   don't wait up   well  i owe you an apology  mr  somers   we come all the way down to your docks   and it turns out  you don't need the police after all   which is exactly what i've been saying   yeah  so i guess that 9 1 1 call we got last night  from your stevedore  saying that you were getting attacked  by a guy in a green hood and a bow and arrow     i guess    well  was that a practical joke   these guys like to fool around   yeah   well  you know  i'd be very much inclined  to believe an honest  upstanding businessman like yourself   except  well  one of my men  found this at your docks   you see  there's this vigilante running around   he thinks he's some kind of robin hood   he's robbing the rich  he's trying to teach them a lesson i guess   i don't know  i don't know  but the point is   the man's a killer   and nothing  and no one  is going to stop me from bringing him down   but like you said     hmm      clearly  nothing happened here last night   isn't this a conflict of interest  detective   after all  your daughter is suing me   i'm pretty good at keeping my emotions in check   i'm not   you and your daughter don't want to find out what i'm capable of  when i get emotional   as you can see  oliver  we've modernized quite a bit   hi   are you enjoying yourself  yes  i am   i remember when your father used to bring you here when you were a boy   you always were so excited   dad let me drink soda in the office   ah  so that's why you enjoyed coming   the queen consolidated's success of late  is a result of its targeted diversification   we have been making impressive inroads in cutting edge fields  like bio tech and clean energy   that's neat  excuse me   can i get a sparkling water  or something cold  please   sweetheart  oliver   walter and i have something to discuss with you   come  please sit   mom  it makes me nervous when you ask me to sit down   the company's about to break ground on a new site  for the applied sciences division   and we would like to honor your father  by dedicating the building in his name  nice   and we'd like to make an announcement at the dedication  that you will be taking a leadership position in the company   no  no  your    your company   no  i don't want to lead anything   besides  walter is doing a very good job here   you said that you wanted to be a different person   and you are robert queen's son   i don't need to be reminded of that   well  obviously you do   everyone here understands that this transition is really difficult for you   thank you  walter   which part  though   everyone fantasizing that i got my mba while i was on the island   or the fact that my father's cfo now sleeps down the hall from me   you know  five years ago  your irresponsibility was somewhat charming   it is a lot less so now   there he is   the driver will be here in a minute   okay   you know  i spent the first 27 years of my life in starling city   and the next five in afghanistan   you want to know what i learned   there's no place like home   no  just the opposite   home is a battlefield   back home  they're all trying to get you   get you to open up  be somebody you're not sure you are anymore   or i could be wrong   maybe after five years alone   you're not as messed up in the head as you have every right to be   hey   hey  get away   hey   dad   hey  hey  stay away from him   well  we anticipate that somers' attorney  will try and paint you as blinded by grief or looking to make a buck   this isn't about the money   i just want justice for my father   emily  there are a lot of people who don't want this trial to proceed   dangerous people   my mother died when i was a baby   and my father has been the only family i've ever known  and they slit his throat   they are going to have to kill me  if they want me to give this up   well let's hope it doesn't come to that   and it won't   what's going on   what's going on is that the three of you  are getting around the clock police protection  okay   get used to their faces   because they're going with you everywhere you go  no arguments   i'm a lawyer  i live to argue   i'm your father  i live to keep you safe   um  emily  let's go grab a cup of coffee  okay   yes  why not do that  thank you  please  go with them   stay there   protective custody   i seem to recall you trying that once i discovered boys also   didn't work then either   this isn't a joke  laurel   martin somers got attacked last night   what  yeah   by who  it doesn't matter   point is  you have whipped up a storm with these guys   and until the dust settles you'll be protected  okay   end of discussion   that might have worked when i was eight   but it's not gonna work anymore   end of discussion  laurel   you're insistent on doing your job  that's great   but this is me doing mine  okay   and not just as a father  but as a cop   these people  they are more dangerous than you are willing to admit   and you've made them angry   thank you for coming  anything for a friend   we're not friends   you smuggle drugs  i let you use my port   for which you're paid a lot of money   i don't get paid enough to have arrows shot at me   you need to take this guy seriously   he is a bigger threat to your operation than nocenti ever was   except now it's nocenti's daughter who's the problem   unlike your friend with the hood  we know where to find her   don't be an idiot   you take out emily nocenti  and laurel lance will never let this go   she won't stop until she burns you   me  and then the entire triad to the ground   then we kill miss lance   attorney for shipping magnate  martin somers   has confirmed his client has no intention of testifying   maintaining his innocence in the wrongful death of victor nocenti   nocenti's body was found four weeks ago   we'll keep you updated as more information becomes available   wait  how did you get those   don't you knock   no  wait    mom said that there were scars  but     i'm    oliver  what happened to you out there   i don't want to talk about it   of course you don't   you never want to talk to me about anything   except for my social life  wait   where are you going   why should i tell you   i'm sorry  thea   i need to get better at talking about what happened to me there   but i'm not ready yet   okay   do you have a second   yeah   good   i wanna show you something out back   sometimes  when i felt    whatever     i'd come here   about a month after the funerals  mom stopped going out   pretty soon  she stopped talking altogether   the house got so quiet  so i'd come here   to talk to you   i mean  stupid stuff   like what i was doing that day  what boy i had a crush on     and then sometimes  i'd ask you   beg you  to find your way home to me   now  here you are   and the truth is  i felt closer to you when you were dead   look  i know it was hell where you were   but it was hell here too   you gotta let me in  ollie   you gotta let someone in   hi   are you okay   there are two cop cars outside   how am i supposed to stay away from you  if you won't stay away from me   i    what are you doing here  ollie   my sister took     she pointed out to me that i have been distant since i got back and that     it would probably be a good idea if i let somebody in   so  you thought you'd start with the first person you pushed away   i did that to protect you   and then i saw you yesterday   and i realized that i hurt you   thank you   wow   this place hasn't changed in five years   i haven't really had time to redecorate   i'm a jerk   before the island  i was a jerk  and now i'm just a     i'm a damaged jerk   what's in the bag   i thought about many things on the island   but there was one thing that i thought about every day   i actually dreamed about it   and i promised myself that if i ever got a chance  to do it again  i'd do it with you   eat ice cream   this is as good as i remember   my mother wants me to join the company   yeah  take my rightful place   i can't exactly picture you as master of the universe   you know  after five years   i have plans   i have things that i have to do   i can't do that if i'm     i don't know     attending board meetings and stockholder briefings   oliver  hmm   you're an adult   you can say no   oh  i tried   didn't take   well  then don't tell her   show her   be the person that you want her to see you as   trust me   i have plenty of experience with disapproving parents   i have been on the receiving end of your father's disapproval   he blames himself more than he blames you   he thinks that  you know  maybe if he and sarah were closer   she would have told him about the boat trip   and he could have stopped her from going with you   i am sorry   you apologized already   and it'll never be enough   did you hear that   what   there's someone on the fire escape   hey  come on   what are     are you hurt  no   are you hurt  mr  queen  no  no   this is why it's a good idea to have a bodyguard   you okay   daddy  oh  thank god   thank god  are you all right  i'm okay   those cops that you put on me     they     i went outside to ask for a light and they were both dead in the squad car   mr  diggle  thank you   feel free to run as many red lights in the city as you want   i was just doing my job  sir   no  your job is protecting him   it seems like whenever you're with one of my daughters  people die   you stay away from laurel   or i swear the next time you disappear   it will be permanent  dad   no  laurel    it's okay   i understand   yeah   here   i'd say thank you  but i don't think that would cover it   well  like i told your cop friend  i was just doing my job   besides  i think it should be you that i'm thanking   what for  the knife   the knife   i got lucky  that was a kitchen knife   it wasn't even weighted properly   yet you threw it with accuracy across a 10 foot room   exactly  i got lucky   i'm not the kind of man you want to take for a fool  mr  queen  you understand me   yes   and i think i'm just beginning to understand the kind of man you are   shouldn't take you very long   i'm shallow   and very tired  so     good night   good night  sir   it wasn't how i wanted things to go   i wanted to give martin somers the chance to confess  and face a court's justice   but he chose to go after someone i care about instead   he's still going to face justice   it'll just be a different kind   everyone wants to know what kind of man i am   martin somers is about to find out   triad bitch screwed up the hit on lance   now  the triad is gonna erase every ounce  of evidence of their smuggling operation  including me   except that's not gonna happen   tell wallace to get the boat ready  i'm leaving tonight   wallace   wallace  you copy   wallace   wallace isn't here   but i am   we need to move  now   move  sir  we've got six men out there   it's not enough  move it   you're gonna go back into that courtroom tomorrow  and you're gonna recuse yourself from this case  all right   or drop it  either way  you're done   if you think i'm gonna abandon emily nocenti   then you don't know me all that well   you don't know me well  young lady   i will lock you in a cell if that's what it takes   well  i guess that's what it's gonna take then   damn it  laurel   i thought after what happened with sarah   you'd stop being just so reckless   it's not about being reckless   it's just the opposite   i'm trying to make this city safer  just like you   sweetie   you're my only daughter  laurel   you're all i have left to live for   but what you want from me isn't living   having cops around  not being able to do my job   your job is not going after people like the triad or somers   my job is to use the law to fight for what is right   just like you taught me   well  that's dirty  using me against me   you can't do that   well     maybe i picked that up along the way  too   lance   i'll be right there   i gotta go   something's going on at the docks   somers   oh  god  no  no  no   he can't help you   i want the truth about victor nocenti   i can't   the triad will kill me   the triad's not your concern right now   all right  all right  all right   it wasn't me that killed him  it was the triad   acting on whose instructions   whose   all right  all right  it was mine  it was mine  all right   nocenti said he was gonna testify against me   put down your weapons  or we will open fire   i repeat  lay down your weapons   freeze   you twitch and you're dead   bow down  hands up   all right  all right  it was mine  it was mine  all right   nocenti said he was gonna testify against me   you son of a bitch   laurel will be safe   she was right   i can't be the oliver my mother wants me to be  and still keep the promise i made to my father   i have to be the person i need them to see me as   oh  excuse me  ladies   okay  this is a surprise   did you show up here by mistake   by invitation   oliver invited me last night  last night   is that surprise or jealousy i'm hearing   look  i just don't want him to find out anything  okay   oliver has been through a lot   tommy  we've all been through a lot   good afternoon   and thank you all for coming   welcome to the future site of the robert queen memorial applied sciences center   now  this is a building that will stand as a monument  to the man whose company and vision are his greatest legacies   whoa  whoa   what about me  right  i'm a legacy   hey  thanks for warming them up  walt   all right  ow  fine  fine shovel  i got it     whoa  ow    he must be drunk   i got it  i got it   some of you may not know me  my name is oliver queen   watch some television  read a newspaper   i'm kind of famous right now   mostly  though  i'm famous because i'm robert queen's son   uh  but as walter  who's my new dad     huh  who is    sorry   as walter was saying   i'm not much of a legacy  per se   oliver  you don't have to do this   no  sit  sit   gosh   see  i was supposed to come here today   and i'm supposed to take my rightful place at the company   prodigal son returns home and becomes the heir apparent   but i'm not my father   i'm not the man he was   i'm not half the man he was   i never will be   so  please  stop asking me to be   martin somers  the ceo of starling port   was arrested last night for the murder of victor nocenti   he is also being accused of accepting cash  including over  10 million in bribes   well  we can pursue the civil suit if you want   but the d a  now has no choice   with mr  somers' confession  to prosecute him   he's going to jail  emily   for the rest of his life   thank you so much for fighting for us   well  thank you for being brave enough to let me   hey   i thought i didn't need police protection anymore   i thought i didn't need a reason to see my own daughter   you don't   hmm  you look tired   yeah  i was filling out reports on the shootout at the port last night  and getting grilled about how i let that archer get away   i have to admit  i'm kind of glad he did   he brought down martin somers   he hurt a bunch of people doing it  okay   he is no hero  he is an anarchist   yeah  well  whoever he is   it seems like he's trying to help   the city doesn't need that kind of help  okay   it's like i always told you  you don't need to go  outside the law to find justice  now i believe that   all right  and i promise you  when i catch this guy   he's gonna believe it  too   well  you saw for yourself   my son knows nothing   robert didn't tell him anything that could hurt us   and he has no idea that the yacht was sabotaged   all that time on the island  plotting my return   i didn't realize how hard it would be   to reconnect with mom  thea   laurel  okay  i didn't     i didn't know how painful it would be to keep my secrets   you asked me to save the city   to right your wrongs   i will   i swear   but to do that   i can't be the oliver that everyone wants me to be   which means that sometimes     to honor your wishes     i need to dishonor your memory   i'm sorry   take it down   will you be going out tonight  sir   definitely   no  no        sync  corrected by elderman
