you told everyone  eric's just visiting grandpa in rhode island your aunt carol in miami   so you're actually hiding him he tries to take his own life    and you're worried it's gonna cost you  mom of the year    serena  you've been gone   doing who knows what with god knows who    i told you  boarding school was not like that then you know what   as happy as i am to have you home   you have no idea what it's been like   guess whose dad is cool   it's a trick question yeah  'cause it can't be ours   ha ha  ha ha  look at this    top ten forgotten bands of the '90s    yeah  check out who's

number nine   hey what are you working on it's called  everyone's going   you were invited to that   well  no offense if i sound surprised  since i've never been invited one of the girls in my art class saw my calligraphy   and she said that if i addressed all the invitations  that i could have one sounds very fair  the sweatshops could learn a thing or two   dad  this is not a platform  for one of your anticapitalist rants yes  it is   besides  you make us go to private school that's for your education   so we should just be anonymous losers who eat lunch alone   and never get invited to parties   works for me   mom thinks it's a good idea and her judgment is always sound  right   jenny  you wanna go to that party  you should go   you kids could use some fun   nate   oh  hey   uh  your mom told me  you guys were staying here at the palace   yeah  uh we're renovating again   you know my mom  if it's not broke  break it   so what are you doing here   oh  i just wanted to see how

friend and you're her boyfriend   and she loves you   that's the way things are supposed to be   hey watch where yore gng   serena looked effing hot last night   there's something wrong with that level of perfection   it needs to be violated   you're telling me if you had the chance  i have a girlfriend   you guys have been dating since kindergarten  and you haven't sealed the deal   who says   seal the deal    come on   are you following us or something   no  i i go to your school   identical uniforms is that kind of a tip off   that's funny   so you guys wanna sit together at lunch   so cute  these should be framed or something   not bad work   and here's yours  as promised   thanks   hey   here you guys are   i looked all over the dining hall for you   oh  hi  i'm serena   i know i mean  hi  i'm jenny   hi   so     when's the party   saturday   and   you're kinda not invited     since until 12 hours ago   everyone thought you were at boarding school   now we're full  and  uh jenny used up all the invites   um  actually  you can go now   sorry   no  that's okay   i got a lot of stuff to do anyway   well we should get going then   unless you want us to wait for you   looks

friend   did b  think s would go down without a fight   or can these two hotties work it out   there's nothing gossip gir  than a good catfight   and this could be a classic   uh  you know  you know  dad   there's this thing called myspace  n wheryou capost all this information online   save some trees  have a blog   maybe if musicians got off their blogs  and picked up their guitars   the music

spirit   that's one of the reasons i fell for her in the first place   i meant with the fliers   luckily staple guns are old school     sing  na  na  na  na  go  i'm gonna be fine all right     na  na

kiss on the lips party   sort of   speaking of that  um  here   i made you one during free period   but if anyone asks where you got it  i know nothing   thanks   dan  dan   jenny   that dress would look even better in black   black  cool  thanks      all the ladies say hey    this is some good stuff   yeah  i'm gonna need it   blair's mom's at the country house   yeah  well  then maybe i should swipe some of my dad's viagra     or my mom's paxil   nathaniel  you're finally about to have sex  with your girlfriend   it's like you're headed to your execution   no  man  i'm good   talk to chuck  buddy   you and blair have been dating forever    all of a sudden there's a problem   there's no problem   it's just     do you ever feel like  our whole lives have been planned out for us   that we're just gonna end up like our parents   man  that's a dark thought   and aren't we entitled to choose  just to be happy look  easy  socrates   what we're entitled to is a trust fund   maybe a house in the hamptons a prescription drug problem   but happiness does not seem to be on the menu   so smoke up and seal the deal with blair   'cause you're also entitled to tap that ass   so how's your mom doing with the divorce and everything   great   so my dad left her for another man   she lost 15 pounds got an eye lift    it's been good for her   i'm really sorry   yeah  i could tell since you didn't call or write  the entire time it was happening   no  i i know  i was just  boarding school is like  i don't even know why  you went to boarding school to being with   do you know how it felt  calling your house when you didn't show up at school  and having your mom say  serena didn't tell you  that she moved to connecticut    i just   i i had to go  i just    i needed to get away from everything   please  just trust me   how can i trust you when i feel like i don't even know you   let's fix that   i saw you at school with  with katy and is   and i i get it   i i don't want to take any of that away from you    because it's just yours to take if you want it   no  that  that's not what i mean  i     i miss you   i just want things to go back to the way they used to be    you know walking to school together   dancing on tables at bungalow   night swimming at your mom's country house   you were like my sister   you know and with our families     we need each other   well     you missed some classic eleanor waldorf meltdowns   if it wasn't such a tragedy it would've been funny   actually  it kind of was   hmm  well  i wish i could've been there   you are now   i have to meet nate   kinda have something special planned   well  i don't want to keep you  but  um     i love you  b   i love you  too  s   spotted at the palace hotel    s  and b having a heart to heart   hmm  why so thirsty  s    you may have won over b  for now   but we still think you're hiding something   hey   ah the invisible man returns   you know  i really had no idea you could move that fast   yeah  well  uh  your fashion emergency was solved    so i figured my work was done   come on  dan   serena said hi to you at a ninth grade birthday party    and you've never forgotten it   how could i  she was  and i'm pretty sure she thought i was someone else   you know she's actually nice   and if she did know you i think she'd really like you   i don't know  i think she might be a tad overwhelmed  by the glitz and the glamour of the humphrey lifestyle   well  i heard she's living at the palace hotel     well  my  my point exactly   probably sitting at the bar by herself   sipping martinis  all alone   you know it's actually kind of sad   oh  and  um  dad's at the gallery working late   he  uh left money for dinner   so i was thinking indian   you know  you know what i think i'm     i'm gonna go out   ok  good 'cause i already ordered  and only got enough for one   move  please   i love this town   i'm going to have to tell my parents  the hotel they just bought is serving minors   and if you get a drink they're also serving pigs    i love it when you talk dirty   you just love  actually  i prefer them when they're not talking   mm  i've missed your witty banter   let's catch up  take our clothes off  stare at each other   how about i just get a bite to eat   i've been drinking on an empty stomach   i heard you didn't do that anymore   special occasion   oh   well  how about

to be special   what's wrong   look i don't know how to say this     or if it's even the right thing to do   but um     there's something i need to tell you   alfonso you're a stud   now uh have a good night  we're closing the kitchen early   oh my god  this is so good   well if you're looking for a way to thank me   i've got a couple ideas   it's a sandwich chuck    this is    mnh mnh   this
