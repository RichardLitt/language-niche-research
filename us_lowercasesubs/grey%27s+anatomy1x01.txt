your competition   eight of you will switch to an easier specialty   five of you will crack under the pressure   two of you will be asked to leave   this is your starting line   this is your arena

list  pagers    nurses will page you   you will answer every page at a run    a run    that's rule number two   your first shift starts now and lasts 48 hours   you're interns  grunts  nobodies  bottom of the surgical food chain   you run labs  write orders  work every second night until you drop  and don't complain   on call rooms    attendings hog them   sleep when you can where you can  which brings me to rule number three   if i'm sleeping  don't wake me unless your patient is actually dying   rule number four    the dying patient better not be dead when i get there   not only will you have killed someone  you would have woke me for no good reason  we clear   yes   you said five rules  that was only four   rule number five    when i move  you move   get out of my way   what do

that explain her seizures     i just thought you wanna know    okay   i heard every year  the attending on call picks the best intern  and lets them perform a procedure during the first shift   i'm just saying it's what i heard   go away    now   yeah  sounds good   he'll be fine   you'll  be fine   if you don't count the fact that my bacon days are over  sure   so  bypass surgery tomorrow with dr  burke    i hear he's good   and  after that  you can have all the bacon flavored soy product you can eat   mmm  kill me now   i wish i could  but i'm a healer   you're lost   i'm not lost   how

was  like  a nurse   you and i are gonna have so much fun together   this shift is a marathon  not a sprint  eat   i can't   you should eat something   you try eating after performing 17 rectal exams  the nazi hates me   the nazi's a resident  i have attendings hating me   you know meredith is inbred   like it's uncommon around here to be a doctors' parents     no  royally inbred    her mother is

katie is stable  and       wait one damn minute   we came here because this hospital is supposed to be the best in washington   that's my kid in there    my kid     and you have the audacity to stand

the machine    i'm done    simple procedure   so i shouldn't worry   i'm very good at what i do   but still it's surgery   there are some risks   i'll see you in the o r  this afternoon  mr  savitch   you're not gonna leave me alone with that guy  are you   oh  i'll be outside the o r  the whole time   no  dr  burke is very good   don't worry   i'll see you after   he'll be fine  right   tony's gonna sail through it   you have nothing to worry about    i promise   i gotta go   what are you doing   i'm suturing a banana with the vain hope that it wakes up my brain   what are you smiling at  007   i'm sorry  i get mean when i'm tired   you know what   i don't care   i comforted a family  and i got to hang out in the o r  today  all is well   does anybody know why we're here   well  good morning   i'm gonna do something pretty rare for a surgeon   i'm gonna ask interns for help   i've got this kid  katie bryce   right now  she's a mystery   she doesn't respond to our meds   the labs are clean  the scans are pure   but she's having seizures    grand mal seizures with no visible cause   she's a ticking clock   she's gonna die if i don't make a diagnosis  which is where you come in   i can't do it alone   i need your extra minds  extra eyes   i need you to play detective  i need you to find out why katie is having seizures   i know you're tired  you're busy  you got more work than you can possibly handle   i understand  so i'm gonna give you an incentive   whoever finds the answer rides with me   katie needs surgery   you get to do what no interns get to do    scrub in to assist on an advanced procedure   dr  bailey's gonna hand you katie's chart   the clock is ticking fast  people   if we're gonna save katie's life  we have to do it soon   look  give the antibiotics time to work   the antibiotics should have worked by now   she's old  she's freaking ancient   she's lucky she's still breathing   i got a shot to scrub in downstairs on a patient that wasn't alive during the civil war   don't page me again   hey  i want in on shepherd's surgery   you've been the intern on katie since the start   you want to work together   if we find the answer  we have a 50 50 chance of scrubbing in   i'll work with you  but i don't want in on the surgery  you can have it   you're kidding  it's the biggest opportunity any intern will ever get   i don't want to spend any more time with shepherd than i have to   what do you have against shepherd   if we find the answer  the surgery's yours  do you want to work together or not   deal   so she doesn't have anoxia  chronic renal failure  or acidosis   it's not a tumor  because her c t 's clean   are you seriously not gonna tell me why you won't work with shepherd   no   what about infection   no  there's no white count  and she has no c t  lesions  no fevers   nothing in her spinal tap  just tell me   you can't comment  make a face  or react in any way   we had sex   what about an aneurysm   no blood on the c t  and no headaches   okay  there's no drug use  no pregnancy  no trauma   was he good   i mean  he looks like he'd be good  was it any good   we're out of answers   what if no one comes up with anything   you mean what if she dies   yeah   this is gonna sound really bad  but i really wanted that surgery   she's just never gonna get the chance to turn into a person   the sum total of her existence will be almost winning miss teen whatever   you know what her pageant talent is   they have talent   rhythmic gymnastics   oh  come on   what is rhythmic gymnastics  i can't even say it  i don't know what it is   i think it's something with a ball and a     what   meredith  what   get up  come on   the only thing that she wouldpossibly need is an angiogram   oh  oh  dr  shepherd  just one moment   katie competes in beauty pageants   i know that  but we have to save her life  anyway   she has no headaches  no neck pain  her c t  is clean     there's no medical proof of an aneurysm     right     but what if she has an aneurysm  anyway    there are no indicators   she twisted her ankle practicing for the pageant     i appreciate you trying to help  but       she fell when she twisted her ankle  she fell   it was no big deal  not even a bump on the head  she got up  iced her ankle  and everything was fine   it was a fall so minor  her doctor didn't even think to mention it when i was taking her history   but she did fall   you know what the chance is that a minor fall could burst an aneurysm   one in a million    literally   let's go   where   to find out if katie's one in a million   i'll be damned   there it is   it's minute  but it's there   it's a subarachnoid hemorrhage   she's bleeding into her brain   she could have gone through her entire life without it ever being a problem     one tap in the right spot       and it exploded   exactly  now i can fix it   you two did great work   love to stay and kiss your asses  but i got to tell katie's parents she's having surgery     katie bryce's chart  please    here you go   dr  shepherd  you'd said that you'd pick someone to scrub in if we helped   oh  yes  right  i'm sorry i can't take you both   it's gonna be a full house   meredith  i'll see you in o r   good  thank you   cristina     wow  that was quick   his heart had too much damage to give him a bypass   i had to let him go   it happens    rarely  but it does happen     the worst part of the game   but i told his wife    i told gloria that he would be fine     i promised her that       you what     they have four little girls     this is my case   did you hear me promise   the only one that can keep a promise like that is god  and i haven't seen him holding a scalpel lately   you never promise a patient's family a good outcome   i thought     you're important enough to make promises to mrs  savitch   you get to be the one to tell her that she's a widow   izzie     maybe meredith couldn't       izzie     i'll tell him i changed my mind    don't do me any favors  it's fine     cristina       you did a cutthroat thing  deal with it   don't come to me for absolution  you want to be a shark  be a shark     i'm not       oh  yes  you are   only it makes you feel all bad in your warm  gooey places   no  screw you   i don't get picked for surgeries 'cause i slept with my boss   and i didn't get into med school 'cause i have a famous mother   some of us have to earn what we get   gloria  there were complications in the surgery   tony's heart had a lot of damage   we tried to take him off bypass  but     there wasn't anything we could have done   what are you talking about   he     tony died   he's dead   gloria     i am so sorry   please     go away   i promised i'd make her look cool   apparently  being a bald beauty queen is the worst thing that happened in the history of the world   did you choose me for the surgery because i slept with you   yes   i'm kidding   i'm not gonna scrub in for surgery   you should ask cristina  she really wants it   you're katie's doctor   and on your first day  with very little training  you helped save her life   you earned the right to follow her case through to the finish   you shouldn't let the fact that we had sex get in the way of you taking your shot   i wish i wanted to be a chef  or a ski instructor or a kindergarten teacher   you know  i would have been a really good postal worker   i'm dependable   you know  my parents tell everyone they meet that their son's a surgeon   as if it's a big accomplishment     superhero or something   if they could see me now   when i told my mother i wanted to go to medical school   she tried to talk me out of it     said i didn't have what it takes to be a surgeon   that i'd never make it   so the way i see it  superhero sounds pretty damn good   we're gonna survive this  right   she's still short of breath  did you get an abg or a chest film   oh  yes  sir  i did   and what did you see   oh  well  i had a lot of patients last night   name the common causes of post op fever     uh  yes    from your head  not from a book   don't look it up  learn it  it should be in your head  name the common causes of post op fever   uh    the common causes of post    can anybody name the common causes of post op fever   wind  water  wound  walking  wonder drugs    the five w's     most of the time  it's wind     splinting or pneumonia   pneumonia's easy to assume  especially if you're too busy to do the tests   what do you think's wrong with 4 b   the fourth  w    walking    i think she's a prime candidate for a pulmonary embolus   how would you diagnose   spiral c t   v q scan  provide o2   dose with heparin  and consult for an ivc filter   do exactly as she says  then tell your resident that i want you off this case   i'd know you anywhere  you're the spitting image of your mother   welcome to the game   all right  everybody  it's a beautiful night to save lives   let's have some fun   i can't think of any one reason why i want to be a surgeon     but i can think of a thousand reasons why i should quit   they make it hard on purpose   there are lives in our hands   there comes a moment when it's more than just a game     and you either take that step forward  or turn around and walk away   i could quit   but here's the thing     i love the playing field     it was good surgery    yeah   we don't have to do that thing where i say something  and then you say something   and then somebody cries  and there's a moment   yuck   good   you should get some sleep   you look like crap   i look better than you   that's not possible   that was amazing   you practice on cadavers     you observe     and you think you know what you're gonna feel like  standing over that table  but     that was such a high   i don't know why anybody does drugs   yeah   yeah   i should  uh  go do this   you should   i'll see you around   see you around   see you   so     i made it through my first shift   we all did   the other interns are all good people  you'd like them     i think   i don't know    maybe   i like them   oh  and i changed my mind   i'm not gonna sell the house   i'm gonna keep it   i'll have to get a couple of roommates  but     it's home  you know   are you the doctor   no   i'm not your doctor   but i am a doctor   what's your name   it's me  mom    meredith   all right   i used to be a doctor  i think   you were a doctor  mom   you were a surgeon   transcript  raceman   synchro  amariss
