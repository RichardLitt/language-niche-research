   1 man  i have been sober for two years  seven months  and 13 days now   i could    give you how many hours in seconds   but then you might think i'm obsessive    i guess i just want to say     thank you   uh  without these meetings   without the support of people like you   i just don't know where i'd be     moderator  thanks  eric   hey   you okay   moderator  all right  we're gonna wrap things up now   uh  tomorrow's meeting     sherlock    amygdala       mm  6 00   excellent   watson  what do you mean  you put yourself in a trance  hypnotize myself   simple  really   the key is word repetition   my word  as you may have guessed   is  amygdala    so you hypnotized yourself  at your first group support meeting   couldn't listen to all those sob stories  now  could i   that's the whole point   and  you know  when you feel comfortable  you can share   you've lived with me a week now  watson   you know i don't share   well  then why can't you listen   attic theory   i've always believed the human brain is like    an attic   a storage space for facts   but because that space is finite   it must be filled only with the things  one needs to be the best version of oneself   it's important  therefore  not to have useless facts   the natterings that comprise a typical support group meeting   for example  crowding out  useful ones   just     can i borrow this   woman  hey  what are you doing  he's nuts   your brain  hm   useful facts   useful  viscous  golden   natterings   that is the stupidest thing i've ever heard   that is not even how the brain works     it's how my brain works   okay  more natterings   i am going to a dinner tonight with a friend   but i will be back before 10 00   so i'll be there at 8 00     two whole hours by my lonesome   aren't you worried i'll go on some sort of binge   well  brief stretches apart  are actually a natur     a natural progression in our companionship   yes  you mentioned   but just to be safe   i will be giving you a drug test when i get home     captain gregson     how may i be of assistance   gregson  name's casey mcmanus   walked through his front door tonight  and took one right between the eyes   cousin's on the job   patrolman assigned to the 116 in queens   that's why i called you   gotta have my best guys on this   you said on the phone he walked in on a burglar   man  he did  his watch and wallet are gone   the drawers were tossed  too   the victim probably startled the perp  when he came in from the hall   holmes  ms  watson  meet detective bell    another one of my best guys   hi  he's running point on the case   you're the consultant  right   i heard good things   yeah  of course you did  who's he   neighbor from across the hall   he's the one who saw the body through the door and called 911   captain   i'm gonna wait in the hall   why must you continue to act  like you've never seen a dead body before   you were a surgeon  you went to medical school   surely  you worked on cadavers   right  because that's exactly the same thing      detective bell   you would classify this as a robbery homicide  would you not   yeah   you would be wrong   this was a robbery   a homicide   ampersand  not dash   there were two separate crimes committed  by two separate perpetrators   the trajectory of the bullet  that killed mr  mcmanus traces back to this chair   the killer was seated when she pulled the trigger   she   i can smell  t blossom  brand deodorant on the leather   it's lady's deodorant   a woman sat here quite recently   none of your people  of course   this is an active crime scene   and knowing you  captain  they know better   that leaves the shooter   go on   the second crime  the robbery  was committed by a man   a very strong man judging by  the items he removed from the apartment   how strong does a guy have to be  to steal a wallet and a watch   you're forgetting the armoire   dust patterns on the wall and the floor  tell us it stood here   as do these scratches on the floor   you're nuts   actually  he's not   it was a very heavy piece of furniture  that   and this building has no elevator   are we to suppose that the thief got it down  six flights of stairs before the police arrived   of course not   yet the scratches on the floor tell us  it was dragged into the tiled hallway   makes me think it never left this floor   what do you think   yeah  thought so  across the hall you said   you  you can't go in there  you need a warrant   bureaucracy  one of the many reasons i'm not a policeman   gregson  holmes  halt   thief   now all you need is your killer       elementary 1x02     while you were sleeping original air date on october 4  2012     sync  corrected by elderman          casey was already dead when i found him   i know i should've called the cops first   but things have been so bad for me lately   you know  i just    freakin' economy  i     and that armoire was an antique   it's worth two grand at least   but i  i never laid a finger on him   no  you didn't   you put a bullet in his brain   wrong  wrong  wrong  wrong  wrong  wrong  wrong   what's wrong   i'm sorry  i don't think  i could've been much clearer earlier   there were two crimes  two perpetrators   this guy had all of the victim's stuff   but no gun  not anywhere in his apartment   i suspect the gsr test your people performed  will show that he hasn't fired one of late   also  he isn't wearing any deodorant   let alone lady's  t blossom   or hadn't you noticed   you're the only one who could smell anything on that chair   the chair  right   i'm glad you brought that up   if  per detective bell's theory  the burglar was startled  by the victim's unexpected return  why was he sitting down   it's a curious time to take a load off  no   you know what  sherlock   hey  do you mind getting me a bag of chips   i think there's a vending machine around the corner     he wasn't asked to consult here  because of his charming personality   was he always like this   i mean  back when you knew him in scotland yard   he was a pain in the ass   but he was also very  very good   he said when he introduced you last week  that you were his  um   personal valet    that's sort of like a butler  right   you must've been really happy  when he relocated here in new york   actually  he reached out to me  before he left london two weeks ago   he called you from london   yeah  said he was calling from heathrow  why   excuse me   neighbor just won't cop to the shooting   says he wants a lawyer   smart man   he didn't kill anyone  he should get a lawyer   he's also saying that he passed a  strange woman   on the stairwell right before he found the victim's body   excellent  did he get a good look at her   yeah  he can describe her to a t   probably because she's a product of his freakin' imagination   obviously  he heard harry potter here  say something about a female shooter back at the scene   and now he's trying to serve us one on a platter   you need to sit him with a sketch artist   circulate an image of this woman asap   i'm sorry  i got to ask who's running this investigation   you indicated this case was important to the morale of your men   i think this guy's gonna have us chasing some fictional shooter   you really want to run the risk  of pinning the murder on the wrong person   call down to headquarters and get me a sketch artist   but  captain    if he's wrong   he's wrong  but i want to know he's wrong   holmes  that was impressive earlier   noticing the photograph of the armoire at the victim's house   i didn't need it to prove my point   of course  but it helped   you're welcome   um  i've got to go meet my friend soon   you're going to be okay getting home by yourself   this  uh  friend that you're meeting    when was the last time you slept with him   it's quite obvious it's a he and an ex lover   you go out of your way to avoid gender  every time you talk about him  and you avert your gaze every time you say  friend    as to how i know it's not a current lover   your walk speaks volumes   my walk   study in belgium showed  that a woman's recent orgasmic history  can be discerned from her gait   yours would indicate it's been a while   is it sad being wrong as often as you are right   my advice  sleep with him   do wonders for your mood     ty  hey  sorry i'm late  oh  please   i'm the one who should be apologizing   i'm the one who had to reschedule twice   that's true   da's keeping you busy   ah  if i don't keep winning cases for him   how will i ever take his job    uh  how about you   you  uh  just started with a client last week  right   how's it going   good  fine  great   so  what is she   a  uh   alcoholic  addict  both   you know i don't talk about my clients  right   oh  sorry   uh  i know we're not together anymore   but i still worry about you   i'm fine   the thing is  i'm not the only one who's worried   oh  my god  my parents   tell me they didn't reach out to you   they said you're not returning their calls   yeah  well  i don't need a lecture  every time i speak to them  so i     they're confused  joan   you used to be a surgeon  now you babysit drug addicts   i know how much it hurt when you lost that patient   but if you're doing all this as some kind of penance     i am doing this because i'm actually good at it   i don't know why that's so hard to understand   hey  i made coffee   thank you   it'll be right here when you're ready   didn't take my advice  i see   didn't sleep with your ex   what are you working on   casey mcmanus' preliminary autopsy report  came in a little while ago   just going through some of the particulars   i thought there was only one particular    the  uh  gunshot wound to the head   victim also suffered from endothelial corneal dystrophy   oh  that's a gray clouding of the cornea   that's a genetic disorder   but how is that relevant   how is it not   um  can we talk about captain gregson   he's married  i'm afraid  quite happily     you're funny   i was talking to him the other night   and i wanted to know why you didn't tell him  where you were the last six months   he said you called him from heathrow ten days ago  when i know for a fact  that you were in rehab still in new york   you're a highly decorated new york city police captain   would you allow a recovering drug addict  access to sensitive cases  i'm not saying that     i can help him  but only if he lets me   okay  you're not under    telling him would be  a violation of our client companion privilege   i could sue   i am not going to tell him anything  obviously   i just think it's sad that you can't be honest  with a man who  as far as i can tell   is the closest thing you have to a friend    that's all   sherlock holmes   yeah  it's bell   the captain gave me your number   look  i can't believe i'm saying this   but i found the woman from the sketch  that was generated last night   the one the neighbor saw leaving casey mcmanus' apartment   yeah  look  how fast can you get  to st  isidora hospital on east 93rd     i assume you already got one of these   yeah  dark hair  mid 30s  approximately 5'4    captain gregson e mailed me   where is she  i'm getting to that   first i'm gonna tell you how i got here   i was about to put the sketch out wide last night  when one of my old uni buddies said  sketch girl looked familiar   well  he gave me a name   and the name got me to a photograph   yvette ellison   dark hair   mid 30s   i slipped her picture into a photo array for the neighbor   and he picked it out    right away   he said  and i quote   there was no doubt about it    this was the girl he saw on the stairs last night   are you going to make me guess where she is  detective   or are you going to show me   i'm gonna show you   mr  holmes  ms  watson  meet yvette ellison   she tried to kill herself three days ago   chased a vial of sleeping pills with a bottle of vodka   my buddy was on the scene when the paramedics took her away   which is why he recognized her   she's been in a coma ever since   three days ago   yeah  the neighbor lied   made up a description and then id'd  one of the only people in the city we know  couldn't have killed casey mcmanus last night   so thanks for the  uh  consultation   but i think i'll take it  from here   watson  so detective bell was right   is it such a big      shh   yvette   what is wrong with you   closed eyes do not necessarily a coma make   you think she's faking     it's t blossom deodorant    the same as in the crime scene   what are you doing   looking for a syringe   what for   i'm going to stab it  into the softest part of ms  ellison's thigh   lots of nerve endings there    no one can fake their way through that   if you wanted to know  if she was really in a coma   all you had to do was ask   that's okay  but i can't stab her in the thigh   it's a test for pseudocoma   when the patient's hand is released  directly above the face   it should strike the face on the way down   easy to fake   yeah  well   respiration and pupillary response aren't   and hers are consistent with a patient in a comatose state   her coma is real   she didn't kill that man last night     can i help you   your patient   she is   her coma is quite real   watson  that was a dead end   actually it wasn't   detective bell found the right face  but the wrong girl   there was a book on yvette's nightstand   obviously someone's been reading it to her   the inscription on the inside cover said    to yvette and rebecca on your fifth birthday     your fifth birthday   as in the birthday you both share   yvette has a twin   yvette and rebecca ellison were the only children  of charles ellison  who died several months ago   charles ellison   why does that name sound familiar   shipping magnate  multimillionaire   two parks and a school named after him   according to this  rebecca has run  the family's charitable trust for years     so you think casey mcmanus' neighbor  didn't see yvette last night  but her sister   i daresay you're getting the hang  of deductive reasoning  watson   excuse me   could you point us in the direction of rebecca ellison   i'm rebecca ellison   uh  she has dark hair  brown eyes  freckles   i'm sorry  i think you might be confusing me  with my sister yvette   we're fraternal twins  not identical   she's  um  she's not well right now   she's in the hospital   is there something i can help you with   we're good  thanks   having fun   can't you tell   you're still thinking about the case   obviously yvette ellison didn't kill casey mcmanus   but given that his neighbor picked her  out of a photo array   it stands to reason that the real killer  bears a striking resemblance   the question is  who is she and what did she have against casey   well  is it possible that detective bell was right  and that the neighbor was lying about seeing the woman  on the stairs   hey  i found something in the hall closet the other day   was it the zipper mask   'cause i swear i'm just holding that for a friend   it's a trophy from an old case   forgot i still had it   feel free to bin it   uh  i i know it's yours  because it has  s  holmes  engraved under the strings   so i used to play  what of it   well  i just thought it might be a nice addition  to your post rehab regimen   playing an instrument can relieve a lot of stress   you think i'm stressed   i think    you have a lot on your plate  and you're not going easy on yourself  with all this work with the police   i don't play anymore   attic theory   playing took up too much space in my brain  so i stopped   that doesn't even make any sense   you can't unlearn something you already know     five bucks says it's the ex boyfriend   answer it   i'm not going anywhere     ty  hey  hey   bad time   uh  not great   is everything okay   um  what's up   i just left work and wanted to see how you were doing   i'm fine   but you said it wasn't a good time   well  i'm just kind of in the middle of   you know  something    what     oh  my god  what the hell   joan   what is it  is everything okay   uh  ty  i'm gonna have to call you back   you were right about the stress relief   i felt like jimi hendrix  for a second there   you didn't have to do that   thank you  funny name that   noun  verb  nationality  stop changing subjects   stop mucking with my things   i wouldn't have to muck with your things if you would  open up to me  we're supposed to learn about each other    that's how companionship works   good evening  captain   how may i help   uh  you can meet me in queens   there's been another shooting death   looks like the same gun that killed casey mcmanus   well  given casey mcmanus' neighbor  has been in custody since last night   i'd say that officially clears him of the murder   wouldn't you  well  i'm big enough  to admit when i'm wrong  doesn't mean he didn't lie  about the neighbor he claimed to see   shooter was seated again   any thoughts to why     i smell the same deodorant i smelled at the first scene   so we know what our killer smells like   too bad we can't put out an apb on an armpit   watson  sherlock   you said the first victim suffered  from corneal dystrophy  didn't you   what of it   this medicine is used to treat it   news trucks are here  perfect   you want to tell them we got two victims  with no discernible link  or should i   actually  captain  the link is quite discernible   both victims suffered from the same  rare genetic disorder   clouding of the corneas   if you ignore skin color for the moment   you note the  uh   the widow's peak  the bone structure of the face   you tell me they don't look the least bit familiar   casey mcmanus and this woman were more than just linked   they were brother and sister   you were right about the two victims being related   dna test showed that they were half siblings   uh  for what it's worth   the genetic traits here suggest that  the parent they had in common was the father   yeah  our me said the same thing   but according to interviews  with the friends and family members   neither knew the other one existed   casey mcmanus' mom had him out of wedlock   she never told him who his real dad was   ditto for anna webster   far as they knew   they were only children   both shared a mystery dad   both were murdered within a day of each other   obviously not a coincidence   do you think maybe  he was the one who killed them  no   i still think the killer's a woman   but identifying dad  might get us closer to identifying her   surely the victims' mothers  can help on that front   yeah  you'd think   casey's mom died in a car accident in '97   anna webster's died of cancer  2008   neither are talking to anybody   just found this   anna webster filed a complaint a few weeks ago  about a guy she thought was following her   saw him parked outside her home one morning  and snapped a few pictures from her window   now  i'm thinking  maybe that's the father we're trying to find   the age is right   but there's approximately     zero family resemblance   not dad  not by a long shot   i'm pretty sure holmes is right on this one   how   because believe it or not  i know this guy     tommy gregson  as i live and breathe   ha ha  how long has it been  mike   four or five years  hey  mike  how you been   eh  take a long around  you tell me  mike and i  came up together in the department   then he got all high and mighty   he started working for the private sector   became top investigator for white shoe   white shoe here   mike  this is detective bell   ms  watson  and mr  holmes   mike  yeah  any of you thirsty   my girl makes a killer espresso   no  actually  we're sort of on a clock   we were hoping that  you were able to tell us why you  were trailing this girl two weeks ago   uh     i haven't seen her before in my life   mike   um  can't talk about it   it has to do with a case for one of my firm's clients   it's protected by privilege  mike   this girl got killed last night  i know   i saw it on the news and i think it stinks   and she seemed like a good kid   but you know how it is  rules are rules   mike     excuse me   sorry  could you just   excuse me a second    would you mind just telling me a little bit more  about this beautiful plant   you work a lot of late nights  mr  mcgee   i can tell by your eyes  but you know what else i can tell  is that you've turned to methamphetamines  to stay awake and alert   you blink excessively  your eyes dart   you also lost a great deal of weight  over the last few months  even though  your diet's as revolting as ever   and the fact that your carotid has started  jumping up and down like a basketball  makes me think that your stash is nearby   it's in your desk  perhaps   tell us what we need to know right now   and i won't start throwing your drawers open  in front of captain gregson and detective bell   also  um     when you're ready to get your life back on track     hemdale rehabilitation facility  gets my very strongest recommendation   uh  they even have a pool   yeah   uh  tommy  uh    since you and i  go back a ways   i'm gonna  take this file and put it on my desk   i'm gonna go  hit the head   you know  whatever happens in here  while i'm gone  you know    happens   appreciate it  mike  yeah  sure  tommy   sure     casey mcmanus  and anna webster   you hired your lawyers to investigate them  several months ago   why   because you discovered  that casey and anna were your half siblings   your father charles  as successful a businessman  as he was potent a philanderer   sired them out of wedlock decades ago   paid off their mothers to keep them quiet   he told you and yvette  of their existence on his deathbed   now they're both dead   coincidence   i suspect not   what are you talking about   what do you mean  they're both dead   what he means  ms  ellison  is that you don't  have to worry about them coming after your money anymore   holmes  we know that charles left his fortune  to you and yvette  but he failed to include language in his will  that would exclude his bastard children  from laying claim to their share of it   that made them pretermitted heirs  in the eyes of the law  which meant that  if they ever discovered their father's true identity   they'd have been able to sue  for a piece of his considerable estate   potentially reducing you and your sister's inheritance  by as much as two thirds   that's why you hired your lawyers to investigate them   and that's why  i believe you killed them   i didn't kill anyone  can you account  for your whereabouts the last two nights  between the hours of 8 00 p m   and 10 00 p m    i i was    at home   i was alone     that means no   maybe it's time  we took this back to the precinct   rebecca  no   no   look  you're right about my dad   he did tell me and my sister  about casey and anna right before he died   and yes  we knew they could lay claim  to at least part of the estate   it was very difficult for us   we were very angry with him  we couldn't believe  he would keep something like that from us   but he was very sick  and we       after he died  we went back and forth  about what we should do   neither of us wanted to have  to keep his secret   but to give tens of millions  of dollars to two virtual strangers seemed insane   that's why we reached out to his attorneys   we wanted them to look into casey and anna  so we could have all the facts at our disposal   where they lived  perhaps  how one might get into their homes   no  nothing like that   we just wanted to know what kind of people  they were   but then  before we could make any sort of decision     yvette went into a tailspin   she    started seeing a married man   started drinking   and then she tried to kill herself   the  suicide attempt   right   'cause i'm starting to wonder if that's what that really was   i have to assume that with yvette out of the way   you stood to inherit the ellison fortune in its entirety   it wouldn't surprise me to learn that  you found some way to compel her to take those pills   i would never hurt my sister   bell  ms  ellison   if you'll come with us     holmes  just one thing   why disguise yourself as yvette to commit the murders   the witness saw you at the first scene   but he described your sister to a t   i i know that you're a fraternal twin   but with a wig  bit of a makeup   you bear more than a passing resemblance   the question is  why would you want to   what was the point of trying to frame  a woman in a coma   you even put on her deodorant   master stroke  when you think about it   you're insane     she really got you  huh   lefty  caught me by surprise   this one  leathery from slaps   this one  baby's bottom   ty  what the hell are you doing here   what do you mean  what the hell am i doing here   dinner  remember  you said 6 00   i didn't say anything  how did you even find this place   your e mail   you said your friend's having  a dinner party  i should come  ty   such a pleasure   joan's told me so little about you   you hacked my e mail    hack  is such an ugly word   joan  what's going on   what does it look like  ty   it's a soiree   not sure about this  though   bit of a party foul  unless     you know what  this was a mistake   i don't understand  who is that guy   he's my     he's my friend  and he's a prankster     and he brought you here to mess with me   so    he's your boyfriend   no   wow  uh  not even close   you know what  i am so sorry  i'm gonna call you  tomorrow  okay  i backed out of drinks with the da  for this  tell your friend  he's lucky i didn't slug him       if you ever do  swing from the left   where's he going  was it something i said   invading my privacy  not okay   said the walking  talking  professional invasion of privacy   i am here to work with you   i thought you understood that by now   i'm sorry  wasn't it you that said we were  supposed to be learning more about each other   that's how companionship works  is it not   is this because of the violin yesterday   because i think you made your point  when you set it on fire   well  i haven't made my point  unless you've absorbed it   friendship is not a requirement  of cohabitation   i'll keep my secrets  you keep yours   provided i'm still sober in five weeks   we'll go our separate ways  hmm     holmes   it's captain gregson  just thought you should know  we're letting rebecca ellison go   what   searches of her home and business  didn't turn up anything  and security cameras at her apartment  confirm she was there at the time of each murder  just like she said she was   she enters before 7 00 both nights  and doesn't leave until the next morning   she didn't kill casey mcmanus or anna webster   u guys know being up here is  uh  it's a big step   and part of me is       i can't believe  that with everything we have to do   you have dragged me to another addict festival   we have nowhere else to be for the next 45 minutes  but here at this meeting   she tricked them   i don't know how yet  but she tricked them   rebecca ellison   i still think she's the one  that murdered casey mcmanus and anna webster   hmm  would you rather i put myself in another trance   i already thought of that   got it off the board over there   you even think about zoning out   it goes into the softest part of your thigh     lots of nerve endings there   you wouldn't dare   moderator  who'd like to go next   my name is elaine  and i'm an addict   others  hi  elaine    elaine  i am exactly   five more  and i hit my one year mark   i know i i should be proud   i know i should be excited  but i can't be   because i'm not the only one  whose life was ruined by my addiction   my drug was       i'm playing the violin again   the world's smallest   well  i thought you'd be happy   which is why i decided to latch on to a doctor instead   i met this great guy   steven  a gp   and i acted like i was all into him  you know   he was married   he had three beautiful daughters   but i didn't care about that   all i cared about was me and what i needed   when we were together  it was like i didn't even see him   all i saw were the drugs   and eventually  his wife found out and called the police     and     even though i was the one who started it all   he was the one who went to jail   you see  he had taken an oath   he promised to do no harm   but what about the harm i did to him   we have to leave  what   you know you're required by your father to attend these meetings   i just had a breakthrough regarding the investigation   and you want me to sit in a room and tell stories like a child   you don't think i know you'd say anything  to get out of these meetings   if you think these matter   then fine  tomorrow i'll go to two  or ten   but right now i have a killer to stop   tell me what your breakthrough is  what   you said you had some sort of breakthrough   what is it   now  look  there isn't time for this   we need to find out where rebecca ellison is right now   you said earlier we don't need  to be friends  and you're right   but we do need to trust each other   tell me what's going on  and i will try and help you   don't  and i will be the opposite of help   rebecca   for i consider brains   far superior to money in every way   you may have noticed that if one      murderer   you may have fooled the police   you didn't fool me   i know that you're the one  who killed casey mcmanus and anna webster   get out  right now  nurse   the surveillance cameras in your building   the ones that support your so called  alibi    you tampered with them somehow  man  what's going on in here   holmes  i'm on to you  ms  ellison  matter of fact   i'm way ahead of you   i know all about the third pretermitted heir   what  daddy's third bastard   i figured out who she is   mary margaret phelps   don't pretend like you don't already know   you're not that good an actress  holmes  back away   watson  when i couldn't talk you out of coming   i texted him  yes  that's right   the opposite of help  thank you   you know what  it doesn't matter  because as of tonight   mary margaret has her own personal bodyguard   me  i'll be watching her  and i won't let you anywhere near her   that's enough  get off   bell  okay    that's it  come on   you just assaulted a police officer   which means you  get to spend the night in jail  let's go   you haven't seen the last of me  ms  ellison   not by a long shot   i will not let you hurt the third heir  excuse me   do you understand me  i will not let you hurt her   bell  let's go         gregson  put the gun down  ms  ellison   or do you prefer yvette   rebecca  i don't understand   she was in a coma   now she's fine   it wasn't a regular coma   it was medically induced by her doctor   he put her in and brought her out as needed   to kill casey and anna   i don't understand  why would he     because he was the married man  with whom she was having an affair   obviously  she never introduced you   because he was also part of her plan  to protect her money from her father's illegitimate children   when i met him the other day   i noticed a pale stripe of skin on his finger   clearly  he'd recently stopped wearing his wedding band   didn't think anything of it in the moment   but then at a  um   a gathering i attended  this evening  i heard the story  of a woman who seduced her doctor  to take advantage of his medical expertise   and it got me thinking  about you and your sister's predicament   two heiresses learn of the existence  of two half siblings days before  they're set to receive their rather massive inheritance   one has a big heart   the other    hmm   big heart wants to share   get to know these people   welcome them as family   and share with them her many blessings   little heart would rather see them dead   problem is she knows  that only she and one other person  her sister   have motive to kill them   she also knows that this motive   in time  could easily be traced back to her   so what does she do  she finds herself  an alibi that is beyond reproach   she enlists the help of someone with the knowledge  and the expertise  to not only help her stage a suicide attempt   but ease her into a coma   yvette's doctor was arrested a little while ago   he confessed to giving her barbiturates  to keep her unconscious  not only to trick  the machines that monitored her   but also anyone who would want to examine her  when he wasn't around   hmm  it wasn't a perfect plan  of course   between the drugs and the atrophied muscles   she was quite weak   that's why she was seated  when she shot casey and anna   because  in the moment  it was too difficult to stand   i never told you that i wanted to share the money  and yvette didn't   how did you know   why else would she go to these lengths   and what about the third heir   the one whose house yvette broke into   is she okay  she's fine   in that she never existed   i  i made her up   watson  what you saw at the hospital   none of it was real   it was a trap   i made a commotion to draw  yvette's doctor in   i announced the name and address of the heir   mary margaret phelps   so that he'd have them   i then  assaulted   detective bell  so the good doctor would think that i   the only apparent threat to his and yvette's plan   was in jail for the night  allowing them  a very crucial window of opportunity   and they took it   because even though  neither of them had even heard  of the third heir before tonight   they couldn't take any chances   as for the woman yvette trailed to her home     she's an officer here at the precinct   i have to contact our attorneys   i need to see if they can help her   i know what she did  is unforgivable   but she is still my sister  there were only  two pretermitted heirs  ms  ellison   yvette killed the second one yesterday   so tell me   why was she still in a coma today   why didn't she miraculously wake up this morning   who did she have left to kill   do you think  perhaps  it was someone who stood  between her and the entirety  of the family fortune   you mind that big heart  ms  ellison   it'll beat longer   gregson  you taking off   case is closed  is it not   it is   which is why you should come join us for drinks in a bit   bell here is buying   i'm under orders   that said  i  uh   appreciate the help you gave us   gregson  so what do you say   drinks   in about an hour   another time  perhaps   all right   more malodorous takeout  how wonderful   what is this  five nights in a row   it's mediterranean  i hope you like garlic   you'd think that for what  my father is paying you  you'd learn to cook     what  you want to talk  about what happened in the support meeting tonight   something happened   you listened  you let  someone else's natterings penetrate  that attic you call a skull  and it helped you catch a killer   you want a thank you  fine  thank you   do you you close yourself off to people  and deny yourself things that might bring you pleasure     not because it makes you a better investigator   but because it's some sort of penance   penance   for what happened in london   being addicted   i don't know  i guess it just occurred to me  that it might be something  that someone might do and not even know it   well  you always know it  watson   if you didn't   it wouldn't be penance       take          my hand          if it gets you through  then it's all right          take my hand          but if you're    golden          then it's with a sense of regret             then you'll never know          how it feels          to have hope          to have hope          to have hope           to have hope                      sync  corrected by elderman
