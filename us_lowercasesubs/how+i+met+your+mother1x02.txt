 okay  where was i   you were telling us how you met mom   in excruciating detail   right  so  back in 2005  when i was 27  my two best friends got engaged   and it got me thinking  maybe i should get married   and then i saw robin   she was incredible   i just knew i had to meet her   that's where your uncle barney came in   i suggest we play a little game i like to call  have you met ted    wait  no  no  no  we're not playing  have you met ted    hi  have you met ted   so i asked her out   and i know this sound crazy  but after just one date   i was in love with her which made me say something stupid   i think i'm in love with you   what    oh  dad   so then what happened   nothing   i mean  i'd made a complete fool of myself   so  a week went by  and i decided not to call her   so you're not gonna call her   you went from   i think i'm in love with you  to  i'm not gonna call her    i wasn't in love with her  okay   i was briefly in love with the abstract concept of getting married   it had absolutely nothing to do with robin     robin    hi   look who i ran into   since when do you guys know each other   oh  since about    here   lily recognized me from the news and     hello  sailor   they just got engaged   well  i should get back to the station   see you  guys     nice seeing you  ted    yeah  you  too     dawn it    what     i'm in love with her    no   as your sponsor  i will not let you relapse   you blew it  it's over  move on   i don't know  i just have this feeling she's the future mrs  ted mosby   lily  you squeaked   she said something about me  didn't she   come on  spill it  red   fine   so  what do we think of ted   ted's something else   huh   i'm gonna spin that as good   lots of guys are something  i'm something else   comes on a little strong   but  that's part of my charm   but  that's part of his charm   oh  totally  i mean  he's sweet  he's charming   he's just looking for something a little bit more serious than i am   i mean  the most i can handle right now is something casual   this just stays between us  right   are you kidding   this flapper  fort knox   oops   she wants casual   okay  i'll be casual   i'm going to be a mushroom cloud of casual   you know why   cause it's a game    i want her to skip to the end and do the whole happily ever after thing   but you don't get there unless you play the game   so  are you going to ask her out   yeah    no   i can't ask her out  because if i ask her out  i'm asking her out   so  how do i ask her out without asking her out   did you guys get high   i got it   i don't ask her out   i invite her to our party next friday   we're having a party next friday   we are now   casual   yeah  cause nothing says  casual  like inviting a hundred people over just to mack on one girl   oh  and lily  that's my leg   you waited five minutes to tell me that   all right  so call her up   no  calling's not casual   i just got to bump into her somewhere   now  if only i knew her schedule  i could arrange a chance encounter   that's great  ted   you'll be the most casual stalker ever   ever since marshall put that ring on her finger   lily had been  well  extra affectionate   baby  no   i have a 25 page paper on constitutional law due monday   i barely started   hey  i'm just sitting here   wearing my ring   my beautiful ring   kind of makes wearing other stuff seem wrong   like my shirt   kind of don't want to wear my shirt anymore   or    my underwear   that's right  i'm not wearing any   no underwear   not even slightly   guys   boundaries   there she is   thanks  bill   i'm

trifecta    wow  okay  well  i'll be there   great  see you tonight   so  that was robin   so  i threw a third party for robin     on a sunday night   well  this is lame   lame     or casual   lame   or casual   hey  law books   ready for a little 15 minute recess   sorry  baby  i got to work  i need all my blood up here   has anybody seen an introduction to contract tort and restitution statutes from 1865 1923   anybody seen a big ass book   no   hello  barney   of course   you look well   is it weird they invited both of us   who   who invited you  no one even knows who you are   i understand you're hurt  but  you don't have to be cruel   carlos was right about you   who is carlos    hey  where the hell is my      oh      okay     an introduction to contract tort and restitution statutes from 1865 1923  is not a coaster   ted  i'm jeopardizing my law career so you can throw not one   not two  but three parties  for some girl that you just met who's probably not even going to show up   i mean  where is she  ted  huh   where's robin   hi   hi  ron   so  you threw all these parties for me   no  oh  you thought that    no   i    okay  yes  you got me   one of the reasons i threw these parties was so that i could introduce you  to  um  this guy   uh  i figured  you know  since it didn't work out between us  and now we can just laugh about it     anyway  robin  this is     carlos     oh    oh   she's still talking to carlos   i can still win this  i it's not over   okay  buddy  time for the tough talk   robin seems great  but let's look at the facts   you want to get married   and right now  there's a million women in new york looking for exactly you   but robin ain't one of them   she's not just one of them  she's the one   yeah  well  the one is heading up to the roof   what are you going to do   nothing   it's a game  i got to just keep playing it   ted     hey  carlos  can you give us a minute   hey  no sweat  hombre   see ya   robin     look  i didn't throw this party to set you up with carlos   or the one before that   or the one before that   i threw these parties because i wanted to see you   well  here i am   there's something here  look  unless i'm crazy   you're not crazy   i don't know  ted   i mean  we barely know each other  and you're looking at me with that look  and  it's like     like  like what   like   let's fall in love and get married  and have kids and drive them to soccer practice    i'm not going to force sports on them unless they're interested   it's a great look   but you're looking at the wrong girl     no  i'm not    yes  you are   i don't want to get married right now  maybe ever   and  if we got together  i'd feel like i'd either have to marry you or break your heart  and     i just couldn't do either of those things   just like you can't turn off the way you feel   click   off  let's make out   what   what  that was the off switch   and i turned it off   i mean  look  sure  yes  i want to fall in love  get married  blah  blah  blah   but  on the other hand    you  me   the roof   there's no off switch   there is an off switch   and it's off   no  it's not   yes  it is   no  it's not   yes    it is   no  it's not   you're right  there's no off switch   god  i wish there was an off switch   me  too   so  um     what do we do now   we could be friends   oh     look  i know it sounds insincere when people say that  but     we could   i don't know  robin   i've made such a jackass of myself here   we start hanging out  every time i see you it'll be like   oh  that's right  i'm a jackass    you're not a jackass   look  i'm sorry  i only moved here in april  and i'm always working and  i just haven't met a lot of good people so far   but i understand   well  uh  maybe in a few months  after it's not so fresh   we could all  uh  you know  get a beer   yeah   that sounds good   i'll see you  ted   or  you know  now   we could all get a beer now   i'd like that   my friends
