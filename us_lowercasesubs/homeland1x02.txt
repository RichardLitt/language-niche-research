are you going to reenlist   would you ever go back out there  sergeant   how does it feel to be home again  sir   sir  are you going to reenlist   i've been going over brody's finger tapping  with the crypto team  and i hate to say it  saul   but there's little  if any  repeat pattern combination   not even a quadratic basis to work with here   i'll keep trying as long as you need  but there's nothing  definitive one way or the other yet   keep looking   i want to leave no stone unturned on this   we'll talk later   what do you think   oh  definitely an original     by one of the preeminent dutch painters of his time   relatively recent acquisition  if i'm not mistaken   by an artist who  as it turns out   was not only dutch  but also jewish   in a club with no jewish members   that was your point  wasn't it   how do you take it   your honor  i'm not asking for anything  that hasn't been granted  many thousands of times over in the last ten years   a surveillance warrant on an unspecified subject  on american soil   if this were a standard request   you'd go through standard procedure  saul   in this case  i don't have time  for a government lawyer to petition the court   so you're asking me to issue a fisa warrant directly to     what is it exactly do you do at langley these days   among other things  pay house calls  to those i'd prefer not to have to     strong arm   disturb   are you ever gonna let me off your hook  saul   well     we both know you're far too fine a judge for that  geoffrey   can we at least act like this is about the law  rather than a brief moment of weakness in my past   this is absolutely about the law  your honor   hmm   shit   hey  maggie  it's me   sorry i haven't called in a while  i been slammed   um  thought i'll come see you guys for a night   if that's good with you   uh    call me back  let me know   thanks  bye   i've got a doorbell  you know   well  you think you still have  a right to privacy with all this   my god  look at this place   it's broken    the doorbell   what's that   this gives you four weeks   you got a warrant  a fisa warrant   we're legal now   legal ish  but far from official   and certainly not estes proof   be very careful not to mistake this for a stamp of approval   or sanction from me  for you to wage some sort of personal war   eyes on brody makes complete sense   it's exactly what you'd have done in my shoes  saul   no  it is not   you lied to me about it  carrie   then right here in this room  when i called you on it     i know what i did   and i know it was wrong     and insulting   insulting     and barely scratches the surface of what that was   four weeks  carrie   not a second longer   i want to show you something   he has nightmares   where he repeatedly begs  someone to kill him  in arabic   he's too ashamed or scared or both to face the press  outside his house or take calls  from the tv news  so what does he do   he finds shelter in the corner of the bedroom   where he hasn't moved in over five hours   all of which makes complete sense  after eight years of captivity   but what if it's more than that   if if brody had really been turned  as you say   you know what he'd more likely be doing by now   talking to the press outside his house   doing tv interviews   playing the hero card for every penny it's worth   maybe it's not that simple for him   get some sleep  carrie   no one said becoming a terrorist was easy  saul   if you'd been taken prisoner   tortured for god knows how long  and somehow  finally been turned   then  one day  you come home   and suddenly it's real  it's on   well  that's one interpretation   but that's all it is at the moment   clean your apartment   and eat some real food   raised in colorado springs   attended byu   interests  finance  travel  men   stacey moore  this is latif bin walid   majordomo for his highness  prince farid   please continue   would you say you're outgoing  or more the quiet type  stacey   i'd say more outgoing   definitely social   i like to party  if that's what you mean   do you drink   i'm not a drinker  per se   if that's what you mean   stacey     you are interviewing for a job that pays  in two years   more than most people in this country earn in 20   if you're successful in this interview   you'll be required to appear self possessed  confident   modest and reticent all at the same time   so  stop asking what i mean   think and answer for yourself   do you enjoy anal sex   excuse me   how about other women   sure   both   have you ever dated any famous men   that's none of your business   you need to wax that  sweetie   hair down there's not an option for his highness   very nice   you're through the final interview   we'll contact you

ourselves to some of your hooch   thought we would stop by for a     for a situation report on sergeant brody   situation report on brody is this   he's been back three days   and it's gonna take a little more time until he's willing  to come out of his shell  let alone his house   the man represents a significant victory in the war on terror   thanks to our friends at the cia   i'm putting aside for the moment  that sergeant brody owes them his life   these are the facts   bin laden's dead     and america thinks  or wants to think   that this war is drawing to an end   politicians are pushing for a  wholesale withdrawal from afghanistan   but as we all know  captain   the terrorists are still out there    after blood   we need brody in the public eye   reminding america that this is far from over   what if he's not up for it    psychologically   fuck it   drive on   isn't that what you marines say   in combat  where we also shit in saran wrap and shoot to kill   you want brody to do that  too   don't take that tone with me  captain   career pencil pusher  with his brown nose in my scotch  saying   fuck it  drive on    you're a captain in the united states marines   you mean to tell me you can't give a sergeant a direct order   is that what you want me to report up the chain   look  mike  i get it   you and brody are friends  right   by the way   how's his wife jennifer doing   jessica   if not for us  brody should at least do it for her   for the kids   and i'm sure you're more than familiar  with their current financial problems   dod's offering a very generous reenlistment package   plus a promotion   that could pull his family out of the shitter   give your friend the correct advice  captain   make it happen   where does mom keep the pancake mix   the what      you're toast  asswipe   found it   hey  dad     what's it like to kill somebody   can i help you   yeah  just a couple questions  sergeant brody   nick  can i call you nick   you got ten seconds

north   okay  call me back when you find him   shit   who left this pan on the stove   chris   where's dad            you know  the whole reason i left the company  and went freelance was so i could have a life   you're becoming my wife's least favorite person   i've got incoming humint i got to go deal with   who is it   someone i recruited  in bahrain a few years ago   professional girlfriend of a saudi prince   what's she got   we'll find out soon enough   you got anything to eat   um    yeah   there's a yogurt in the fridge   lynne  how are you   okay  fine  i guess   w what are you doing here in d c    prescreening more girls for the prince's harem   he gets in tomorrow    what's the code red   so  there i am  five days ago  in cypress  on prince farid bin abbud's yacht     when the prince's majordomo  latif bin walid   announces that the prince has a surprise visitor   so  this surprise visitor  who was he   you know that they stone women like me to death  if we get caught doing anything that we're not supposed to   abu nazir   i was this far from him   i really don't want to do this anymore  and i mean it  carrie   i feel like i can't even breathe now   they're gonna suspect something   lynne  all you have to do now is keep your eyes and ears open  for the remainder of your contract with the prince   that's what you said when you recruited me in bahrain   but i never thought that i would get eight feet  from the most dangerous terrorist in the world   you are the only agency asset  to have had eyes on nazir in seven years   asset   i am just some girl from sandusky  ohio   who you talked into helping out her country   and i won't let anything happen to you   don't quit on me now  please  you can't   don't think i don't appreciate what it took  for you to do this  lynne   saul berenson   alert the group  saul   inform estes   this is a game changer   can't be more specific   i don't want to talk on an open line   source protection   it's way past source protection  saul   i've got a visual confirm on the sandman     what    you heard me   actual eyes on   how far away are you    i'll assemble the group   what are you doing here   have to talk

an hour ago  maybe more   why didn't you call me right away  jess   what the hell is that   he has nightmares   brody did that   or flashbacks  whatever you call them   i have to make it work with brody  i have to   this is where he tells you everything's gonna be okay   it's gonna be okay  jess   is it really   do you honestly think so   ugh   that's disgusting  carrie   this is the first confirmed sighting  of abu nazir in seven years   and very much to your credit   nobody's arguing with that   but it's not enough to authorize a task force   i'm not asking for that   all i need is a few more bodies on sergeant brody   look  the circle's small   we keep it that way till you have more than  just a theory linking brody and abu nazir   so abu nazir's resurfacing just as  brody has miraculously returned home means nothing   it's just a coincidence   the dots are there  carrie  but you haven't connected them yet   saul  i understand that you're still furious with me   but give me something here  please   i'm not telling you to stop   i'm telling you to slow down   the fisa warrant    that gives you four weeks   use it   carefully  methodically   look  like it or not  you work

row first   where is he now   i don't know   what do you mean you don't know   he can't have gone far   listen to me  if brody has  one 15 second meeting with one contact   that's all it'll take   i'm not gonna miss that   find him and find him fast   call me back   last 14 days of  air traffic data from all airports    commercial  cargo   and the banks   all new patterns and numerical transactions

we have no idea of knowing who's watching   if abu nazir even smells we're onto the prince  he'll vanish   into thin air  again   it's the qrt's job not to be detected   you're saying you can't trust those guys  to protect an asset in danger   it's my job to make the tough calls  carrie   the answer is no   your job is to control your asset   she needs backup  you're it  get it done   yes  sir
