   harrison wright    quinn perkins     i can't stay    what are you drinking   i can't stay  i'm sorry   i only came because lori wouldn't give me your number so i could cancel   and i didn't want you to be waiting here  because getting stood up in this particular bar  is like falling face down on a runway   and even though i don't know you   lori's got this annoying habit of meddling     so it seemed only decent      what are you drinking   i can't stay  is what i am saying  i don't do blind dates   my parents met on a blind date  they've been inseparable ever since   i'm happy for your parents  and for you   because it means you exist  but i don't do blind dates     this isn't a blind date    what   it's a job interview  what are you drinking   dirty martini  what do you mean this is a job interview     this is a job interview    you're a baby lawyer     you're 12 years old    i am 28 years old   why aren't we sitting in an office in a law firm   'cause that's not how we do job interviews     i didn't apply for a job with you    you did     i didn't    you did   okay  you know what  this has been    whatever     but i don't do blind dates  so      ask me who i work for     what    you  really wanna ask me who i work for   fine  who do you work for   olivia pope   olivia pope  the olivia pope   wait  shut up   is this some kind of ploy to make me stay on this date   quinn  this is not a blind date   on blind dates  i like to buy a woman dinner  because it makes her more likely to either sleep with me  or give me a second date  when i buy you dinner   you'll know i'm interested   you did apply for a job with me   the way i know you applied for a job with me  is that i have your r sum  on my ipad   the way i know you'd kill puppies to get this job  is the way you stopped breathing when i said the name olivia pope   which is a tell  your tell  which you should look at   'cause i'm going to offer you a crap salary and you'll have to take it   'cause you never really learned how to breathe in and out without stopping   but don't feel bad  because we all get paid crap salaries   because we're the good guys  i'm a good guy   which means i generally don't lie  but i just did to you   this is not a job interview   wait  i don't    i'm confused   olivia already told me to hire you  the job is yours if you want it   the best job you'll ever have  you'll change lives  slay dragons   love the hunt more than you ever dreamed   because olivia pope is as amazing as they say   and  uh    i'm not a baby lawyer   i'm a gladiator in a suit   'cause that's what you are when you work for olivia   you're a gladiator in a suit  do you wanna be a gladiator in a suit   you gotta say it   i wanna be a gladiator in a suit   sync and corrections by majtjkong  we're going to get killed   did you propose  weren't you going to ask her tonight   i was doing this tonight  liv  we're gonna get killed   we're  3 million short   so you flaked  why are we short   the ambassador couldn't come up with the rest   which is a problem  a very big problem   why we shouldn't even be going up there in the first place   and i did not flake  i'm working  for you   don't worry  they'll take what we give them   did you at least buy the engagement ring   ukrainian mobsters do not take what you give them   they just shoot you  so we have bigger things to worry about  than me not proposing to my girlfriend   we are in a situation here  focus  do what you do   good evening  gentlemen     you got the money    of course  all three million     we said six    did we     we did    i have three   that's a problem   well  it's all the ambassador had on such short notice   so you're just gonna have to take it   leave the three  when you come back with the rest       liv      we have a deal     that's not gonna happen  oskar    no   nyet  what's going to happen is   you and vlad are going to take the three million  and leave right now for dulles to make your flight to the motherland   the reason you're going to want to go right now   beside the fact that it's just good travel sense  to give yourself enough time for international check in   is in exactly four hours and 15 minutes   both of your names are going to suddenly pop up  on homeland security's no fly list   lucky for you  you're booked on a flight that leaves in two and a half hours   so if it were me  i'd much rather spend  3 million in kiev  than here in georgetown  way more bang for your buck   in fact  it may even feel like six once you're there   good boys  so  since we have a deal   i am gonna take what we paid for   pleasure doing business with you   i thank you  my client thanks you  and i hope to never see you again   god  i love this job   do i look okay   too much cleavage  olivia will talk about you   just take it in   this is huck  he's our tech guy  used to be cia  right  huck     i don't talk about that  new girl    new girl   are you sure she's here  it's late   she's here  she's always here  that's stephen  that's abby   he's a litigator  she's an investigator     and that's      olivia pope   come on   i'm not doing it   well  i'm not doing it either    don't look at me     how'd it go    we gave them three million   they gave us the package   three million down  the woman doesn't flinch   we're just waiting for pick up   too much cleavage   i'm sorry  i didn't know that i was coming here   can i just say that i am a huge fan   i so admire your work in the white house   it is an honor to work for your law firm   we're not a law firm  we're lawyers  but this is not a law firm     law firms are for pansies  we solve problems   manage crises  save reputations   right  of course  it's still an honor   harrison feed you a line about being a gladiator in a suit     liv    he did  and i am ready to gladiate   or whatever   you know how to gladiate a diaper change   thank you   thank you  when the russians kidnapped him   i thought     but you've returned my son back to me   thank you   anything i can do for you  anything   if you ever have a second child   olivia's a beautiful name   mr  ambassador  you can take your son back  to the consulate and keep him safe   and you can never tell anyone about this   the fbi is sick of me   of course   thank you   thank you   good work  everyone   so  what     we've got incoming   it's after hours  take a message  we're going home   not on the phone  here   and you wanna talk to him   you have to help me  somebody has to help me   please  my girlfriend  she's dead   the police think i killed her   welcome to olivia pope and associates   lieutenant colonel sullivan  sully  st  james   age 32  did two tours in iraq   was injured saving the lives of his entire unit     a war hero    and not just any war hero   the first living marine awarded the medal of honor  for action in any war since vietnam   a famous war hero  working class   patriotic  comes from a long line of soldiers   here he is with the president   also  sexiest man alive  2010   poster boy for the military   and for the conservative right   that's how he makes his living  he gives expensive speeches   makes a fortune  he's anti choice  pro gun   hates the gays and likes it when kids pray in school     abby    just saying he sickens me politically     i'm not saying we shouldn't help him    who is the dead girlfriend   paige montgomery  27  rich girl  good family   it's on the police scanners   girl was found dead in her apartment  three shots to the head   three  that's not an accident   sully called 911  but took off before the police arrived   what do we    can i ask   what do we do  i mean  if we aren't defense lawyers   we're not the state's attorney  it looks like he did it   so what do we do  what can we do   first  we interview sully   i was gonna propose   we were gonna get married   paige was everything to me   she was my best friend   we listen to him  we watch him   did you kill her   no  i would never   i loved her   where'd the blood come from   in this moment  we are the judge and we are the jury   the media and the public opinion   went to her apartment and i found her like that   i held her  but there was so much blood   i called the police and i panicked   i'm on tv  you know  so  i didn't know what to do   i thought that they would think that i did it   i panicked  i'm sorry   this is the moment where we decide who he is   where were you  during the murder   i walk at night  around the neighborhood  i was walking   and i stepped into matty's pub  and then i had a beer   and then i kept walking  then i went to go see paige   do you own a handgun   not since i left the military   i just don't believe she's actually gone   i vote no  the guy's a fugitive covered in blood   not once did he question who killed paige   or ask us to find her killer  we all know that's a red flag  he did it   no  i don't think he did   he's a soldier  a government issue trained killing machine   he'd have to be an idiot to get her blood all over himself   call 911 and then run  but i still vote no   it's a media hand grenade   i don't wanna take it because it's too messy   too much work  and i hate republicans   my vote always comes down to my gut   my gut tells me everything i need to know   we're taking the case   why do we even bother voting   you're pretty and smart  so pretty  so smart   next i set the rules   we're going to give you a clean shirt and put you in stephen's office   you are to stay there   no phone calls  not to work  not to friends  not to press   no one  this is on us now   your job is to stay in that office and let us do our job   then i warn them  i always warn them   i have one rule  do not lie   you lie  all bets are off  got it   now  is there anything else you wanna tell me   i didn't kill her   she was my best friend   i loved her   why am i not surprised that you're on this   you have to give me 48 hours before you arrest or charge sully st  james   i was sleeping   the u s  attorney's office never sleeps     you told me that once    i was being ironic   forty eight hours before you arrest or charge   olivia  you don't have the muscle of the white house  behind you anymore   you're just a private citizen who is  by the way  annoying   he's a decorated war hero   he's a patriot  you realize the blowback you'll get  for rushing to judgment on a patriot   the blowback you'll create   well  yeah  that's my job   do you actually have the naive belief  that waking me in the middle of the night and threatening me  is the correct path to getting your way   i wasn't threatening you  he didn't kill her   my gut says he didn't   your spidey senses aren't evidence   i've been on the phone with homicide  he killed her and ran   i can have a reporter out here in 20 minutes   with cameras  asking why you are persecuting  an innocent  handicapped  medal of honor winner   perhaps because he's a well known conservative republican  and you are considering a bid on the democratic ticket next year   just to be clear  that was me threatening you     you have until morning    thirty six hours     twenty four hours    sold   pleasure to see you again   hey  wally  body still here or did the morgue take it already   go home  i'm not telling you a thing   you don't have to  i'll just take a quick peek at the crime scene   not on my watch   how's your wife  wally  she's what  six months pregnant   does she know about the stripper   you're a real bitch  you know that   i do know that  wally   so you guys don't try cases  you don't go to court   if we do our jobs right  we never need to go to court   no  look  the reason we're not a law firm is  we don't have to play within the rules of the law   we're fixers  crisis managers   we make the problems of our client  big or small  go away   it's not about solving a crime  it's not about justice   it's about our client     no    lisa     no    lisa     you didn't call me    i'm an ass   who slept with me and didn't call me   i'm getting married   you  you're getting married  you   her name is georgia  she teaches third grade   which is why  as much as i would like to   i can't do it with you in the freezer anymore   what do you want   i need you to fast track an autopsy  slip me the report   we've been here all night   hey  don't you people ever sleep   don't any of you have husbands  wives and kids  lives     no    oh   gladiators  in suits   we need more   the guy's alibi is water  bloody clothes and he's a runner  he killed her   definitely killed her   there  gun was found on the scene   i'll work the cops  find out if there are any fingerprints on the gun   and there  look at them   look how he's looking at her  he loves her   a guy in love only kills if he has a motive   if he has a motive  we need to find it before the police do   i have to step out   i'll be back   we need more   so what happens now   she wants more  we get more   what   hi  hello  how are you    hi  hello  how are you  what   you working the sully st  james thing   i'm trying to stamp out the flames   if you guys could refrain from commenting       what's your gut say    he didn't do it   well  your gut's never wrong  we'll stay quiet   but keep me in the loop   you didn't ask me here to talk about sully st  james     he needs a favor    i don't work for him anymore     he trusts you    i don't work for him anymore   and yet you came when i called   what   there's a girl  an aide   going around saying she's sleeping with him     is she    liv   bill clinton  monica lewinsky  john edwards  rielle hunter  is she   no  you know him  he's not that guy   i need you to shut her down     i need to see him    liv  that's not possible   if you want me to shut her down   then i need to look him in the eye and know he's not lying   he's not     look  the man's schedule is insane  he has no time to see you   he wants the favor   he wants my services  i do not work for him anymore   so  you tell the president of the united states to make time     you're going    i'm going     to camp david    i won't be gone long   you're going to camp david to meet with the president  why   meeting at the white house is too official  press is there   he wants you to take your old job back  doesn't he  he's wooing you   he's not wooing me  we're friends   you and i are friends  he's the leader of the free world   your life makes me feel unsuccessful   stay on sully  text me if anything happens  i'll be back soon   hey  should i really do it   yes   i'm talking about asking georgia to marry me     yes    because i was thinking  i'd buy the ring today  but now with sully     stephen  do you want me to talk you into it or out of it   into it  out of it  no  into it   normal lives  that's the dream   you love her  she loves you  normal people get married   you won't even date   i'm not normal   huck finally managed to hack paige's e mail   i've been reading them and i think i found something   paige sent an e mail to a friend  ariel masse   on the night of the murder  they were supposed to attend    an embassy party together    so  why didn't she go   i don't know   don't ever say   i don't know    olivia doesn't believe in  i don't know     she asks you why  you better have an answer  abby   yeah  paige and i were supposed to go to the french consulate dinner     what happened    she called at the last minute  and she canceled  no big deal   ariel  if there's something you're not telling me     look  you have to understand  paige loved sully   she used to be  we both used to be  you know  party girls   always out  always with a different guy  and then paige met sully  and she just settled down with him  you know   it made her family really happy  they were amazing together   oh  i just can't believe she's dead   ariel  you can cry  that's understandable   but it's not going to make me go away   what aren't you telling me   in other news  white house press secretary  joyce armstrong is saying that  as of now   president grant will issue no comment regarding war hero  sullivan st  james' possible involvement

the sully st  james thing   i can't thank you enough for taking this on   her name is amanda tanner   she's 27  i've got rumors she might be talking   and you can't fire her   not without a nightmare on our hands   look  as yet she hasn't gone to the press   i'd like to put a stop to it before she does   it's not right   it makes me look like a dirty old man   i have to ask     no   i never  i would never  no   you've known me a long time  longer than most   you know i did not fall for some young girl   you know there's only one person i love   mellie and fitz are happy together  liv   he'd

  you have an hour and then i need you to come with me   impress her     can i ask      you're acting as my witness   just stay by my side  don't say anything   cute dog  golden retriever   yeah  his name's thomas jefferson   which is lame  i know  but he's very presidential   aren't you  tj   amanda  it would be a mistake to think  there will be no consequences to you telling lies about the president   how do you know my name  who are you   my name is olivia pope  and i want to be clear   i'm not here in any official capacity  i'm only here to warn you   because you should know what could happen   it could become hard for you to find employment   your face would be everywhere   people would associate you with a sex scandal   all kinds of information about you would easily become available to the press   for example  you've had  also there's that ugly bout of gonorrhea   and your family  your mother's mental illness   a psychotic break  two years at bedford hospital   i bet that's private  she runs a daycare now  right   he told me he loved me  he gave me this dog   see  it's those kind of lies that could hurt you  if you said them to other people  people not as nice as me   i'll give you some free advice  hand in your resignation   and pack up your dog and your things  get in your car and go   find a small city  minneapolis  maybe  or denver   get a little job  meet a boring boy  make some friends   because  in this town  your career is over   you're done   why are you doing this to me  i'm a good person   you know who else was a good person  monica lewinsky   and she was telling the truth  but she still got destroyed   if you get subpoenaed in front of a grand jury   you can testify as an officer of the court that i was working on my own   i didn't blackmail or threaten her   if you don't get subpoenaed  this never happened   it's handled   are you crying     this is the ladies' room    are you crying     no    yes  you are     no  i'm not    you are   fine  i'm crying   well  don't let olivia see you doing that   she doesn't believe in crying   she doesn't believe in    what is that  who says that   olivia  she says that   can i ask you   why did she hire me   she must get 100 r sum s  why me  what about me   what about me says    stand next to me while i decimate a girl walking her dog    you're here because you worship her  you wanna be her   you think if you're near her  if you stand in her light   then you'll finally do stuff that matters   because you need to believe that there's something greater  than a nine to five crap job  that there's a higher purpose   that your life has meaning   because the world feels big and you feel lost  am i right   olivia pope fixes things  that's who she is   you need fixing  i don't know your story  i don't need to know   we all have a story  everyone in this office needs fixing   you're a stray dog  and olivia took you in   don't question it   no crying  we don't cry   ever   the president and the first lady are  just now returning to the white house   where tonight they will be hosting a state dinner  for president sarkozy and the french first lady   even though many see this as a positive move  in relations between the two countries  opposition     cyrus beene    put him on  i just need a second   olivia needs you   hi  liv   did you buy her a dog     what    just answer the question   no  of course not  why do you ask   do me a favor  turn your head a little to the left   okay  sorry  forget i asked  thank you  mr  president   sully's on the crawl on the big three cable news stations   all over drudge  network news is still hours away   but diane sawyer's already sniffing   i've got good  i've got bad  i've got ugly   the good  tom henderson spilled his guts  the minute i leaned on him  bad  he has an airtight alibi   he was working as a bouncer at a club at the time of the murder    ugly   henderson claims that sully knew he was sleeping with his girlfriend     which gives sully motive    even uglier   the gun found in the murder has sully's prints all over it     which gives him means    damn it   did you know paige was sleeping with tom henderson     what    did you know   i hired you  you can't come in here and     yes  she can  she can do whatever the hell she wants  because without her  you are definitely going to jail   my guess is 20 years  but if they get fancy   a life sentence is a possibility  is that what you want   did you know paige was sleeping with tom henderson   yeah  yeah  i knew   look over our statement  make sure it uses the words     get me five soldiers  preferably with bars on their uniforms   who are willing to attest to sully's heroism and kindness on the record   wait  wait  i did not kill paige   paige  she slept around a lot before   i would have forgiven her   but i didn't kill her  you have to believe me   sully  your fingerprints are on the gun   that's because i picked it up off of the floor   i am a soldier   now  i have looked into the faces of men as i killed them   i know what it means to take a life   i don't know how a person could do this to someone they loved   i loved paige  she was my best friend   i did not kill her   find me somebody  anybody   who can say they saw sully at the time of the murder   make his alibi stick     liv    i believe him   abby  i believe him  go make his alibi stick   i'll get the car   in a minute     huck  did you talk to my guy    yeah     you got it    i got it   what   open it     they're engagement rings    yes   they're engagement

normal   you can't just    you're bullying me   as long as i've known you   you've dated a series of women i can only describe as trashy  and too young for you and most of all  stupid   georgia is funny and fun  and old enough and brilliant   and you know you want to marry her   we all know you want to marry her   so pick a damn ring already  so we can go find an alibi for sully st  james
