 sync by honeybunny              uh  uh     raaarrhh   come on    uh   yeah   uh     rrrrah       oh what do you know about it   just fucking go   hold your fucking tongues   let the roman have his say   thrace and the republic  have known their differences   we've not always been as brothers   but let us put aside such matters   uniting in just cause   you pushed your way into our land   and now you stand asking for our help   your hand extended   i extend no hand  i am here merely to inform   mithridates and his greeks  attack from the east     encroaching from the black sea   far removed from our villages   true  but the getae  take advantage of the distraction   their barbarian hordes amass to the north   barely half a week's march from your villages   how many   thousands     align yourselves with rome   pledge your service to the auxiliary  and join us in our campaign   to what end   to what end    victory   and how is it to be measured   the getae have raided our villages in the past   raped our women  killed our children   each time have pushed them back   only to see them return   he speaks out of turn   yet the truth falls from his mouth   if we are to align with rome   the purpose must be clear   the getae dead   all of them   dead  all of them     the council has decided   we go to war   i've asked the gods to bless your sword   once the getae are wiped from our lands   there'll be no reason to ever pick it up again   and what would my husband do without it in his hands   grow crops  raise goats   make children     you'd fight no more   forever  to be by your side   how soon do you march   first light   then come to bed   if one night is all we have left     i should make the most of it     be strong my wife   i woke expecting my wife beside me   she rose early to pray   that her husband would stay with her   i thought were in agreement   we were  were   the gods came to me last night   in my sleep   what did they show you   my husband on his knees   bowing before a great red serpent   the life draining from his veins   what meaning did you take from it   a warning   if you go to war   you are destined for great and unfortunate things   the getae worship the mountain wolf   they place no faith in snakes   it was just a dream   and if it isn't   i gave my word  sura   blood and honor   it speaks to the man   nothing will keep me from returning to your arms   not the getae  not the romans   not the gods themselves   the nights grow so cold   what am i to do without you in our bed   lift your dress   keep me close to your thighs   the thought will warm us both   kill them all   for you   charge     rahhh   urgh   hold the line   raaa  urgh   i'll fuck your women   i'll fuck them all   ahhh   where the fuck are the romans   show the cunts no mercy   uhh   yaaah    ahhh   raaa   romans  forward     where are you going   little late   they'd just get in the way     my own shit would taste better   i cook what they give us  drenis   guts and bones   while glaber and his romans feast on meat   we're the last to eat  the last to share the spoils   but always first to be sent against those barbarian cunts   maybe legatus fucking glaber rolls out of his nice warm tent  and finds his thracian dogs've returned to the wild     uh hum   something to add  little man   a word   which word might that be   the one i gave the romans   and my body and blood with it   we all did  to push the tae back   we can defend our own lands   we gave our word   in my village such a thing still bears meaning   your village   is that why you're here  to defend your village   or maybe you're trying to impress that sweet taste  you're always going on about  with stories of war     struckhe mark near  did i   words and honor  my great fat ass   all comes back 'round to a pair of tits  and a tight little hole   the legatus is here   the legatus needs volunteers  to scout beyond the forward line   you  tactical report by sunrise   or go without rations    please  would have done   we'll finish this discussion later   and if we're dead   then my boot will find your ass in the afterlife       ilithyia   what if i'd been an assassin   i'd be a widow   what's the respectful period of mourning  before i could remarry   you overstep   women are forbidden within the encampment   i was discreet   not you   your man helped wisk me through the sentries   after i threatened to run naked through the camp   screaming he laid his hands  on the wife of the legatus   does your father know you're in thrace   please  he's too busy colluding  with the other corpses in the senate   he thinks i'm still lounging at the villa in capua   far too arid   hasn't rained there since last forever   you should have written   you would have told me not to come   i'm in the middle of a war   i brought you a gift   something to remind you of rome   sestii wine   let me fill up your cup  while you tell me about your little war   too brief a tale   mithridates and his army of greek whores  press the legion in the east by the black sea   here i sit  protecting the northern border     of the land of piss and shit  from simple barbarian raiders   mithridates  victory against him  would have your name on every roman's tongue   cotta leads the assault   he steals your laurels   he's the consul  theft is his privilege   father will be disappointed   he secured this position for you to shine   and here you sit  eclipsed   i'm doing what i can   of course you are  i just  wish you were back home   father's planning a full day  of spectacles and gladiators   it's the talk of capua   i hadn't realized elections were nearing   never too early to campaign   if things were heading better   you could be by his side   if   so serious  bad for the humors   come  you haven't tasted your gift yet       they're breaking camp   frightened little gashes   running away with their cocks between their cheeks   retreat would take them beyond  the mountains to the north   their tores bear west   west   they're swinging around to attack the villages below the pass   our villages   slippery little cunts   they break for the mountain pass here   it will take them four days at most   to reach the villages below   food  supplies  women    all unprotected   it's a simple thing to be turned in the mountains at night   perhaps i should send a roman  to properly assess the situation   send the gods themselves  they'll report the same   dismissed   if we march by midday we can easily     dismissed   the barbarians head west   so it appears   further yet from mithridates and the greeks   and the glory you deserve   return to capua   and my father   how will he measure the man he so blessed with his daughter   a colossus  towering above the enemies of rome   pompous  arrogant  roman boy lover   all but called us liars   how are you certain   you heard at he said    turned in the mountains at night    like he's speaking to children   no  no about the boys  how do you know he favors them   now who's having a laugh   well there is this tickle at the back of my throat   that would be the cock glaber just forced down it   if he wants to send his own men let him   won't change the direction of the getae   glaber is the most dangerous kind of fool   one with a title   truth  but perhaps he has better sense  when it comes to wine    you stole his wine    only borrowed it  plan to piss it all back shortly       up   uh  fuck your mother   the romans sound the call   fuck the romans  and their fucking horns   up drenis  you drunken goat   the legatus has gained his senses   is there any wine left   your belly holds the sum   it may return the balance presently   how far to the mouth of the pass   three days by foot   if we march with meaning   a drink would spur my intent   my village is only a ways further west   my wine is yours after we    west   we march east  to challenge mithridates   did the legatus send his own men to scout the front   how the fuck should i know   they blow their fucking horns  a roman dog barks  and the gods shit on me   welcome to the fucking auxiliary     a word  legatus   move to formation  advance east   surely you mean west  as the getae advance   mithridates and the greeks are of pressing concern   you have aligned yourself with rome   i am its body and voice   we march east to the black sea   fall to formation   fall to formation   no   you would defy an order from your legatus   i gave my word to defend against the getae   not to march east to attack mithridates   you will march where you are commanded   urgh   kill them   urrr  wait  wait   urgghh   haaa   throw  damn you   yah   what have you done  you stupid shit    he did what he had to   break and go your way   west if your lives are there   if not  i could give a fuck   ohh   what of the legatus   leave him in the mud   um  go     no  ah     urghhh       yah     urgh   rrrraa   uh   oh god  oh my god     the village       we have to go  now   they haven't followed   you were right  i never should've left   you had given your word   the fault lies with the romans in breaking theirs   you're hurt   it's nothing  let me see   sura  let me see   your tone is disquieting   you should be used to it by now   i'm all right   of course you are  hold still     it's gone  isn't it   the village   everyone we knew   we'll move south   i had people there once   the getae won't venture that far   not to the risk of thinning their numbers   and the romans   their concern rests mithridates to the east   south it is   i wish i had been a thousand men   you did what you could   you came back  for me   knowing it could mean your life   there is no life without you       my tribune dead  half the auxiliary deserted   now orders recalling me to rome   all from your hand   i own my actions  but my wife     has been condemned to slavery   courtesy of her husband   no  no  no   the shadow of rome is vast   and you  thracian   will die under it         good of you to join us   thought you were dead there for a while   he smells dead  stupid fuck   argh  ahh  easy  easy   you've been out for days     we're at sea   upon the adriatic   bound for capua   sura     your woman   the romans took her   best to forget her then       what if i'd been an assassin     father's in town  he'll be back shortly   how shortly   he's not very happy with you   and his daughter   she missed her husband   but fears his reappearance has come too soon   the games your father presents the people of capua   they begin tomorrow   the feast is tonight   that's to his purpose in town   i would have a word with him   it will take more than one to regain his favor   the senate chamber is full of whispers  over your    early return   cheers of the crowd will still their tongues   cheers  how will you draw them  short of victory   by giving them something few have ever seen   thracian blood  spilled in the arena   when the hearts of the crowd     and the senate will beg to follow   get out of my sight   inbred shit whores   i should sale the lot of you to the mines  out   father's returned  and in a fine state   if he refuses to aid my intentions     he refuses his daughter nothing   when pleaded with teary eye       good citizens of capua  revered guests   a debt of gratitude for partaking in this celebration     of the family name of albinius   albinius  albinius     your attendance honors the memory of my elders   gone too soon from the realm of the living     and the joy of a daughter  yet so full of life   i repay your kindness with gifts of water   carried from rome  where the gods have seen fit to keep the drought at bay   and gifts of blood  to be spilled in the arena     quintus lentulus batiatus   step forward     present your gladiators   in honor of senator albinius  and the people of capua  i give you barca   the beast of carthage     yet his ferocity pales against the titan of the arena   the god of blood and sand   crixus  the undefeated gaul   gratitude to batiatus   and now to marcus decius solonius   and his offerings     in honor of senator albinius  and the people of capua   i give you six of my finest men   behold arkadios  scourge of athens   preening shit eater   a mockery to the profession   a mockery is it   oh  you disagree   let it pass   we're guests of the senator   he's invited us to sit in the puinus tomorrow   as consolation   only two of my men have been retained  to fight in tomorrow's games   while solonius secures half a dozen  of his ill trained simians   that man has fingers in all the proper assholes   he wiggles them and everyone shits gold     gratitude to solonius   but water and games are distant praise  for the city  that has held the name albinius as its own   more is deserved   and the gods have seen fit  to deliver it in the form of my daughter's husband   legatus claudius glaber     newly returned from the savage lands of thrace     more gifts for the people of capua   six thracian jackals   deserters from the war against the barbaric getae   to be executed ad gladium in tomorrow's games     well  um   he is well received   ask favor for him again   and your tears will fall short of notice   right now to more music and drink  um    thracians  between those animals  and solonius' inferior offerings   a mockery  on all accounting   glaber mentions execution   perhaps a word could lend our men to the task   the position has been occupied   good solonius  i was just marveling at your wares   oh and i at yours     oh you flatter   no  i appreciate   good to lay eyes  old friend   i feared for a time you would be excluded   games absent batiatus   a dawn without the sun   ah  crixus and barca  two fine entries   they should provide distraction between  the more important bouts   the senator beckons   if i miss you at the games tomorrow  lucretia     well its unlikely  we've been invited to sit in the pulvinus   the pulvinus  with the senator   a great honor   i'll enjoy your company there   i shall witness his heart on a day   parted from his chest   and i shall grip the knife   i've never beheld such sights   nor will you again             the crowd approves his gifts   as do we all   i've withheld something of note for the last           ready  thracian cunt     yaaaa       the odds seem out of favor   this thracian caused rome a great disservice  father   his cowardice led to mass desertion   is his life not ample repayment   he must be humiliated in example   solonius was kind enough to offer  his services in this act      give the command   crowd  no   ah   uh   gladiator    a mockery   be still         sura's voice  kill them all     yaaa   yaaa    kill    live  live   well this presents some difficulty   the sentence of death holds   but to defy the wishes of the crowd   it's not wise   even for a senator   he gave me grievance  i will not see him freed   a solution  perhaps   if you will entertain  legatus   the thracian shown promise in the arena albeit  against solonius's inferior stock   i have a batch of new recruits arriving tomorrow   if i were to purchase this man in addition  to be trained at my ludus in the gladiatorial arts   why in his condition   i doubt he'll survive to the quarter moon    live  live   we will be merciful  hm   and by such  gain the favor you seek   what name does the man carry   i never cared to ask   the way he fights   like the legend of the thracian king of old     spartacus he was called   people of capua   this man  this spartacus   has proven himself in the arena  for this legatus claudius glaber and i  grant him    life    spartacus   spartacus  spartacus   spartacus  spartacus
