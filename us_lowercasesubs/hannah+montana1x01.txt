 my gosh   the actual scarf you wore on the actual stage   l can't believe it  this is so     l have a lucky bracelet just like that  l loaned it to my best friend yesterday   of course  mine says ''lilly'' on the back   just like that   ta_da   lilly  l know you're upset l didn't tell you   but you cannot just freeze me out like this  please talk to me   l thought we were friends  l thought we told each other everything   but l guess l was wrong  since you kept just about the biggest secret in the world   miley stewart hannah montana   ok  well  other than that  did you enjoy the concert   that's right  l happen to be real tight with hannah montana   hey  hannah  l thought my lady here could use a little souvenir   jackson  get out of here   for you  told you we were tight   l am so out of here   lilly  please  wait   l wanted to tell you   lt's just that l was afraid   afraid of what   l don't know  l thought maybe once you knew  you won't want to be my friend anymore   and you'd like hannah montana more than you like me   that's what you thought  that could never happen  miley  don't you know that   yeah  l do   ok  no more secrets   and to prove it  l'll show you something l've never shown to any other friend   wait till you see this   why am l standing in your closet   because  behind my closet is     my closet   lt's like a dream  a beautiful  beautiful dream   ok  dream's over  l've got to have these   _ wait  there's more  _ another closet   _ what size shoe do you wear  _ l'm a five   l'm a six  but l'll squeeze   wait till amber and ashley find out   _ what  _ well  we have to tell them   here's my cell  take a picture of me in front of hannah montana's clothes   no  no one else can see this stuff   are you crazy  why not   once people know l'm hannah  they won't treat me the same   that's the point  l'm talking mega_popularity here for both of us   think about johnny collins  he'd be yours if he knew     no    how can you be so selfish   lf you were really my best friend you'd want this for me   lf you were my best friend you'd understand why l can't do it   come on  cut me some slack  hannah   ''hannah''  l knew this would happen   did l say ''hannah''  l didn't mean that  lt was a mistake   no  the mistake was trusting you   that girl tonight really dug me  dad  l think it was the guns   hey  lilly  l think things will be a lot better here now that you know our little secret   did you see the way she ignored you   well  l'm sorry  but that is no way to treat a man of your compassion  sensitivity     still no money   l am so mad   and so you're gonna take it out on my ice_cream sundae   _ you want to talk about it  _ no   ok   you had a fight   she left your place   and now you sit and stuff your face   you got the processed sugar blues   stop  that's the worst song you've ever written   she obviously doesn't remember the potty_training song   l like to sing  l like to dance   but l can't do it with poopy in my pants     dad  this is so not funny   everything l was afraid that would happen happened   she found out who l was and now it's ruined everything   you don't know that for sure  mile   things could change  just give it some time   _ group hug  _ gotta go   turn   l don't know  l think it makes me look a little big around the hips   please  let's not blame the dress   _ hey  guys  sorry    _ whoo  doggies   daddy   he's finally cracked   you know what  son  l like it  but l don't think it goes with the shoes   ok  fine  you take your little cracks   but you weren't here and he needed help with the dress and he said he'd pay me   so this is what you get   next time try something with sleeves    and deodorant   lf you got it  flaunt it   which reminds me _ l got a little blue sequined number waiting for me  enjoy   ok  fermine  how much do l owe you   kid works cheap  he did it for   20   daddy  you made him do that   the boy said he needed some money   l thought l might as well get a chuckle out of it   lilly alert   fermine  why don't we step out on the patio and give these girls some privacy   ok  but l'm gonna need some sunscreen  my skin is like a baby's bottom   little too much information  cowboy   ooh  look at me  giddy_up  partner  yippee_ki_yay   giddy_up  yippee_ki_yay   hey  can l talk to you   who  miley or hannah   miley   well  she's not talking to you right now   wait  miley  l'm sorry l called you ''hannah ''  but that was major news  you gotta give me a little time to get used to it   what happens if you can't   what about the next time you get dissed by amber and ashley   are you sure you won't want to tell them   of course l'll want to  but l won't  and you know why  because you're my best friend   and when l was sitting in my room all upset  you're the one l wanted to talk to   not hannah montana   well  l guess l've said everything   so see ya   here l go   headed for the door   after making the best apology l could possibly think of   still hoping she forgives me   halfway there   you are such a drama queen   hugs   l'm so not getting paid enough for this   neither am l   _ we were in the first row  _ and hannah smiled right at us   she really did   big deal  you see this towel  she gave it to me in her dressing room  she really did   yeah  and she gave me this sandwich   you're pathetic   _ lt's true  _ lgnore them  oliver  they're not worth it   wait a minute  he's telling the truth  and she gave lilly something too   _ what are you doing  _ you'll see   _ that's hannah montana's scarf  _ from the concert   yeah  hannah gave it to her   but you know what  you guys are much cooler than me  you should have it   oh  my gosh   hey  l want that   no  stop   _ why did you do that  _ she gave it to me   l think l know  hey
