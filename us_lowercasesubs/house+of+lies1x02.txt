slander   well  it    i don't know if it's the technical       room for interpretation    there's probably text on it   i mean  it's a good question  we can find out   what's another word for cunt

how much of your worth is here   i mean  just how leveraged are you   well  with the divorce and everything   this is pretty much it  really     yeah  i'm all in   well  i just got off the phone with the commissioner's office   and they're about to step in and seize all of it   team  husky dawgs  t shirts     i've been over this with my lawyers   they can't seize all my assets     it'd be great if you could take a really long look   'cause it's happening today  we read the order   you'll actually be barred from the premises   so take one last look around   and after we disclose the 100 million  that you have sitting offshore  you actually will be broke     and we got to disclose   wait a minute  what are you talking about   now  of course  if that money went back into the team     she would get it all in the divorce   i'd rather fucking burn the money than give it  to that bitch  the commissioner   when he asked me if i believed in god   which i thought was a strange question  coming from a basketball commissioner   but then he went on to say  because it would take a miracle  to stop this seizure from going down   so let's give him a miracle   you and bridget are getting back together     are you fucking crazy    hear me out  hear me out     it's a fake onciliation    fake onciliation   we're going to construct a public reconciliation  between the two of you  but  privately  you will  completely remain autonomous  personally  financially   i have already spoken to bridget   she's very savvy  but she's willing   as long as the parameters are airtight   we make the announcement in two hours   your legal department will draw up the temporary contracts   now  i suggest you two figure out something really nice  to say to each other when the satellite trucks show up   i'm pleased to announce that bridget and i  are remaining together       as co owners of the phoenix huskies   we would like to thank the fans       yeah    there it is   drink  drink  drink   tiny bottles  tiny bottles   and    and we can now focus our attention  on the upcoming season       so this job offer      yeah  right   what's up with that  you gonna take it     it's project manager at collins swain  should i   i don't know  it's a nice title   but it's a very second tier firm   what's the money like   double what i'm making   take it   i was seriously considering it   i honestly was  and then something very strange happened   they withdrew the offer   marty     did you kill it    did     did you kill it  marty   jeannie  if you were me  how would you answer that question     honestly  yeah   why would i kill the offer   because i value you and i want you to stay  right   so then why would i drive you away by turning around  and admitting that i killed your more lucrative offer   that doesn't make a lot of sense  does it     that's fucked up  marty    isn't it   the kid is nice  son   just running around killing things   and you can talk to them while you do it   like that  good shot   that's terrible   you should hear what he's saying   take the headset off   couldn't pay me to play that game   is somebody paying you to distract us   i'm out
