sub way fr    present  a new abc family show created by patrick sean smith   transcript    synchro   b b m ni    hi  i'm rusty cartwright  i'm a freshman  college   pretty exciting  huh   tomorrow night  we are gonna host over 1 000 girls for rush   and we're gonna get all types  we're the best   so of course we accept nothing less   now  what can you tell me about ashleigh  just from her appearance   anyone   there are four things that i see right away   one   the stain on the right side of her theory shirt  means she's sloppy   two   her marc jacobs skirt looks  brand new  but is last season  so i'm guessing clearance rack raid   three   her prada shoes  while quite nice  are too big for her feet   probably on loan from a friend with better taste  and more money  four     the bags under her eyes   she's a party girl who's probably still drunk from last night   that's all true   thank you  ladies   speaking of  when talking to rushees  do not discuss drinking  drugs  or sex     what if they ask about it    we have a reputation to uphold   lie   remember  i don't care if she's the lamest  fattest girl in the room   your mission is to make every girl who walks through that door  wanna kill to be your best friend   clear   why don't we break for the day   maybe         we could go to the retirement center   spread some cheer  rack up on our philanthropy hours   i know  i'm like a stand up comedian all of a sudden  right   rush just makes me so rowdy   everyone with an id   fake or real  meet me at dobbler's in exactly one hour   move out   casey  walk with me   oh  you came to play  i'm impressed   frannie  please  this is rush   so  i have some inside scoop   rebecca logan   daughter of our fair state senator  is coming here this fall  and she's rushing  i want her  having a senator's daughter could do so much for us   that's as good as a bush twin   but without the whole    war thing   having a high profile pledge like her puts more alumni money    in the party fund    exactly   the sluts at tri pi have already taken her to canyon lake   so we have to up our game  sell our reputation   and sell the fact that we have a direct line to the hottest guys on campus   from what i hear  she's a little boring  so give her all the help you can   maybe recruit that stud boyfriend of yours  and some of his omega chi brothers   no worries  it's in the bag   and casey   as you know  i am graduating this spring   and i am seriously considering who will be my successor   being president of zeta beta     is the most prestigious honor offered at this college   it tells the world you are the best of the best   it changed my life   you're campus royalty   land rebecca logan     and you could be the heir to my throne      call you later     no  casey  wait  do you know where cal      i'm dale   all right   hey  dale  nice to meet you   a yankee  huh   i guess  i'm from chicago   i didn't realize people still used that word   oh  i didn't mean anything by it   i mean  you gotta be pretty smart  to get in the honors engineering program   how'd you know that   this is the honors engineering floor   you know  it seems kinda weird  puttin'us all in here together   considering how competitive the program can get  but     i mean  you    you don't gotta worry   um  i am not into that stuff  i'm just real  real confident         when it comes to my grades  graduated with a 3 7   got a    2110 on my sats     cool    yeah  yeah   how about you  how'd you do   i    3 9 something and 2280   right  right       are you going to the big department orientation party tonight    a party   college party  yeah  it sounds great   uh    germs   fantastic   okay  here is to the future of madame president   nothing is definite yet  but  this is seriously what i've wanted  since i came to cyprus rhodes   it's huge for me   and now it's yours for the taking   good lord   what the hell is that idiot doing   good thing you won't ever date him   oh wait  you did   you sure are eating a lot of chips  ash   rush starts tomorrow   i gotta go to the bathroom   evenin'   have you no self respect   in my book  you gotta respect yourself a lot  to walk around showing off a package this early before christmas   takes you back  doesn't it   oh  yeah    to those drunken nights at the kappa tau house   having the choice of  seeing you get stoned  or watching old school for the 900th time   don't go getting all nostalgic on me   look  case  the reason i broke up with you is     i dumped you   and the important thing is  we both can love again   hey  crappie   the name's cappie   for that  i truly am sorry   haven't they taught you kappa tau boys how to dress yourselves yet   well  evan  we kappa tau boys spend so much time with our clothes off   we just figured  why bother   your girlfriend and i were just talking about that  actually   that's my cue  always a pleasure   what were you thinking   i was young and naive   call you later  rusty  promise   no  no  wait   oh    my stupid brother   you have a brother   casey   casey   boy in the house   you didn't tell'em you had a brother   rusty  what are you doing here   you wouldn't return my calls  what was i supposed to do   i knew we'd have to figure out this new situation at some point   i accept that you go here now  it's       a given    i'd like to say unavoidable  but that sounds too harsh     inevitable    that's it   you being here is    inevitable   so i thought maybe     i could coordinate a monthly brunch   where we get together  catch up   i'm totally willing to do that   you might not have to   i've decided that i want to rush a fraternity   no     why not    euh     because guys in fraternities are hot   and    they have upper bodies   they don't study engineering   polymer science   see  guys in fraternities would kick your ass  just for saying  polymer science     it's not like i'm saying i want to join your sority   look  i was at an engineering party last night  with my roommate  who i suspect is kinda racist   and we stood around a multipurpose room  talking  about all the theoretical scientific inconsistencies of the matrix     and this is weird for you because      there were robots  casey  robots   look    i wanna have a real college experience     i wanna have fun    you don't know how to have fun   but i can learn  isn't that what college is for   hell  no   you and i   we've always stayed in our respective worlds   i never crashed one of your gay camp sleepovers     wilderness excursions    whatever   my point is     you have your world   and i have mine   but i don't have a world anymore   please   help me   i'm trying to help you   you're not fraternity material   you're just gonna be disappointed   i'm gonna do it  casey     monthly brunches  i'll call you    i will join a fraternity   okay  gather'round  everybody  gather'round   eyes and ears on me   the first house we're gonna be visiting tonight  is lambda

on to those letters of recommendation  until you get to the house of your first choice   letters of recommendation  is he serious   they're not required  more of an unspoken necessity   weed out

you guys play football   oh  i played for a year   in little league   i was all state quarterback for my high school   the university courted me  but i opted out of playing  so i could focus on sports

betas socially   we have an awesome time   we cohost mixers with omega chi   who are the hottest guys on campus   we have formals  date dashes   unbelievable trips   and those don't get too crazy  do they   our reputation on campus is based on our tradition of upholding  the graceful qualities of a fine  honorable woman   good for you  well  it was great meeting you  cassie   sitting this one out   shoulda sat out this whole night   i had no idea it'd be this hard   these guys aren't gonna take me seriously   even these fish are judging me   maybe you shouldn't take it so seriously   it's a fraternity  it's all about fun     so have fun    you having fun  calvin rosenberg   i'm having a blast  look     it doesn't matter what i told those other guys   i'm a omega chi legacy     i'm stuck

of'85   this is my buddy rusty cartwright   he was on the o c   you're casey's little brother     how'd you know    i'm her boyfriend  i'm evan     i didn't know she had a boyfriend    i didn't know she had a brother   not till yesterday   you know  she also didn't tell me you were rushing   well    she wanted it to be fair   no playing favorites   shoot  well  that's what this process is all about   so tell me  rusty  why are you rushing   to join a fraternity   well  i don't know if you're aware of the following statistic   population was in a fraternity   it's not a lot of people   but that 2  represents some of the most influential men in this country   panies are greek   and all but three of the u s  presidents since 1825 were in fraternities   but  i mean  prestige aside  i like the idea of having a group of friends  who share a sense of tradition fostered by an institution  that's over two centuries old   brothers for life  right   that is the best answer i have heard all night   okay  everybody  time's up  one house to go   hey  rusty  you know     when you guys are done  you should swing back by   you know  we'll be hanging out   just    nothing too fancy  having some beers   maybe some girls    for you single gents   wink wink  nudge nudge  but seriously  you should come by     thanks  evan    no problem   okay  here you go  guys   good luck  i'll    i'll see you later   i'm wade matthews  rush chair   so    who here has heard about us   knows our reputation  if you have  please  raise your hand   wonderful  all right  everyone with your hand up   get out   now   all right  you three    come with me   come on   all clear   holy crap   we prefer virgins  welcome to kappa tau   kappa tau   i'm gonna go grab a drink   i'm cappie  president of kappa tau gamma   sorry for all the secrecy   but the hellenic ass clowns don't allow this type of fiesta during rush   so we keep it on the d l  name  home state   i'm rusty cartwright  i'm from illinois   really  do you know casey cartwright   yeah  she's my sister     i didn't know she had a brother    did she not tell anyone about me     how do you know her    uh    in the biblical sense   from church     trade ya    hey  i know this guy   rusty  this is the beaver   like the tv show   the tv    the tv    who sent you   what are you  a narc  come on  there's someone else i want you to meet   hot girl  rusty  rusty  hot girl   okay  now it's real easy   it's salt  shot  lime   s  s  l   yeah  whatever you need  little man   first  we sprinkle a little salt on her tightly toned tummy   we take the shot in this hand  slip the lime into her mouth   right  i can do this   sorry   oh  my god   i'm so sorry  i'm so     what the hell did you do to my girlfriend   i never had tequila before   calm down  calm down  it was an accident     he didn't mean to do it    he spit on my girlfriend's face   but licking salt off her stomach is acceptable     i'm gonna kick your ass    whoa  whoa  whoa     i gotta go    no  no  no  it's okay     the bad man can't hurt you now    no    no  i'm late   it's great meeting you  cappie   it's great meeting you too   i like him  salt me   excuse me   i'm looking for evan   sorry   evan    susan  don't     yes     i'm looking for rusty    it's a little early for visitors   what are you  one of his frat bros   rusty   i'm gonna wait outside   look  i'd like to personally apologize for last night   my actions were    they were simply inexcusable   look  i'd never do anything to hurt casey   i don't know you all that well  evan   but i'd like to give you the benefit of the doubt   that means a lot   you know  i knew you were the type of guy i wanted in my corner   and that is why i'm going to offer you a bid to join the omega chis     really  are you serious    absolutely  you're a smart guy     you know  we'd be lucky to have you    thanks  evan    no problem   so i can trust that    what happened last night   that's just between us brothers  right   you're not gonna tell casey   look     i made a horrible mistake   okay  but     it was one transgression   and it's not gonna happen again  so     i don't see why casey would need to know   take that speech last night   all those presidents   i mean  we are all fallible     yeah  but she's my sister    we could be your brothers   look  consider this a test of loyalty     you're asking me to lie    i'm asking you not to tell her   come on  don't be such a boy scout   it's time to man up   you wanted to join a fraternity  this is what it's all about   and brothers stick together   for life   that's rebecca logan   rebecca  do you remember me   the architecture freak     cassie    casey   isn't it against the rules for you to talk to me and hold me captive  in public restaurant rooms during rush and stuff   and yes  that's why this entire conversation is off the record   i'm aware that you basically have your pick of any sority on campus   but no one wants you more than zeta beta   you could join another sority and be their star   but at zeta beta  you'd be with the best   we have the best parties  the hottest guys   and i am willing to give you  not only a bid  right now  but a bonus offer you can't refuse     what are you offering    anything  you name it  it's yours   i want my own room   done     family vacation homes    we girls share everything   i'm in     are you gonna tell your sister    i have to  don't i   if you do  you can kiss omega chi good bye     well  what other choice do i have    you could forget about  this whole ridiculous fraternity thing   i'm sure your sister is a lovely person   but it doesn't sound like you two are that close anyway   you said so yourself    she wouldn't help you with rush     rusty    yeah  dale   i know that that i may seem like just a christian hick  with a very bright future ahead of him  but     can i give you some advice   sure   these guys   you've known'em for a couple of hours   but she's been your sister for 18 years   she's always gonna be your sister  now     i know that you came here to have fun and join a fraternity   and sin in the eyes of god  but     you could be missing out on creating a relationship with her   at least you're not wandering into the house     that's an improvement    i need to talk to you   is this about brunch  i'm still working on scheduling  all tbd   it's not about brunch   this is about you listening to me for two minutes  can you do that     did you go through rush    casey   what is it   i was at the omega chi house last night     and i saw evan      wait  i don't know if i want to hear this       with another girl      rusty    he was in a private room  and     they were kissing   and  you know  they were gonna     have sex     you misinterpreted    i didn't     then you're lying    casey   have i ever lied to you   are you okay   um    no     i gotta go    wait  casey  talk to me     is there anything i can do    look  i don't need your help  rusty   just go away   i'm sorry   are you okay   uh  yeah  it's    it's nothing   honey     i heard about evan hooking up with rebecca logan   rebecca logan  she was the girl   that whore  god  she's ugly  and     i gave her a bid this morning   did she accept   seriously   sorry  sweetie   have you talked with evan yet   no  i'm too mad   i don't want him to think i'm dumping him out of spite   you're breaking up with him   he cheated on me   with one of our pledges   so she did accept the bid   yes  she accepted the stupid bid   well  all i'm suggesting  is you think about this    i hate to say it  but  but he is evan chambers   his family owns half this state   you two are on your way to becoming  the  couple on campus   when i mentioned you being president someday   i can't lie and say that he didn't factor into that   what it comes down to is   how bad do you want it   i want it  but     think of it like this   you would be giving up everything you worked so hard for because         he slept with someone else   that's not fair   so what do i do    just overlook it  forgive and forget   listen to me   if you want to be powerful   then you have to learn to not let things like this  get in the way of what you want   you do what you need to do to make it right in your mind   that's it    mr  cartwright  you are cordially invited  to attend the bid night party this evening at 8 00 p m  at dobbler's   congratulations  welcome to omega chi delta      rusty  you're a kappa tau  cappie     you up for some competition    you know i suck at pool   ah  that's okay  i'll give you a handicap   sure   i'll break   so what brings you out here tonight   you do remember that i introduced you to this place   i'm just taking a night off from greek life   a night off at my secret place

  a bar fight with evan   you're the size of  like  one of his arms     i was defending your honor    my honor    that's the lamest thing i ever heard  why couldn't you just         stay out of it  he's my boyfriend     it's my business    you mean  was your boyfriend   you're staying with him   you're pathetic   don't judge me   don't you dare judge me   i don't need jiminy cricket sitting on my shoulder  telling me what i should and shouldn't do  that's         why i didn't want you here in the first place   it's simple  case  someone cheats on you   and you dump them   i appreciate your idealism   but you'll learn you left black and white back in high school   it's shades of gray from here on out   doing the right thing isn't always the right thing   especially here     this is my life      your social life   which is my life   what do you want  rusty   do you want me to lose everything that i've worked so hard for  because evan screwed up   do you want me to become a social piranha   pariah   what   i don't    i don't know what you're saying   pariah  social pariah     how did you think it was piranha   no one wants to hang out with a piranha   what the hell's a pariah   i won't judge you   i just want to be part of your life   okay   really   thank you for defending my honor   you're welcome   does your eye hurt   no   do you remember the last person who gave me a black eye   yeah   me   fore   spitter   a fine day for nine holes  wouldn't you say   indeed  cappie  indeed   what brings you to our fair house   i think i'm gonna need a putter  and a screwdriver for this shot  pledge   well  i    i wanted to talk to you   i know i missed the deadline for bid acceptance   but i still want to join   i wanna be a kappa tau   oh  too late  buddy  we've already reached our quota   you were supposed to let us know by last night  look at that   but i was in jail   really  for what   bar fight     anyone good    evan chambers     who started it    he did     who ended it    guess i did   you  uh     hit him with one of these   pledge paddle   would you excuse us  pledge   is that part of the whole hazing thing   calling'em  pledge    no  can't remember his name   so the only person that can overturn a missed deadline  is the president of the fraternity   but aren't you the president   oh  yes i am   and     i've considered your appeal   the course awaits   let's go  pledge   you know  the thing for me is   i don't know how to open up   i hide   so is this the extent of hazing   i wasn't finished opening up  rusty   but to answer your question  no  you have a lot of hell ahead of you   look  cappie  i got my first class tomorrow at 8  00 am     so i probably      you registered for an 8  00 am   oh  wow  you are screwed  man   dad would be so proud   look   evan and i talked a lot about this   and we agreed we don't want things to be awkward between us   now that you're here   you both are gonna be a part of my life   and i really want you to get along   look  case  it's not that evan and i don't get along     it's more the fact that      she wasn't talking to you  dumbass   i think she meant me   right   rusty   i hope you and i can grow to be  if nothing else   great friends   truce   truce   i owe you one   well  then  let's make it official   drink on it  huh   like men   thanks  cappie
