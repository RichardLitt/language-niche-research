here  ollie   to apologize   it was my fault   i wanted to ask you not to blame her   for what   falling under your spell   how could i possibly blame her for doing the same things  that i did   i never meant to     she was my sister   i couldn't be angry  because she was dead   i couldn't grieve because i was so angry   that's what happens when your sister dies  while screwing your boyfriend   we buried an empty coffin     because her body was at the bottom of the ocean  where you left her   it should have been you   i know that it's too late to say this   but i'm sorry   yeah  i'm sorry  too   i'd hoped that you'd rot in hell a whole lot longer  than 5 years   how did you think that was gonna go  tommy   about like that   ok  so we took care of that  good call   now we can make up for lost time   if you're not too sick of fish   i suggest we find some leggy models  and eat sushi all day  what do you say   what're they doing  what the hell   hey     here  son  drink   man  what the hell are you doing    that's all we've got   if anybody's making it out of here   it's gonna be him   i'm so sorry  i thought i'd have more time   i'm not the man you think i am   i didn't build our city   i failed it   and i wasn't the only one   man  mr  queen   mr  queen   did your father survive that accident   i ask the questions  you give me the answers       did he make it to the island   did he tell you anything   yes  he did   what did he tell you  mr  queen   he told me i'm gonna kill you       you're delusional   you're zip cuffed to that chair   not anymore     you killed that man   you don't have to do this   yes  i do   nobody can know my secret     so that's your story  a guy in a green hood  flew in and single handedly took out 3 armed kidnappers   i mean  who is he   why would he do that   i don't know  find him and you can ask   yeah  what about you   you see the hood guy   i saw     just movement   everything blurry  i was kind of out of it   yeah   it's funny  isn't it  one day back   and already somebody's gunning for you   aren't you popular   were you able to identify the men   scrubbed identities  untraceable weapons   these were pros   yeah  well  they probably figured you'd  pay a king's ransom to get your boy back  or a queen's ransom   as it were   after all  a parent would do anything  to keep their child safe   moira  i don't find your tone appropriate  detective   if oliver can think of anything else   he'll be in touch   thank you  gentlemen   for coming     your luck never seems to run out  does it   you are different   not like you

from harm  will outweigh your comfort   do we have an agreement   sir       sir     oliver  voice over  the abduction was unexpected   it forced me to move up my plans   but what i told the police was true   the man in the green hood was there in that warehouse   and he's just beginning     man  the suit alleges that hunt committed  multiple acts of fraud and theft  against the city's underprivileged   laurel lance  an attorney for the city necessary     oliver  voice over  adam hunt     his crimes go deeper than fraud and theft   but he's been able to bully  bribe  or kill anyone  who's gotten into his way   he hasn't met me yet   you remind grell i put him on the bench   i can take him off   i will turn him into a cautionary tale   yes  mr  hunt   and this attorney laurel

guardian angel   by the way  your cute friend's here   you left the party pretty quick last night   even after i made sure the bar was stocked with pinot noir   it wasn't really my scene   i thought maybe you and oliver went mano a mano again   i saw you two head out   there's nothing between oliver and i  not anymore   here i thought the only thing between you and oliver was us   i wouldn't exactly characterize us as an  us   tommy   then what would you call it   a lapse   that's quite a few lapses     your place  my place   my place again   oh  come on  merlyn  we both know that you're
