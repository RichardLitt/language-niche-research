two kids   you're not in a relationship  yet you live with a guy   and you haven't been on a real date in six weeks      no  i am totally fulfilled in my new life    oh   but tell me  rhonda  are there still men out there  and do they still take women on romantic dates to restaurants    and try to take advantage of them    they do  god bless them   oh god  i miss that    look at me  i'm rich   double or nothing says that they're in the dryer   oh hey look  we never really talked about this     but friday is payday  right    uh huh   good   i might need a small advance   interesting fact  before this he actually ran an entire company   look  we lost a billion dollars  but we never lost our pants                i guess you're stuck                            with me                transpict by  sync by yescool    sounds like a date    it is not a date   theo just wants to discuss arts funding for public schools with me  at that really cool new dim sum place where all the couples hang out   oooh  he totally asked you out   can we not be tweenagers about this   he totally did   oh  and he's  like  so cute   so is he giving off any signs  does he seem interested   well  i detected several glances  at selected portions of me   are we talking boyfriend material   the councilwoman has him under review   giggles    girl talk    just business   yes  we were reviewing critical personnel issues   so then girl talk   i think this is great  because let's face it   these days you're not out there hitting the clubs   and nothing's hitting me   so what's your next move with theo   well  i don't want to be unprofessional   i'm lying  i want to be so unprofessional   like   slap me with a lawsuit  unprofessional   oh  he's really adorable   ladies  please  at least wait till i'm out of the room   but i can't just be hitting on the guy when he's lobbying me     isn't that crossing the line    so make him cross it first   let him give you a ride home after the next meeting   then ask him if he wants to come inside   a little chitchat  flash those baby blues  do i have to spell this out   no  i have memories   and a videotape one of my old boyfriends made   man  i looked good in that tape   you should transfer it to digital so you don't lose it   and then encrypt the crap out of it   oooh  gotta go  i have a date   well  not technically  i'm interviewing new interns   oh hey  let me help you with that   no no no  i got it  i got it  it's perfectly balanced  please don't   both  see   all right  i got it  i got it   all right  that is it   i'm all moved in   nice   wall  floor  weight bench   all the comforts of solitary confinement   where do you sleep   this baby  the thing inflates in like 30 seconds   beeps  slow hissing  wow   look at it go   i'd better get out of the way     you're good  burke    seriously  i thought you said you and tiffany  were going halfsies on all your stuff   yeah  this is my    half   oh  so when you divided things equally  you got all the invisible stuff   look  tiffany is going to be on her own for the first time ever   okay  and she's never worked   i just wanted to make sure she was going to be okay   i'm trying to be a standup guy here   you're kinda more of a bent over guy   i'm sorry  look  i just get     you know what  it's none of my business    what   no   say it   i get the feeling that you believe that if you let her keep all the stuff   that she'll change her mind and take you back   please   i got everything i wanted   really   i bet you had a tv   a guy like you probably had a 60      the fact of the matter is you now have 0    that is by choice  okay   she's going to be spending a lot of time at home and she thought  we thought it would be best if she took the tv   like i said  0    you're a nice guy  but you're getting killed here   i'll be back in an hour  because i'm really curious to see what that's gonna look like   i don't believe this  that is hilarious     what    nothing     ha ha ha    oh come on  share   i bought everything you're wearing   okay  so aiden  he thinks he's like a super driver  today after school   he backs his beemer right into the headmaster's mercedes   so they end up having to call aiden's dad in zurich  and he goes  wait wait  wait a minute  there were a lot of big money words there   since when are there headmasters at public schools   they're not  this happened at mcalister   mcalister   you mean mcpreppy mcsnooty academy   the one you're glad to be out of   everybody i know is still there   what about making some new friends  at grant   where you go every day for eight hours or so i'm told   i already have friends   yes  but those friends will give you carpal tunnel   here's a crazy thought  what about making some friends  you can talk to even in a blackout  o m g   i have nothing in common with these people   because you haven't given them a chance  get to know them   then maybe you can get their numbers and text them   i knew you wouldn't get it   burke  you are absolutely right  tiffany's been pushing me around  and i need to stand up for myself and be a man   i'm getting my inches back all of them   we were talking about televisions   lennox  it's a public hearing tonight and there's always a lot of blowhards     so it might go late    uh huh   and flying monkeys might carry me off into the night   you know  i do listen to you   i just don't find much of it very interesting   oh  you do listen to me   oh  you're wearing the special occasion earrings   is there going to be a very special blowhard there tonight   no  i just     yeah  uh huh  what's his name     theo morton    what's he do   he's deputy vice chair on the mayor's commission  of arts curricula and public funding   oooh  a bad boy     i bet he wears suits    he does not   ok  he does   oh my god  i just looked out the window  you guys gotta see what's coming   hey  thanks  buddy   it's the most beautiful thing i've ever seen     joe  can i touch it    no   all right  but go wash your hands first     i think i know what this is    this is a little piece of my dignity   went over to talk to tiffany  best conversation we have had since     since you went broke and then she dumped you   that's a way to cushion it  yeah   anyway  i stated my position   she listened  and i am back with tangible results   yeah  a beautiful big ass tv   watch your language around the television  okay   hey  where are you going with that   let the kid take it for a spin   listen  i have to thank you  it's because of you that i got that tv back   you know it's not staying in the living room   but what's even more significant is what i did not come back with     i'm serious  it's not    my awesome leather club chair   i wanted that too  but tiffany would not let that go     you know what this means    the tv's not staying   no  this means she's not ready to let go   you see  that chair    is me   and tiffany is   still tiffany   but she's sitting on me   okay  so you think that she might want you back  because she's keeping a chair   two plus two   four every time   oh  it looks great   look  i put a lot of thought into the design of the room here   and frat house rec room is not part of the scheme     c'mon  aunt mel  it's high def    and i'm low tolerance     besides it's joe's tv    it's fine   it can live up here   actually downstairs would be so much better   you know  ryder  downstairs would be so much better   no  you can't  this is the first time this house has officially not sucked   wow  it's nice that you don't hold back   ryder  look  i know you like it  but if my interior decorator ever saw this  oh my god  baby penguins   cheepin    sit    no   oh  they're so cute   and crisp   i want a penguin   i couldn't tell how i was doing there   i mean  some of the old guys on the city council are pretty tough   gunderson was just staring at me with this blank  creepy expression the whole time   oh  don't mind him  he died three years ago   okay  then i won't take it personally   do you think we have the votes   well  just because it's you  i called in a few favors   what kind of favors   votey favors  just for you   wow  it looks like we're moving in the right direction   that is the goal   would you like to come in and    come in   cheering  go  baby  whoo     what is this    this is an amazing comeback is what this is   the bengals were down by    now they're even  can you believe this    no  i can't believe this   why don't we take this into the kitchen     who's got

i was this close   then i lost him by two touchdowns     what are you talking about    joe made him watch football   my nanny stole my date   oh man  when i saw you and theo leaving together     i thought  this is it  the drought is over     so did i   but then it all turned to crap in high def   that's it  i gotta explain some rules to joe  what can and cannot happen under my roof   yeah  let him have it hard so you're not snapping at me all day   i never do that  oh  i'm sorry   can you just wait in the car for me     joe    burke   uh  we need to go over a few things   look  if it's about the soy milk  i'm sorry   i threw it out because i thought it went bad   i had no idea that god awful odor was the correct smell     no no no  this is more global    aunt mel  i need to talk to you     in a minute  lennox    no  it'll be really fast  i promise   okay  so i was thinking about what you said about me not making friends  at my new school and not moving on with my life so i've made a decision     i want to go back to my old school    ah   the one that's two hours and  40 000 away   yeah  but they give you lunch     we'll talk about this tonight    yes we will   she has no idea how to read you   and that would be my segue back to you   here's the thing  when i bring a guy home  like for instance last night   it would be unbelievably preferable if there was no sports bar right here     so theo was from work    yes   but you were trying to    yeah     and then he saw the tv    yes  yes  and then no   so therefore no   wow  talk about missing a signal     this to you is an apology    it's not my missed signal   i'm not the one that messed up your night  burke     trust me  that night was going nowhere    ah   ha ha     we were headed somewhere    really   i mean

relationship analysis from a guy who thinks a woman  still loves him because she's keeping his chair   hey  that chair is significant   move on  sit somewhere else   don't get mad at me  all right

show you    really   what are you gonna show me   that this means so much more than your ridiculous little club chair   will you leave my chair out of this  please     we really need to get into work now    gladly     dinner    just a dinner   just a chair   ooh  the press loves somebody tonight    burke eloquent as council approves ts bill    there are like 12 stories up already  and i'm not even

games     this is not a negotiation    sure it is     joe's influence on you is not appreciated    he said you'd say that   yeah  i know   but if mrs  denton lets us do a video  we won't have to write the paper   let's get bailey in our group  she loves to work     hi  lennox and    victoria   hi  you're like famous or something  right   yes  she is city councilwoman mel burke   who represents the

when things are swirling around me  and i really need to clear my head   there's nothing better than going to my own room   oh  room sweet room   wow  i can't believe it     it's finally over   ooh
