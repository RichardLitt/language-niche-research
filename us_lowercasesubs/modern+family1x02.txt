so sorry  i didn't mean it   i just made a mistake   yeah  a big mistake   you're making me look really bad here   i told mom you were ready for this   it's just a scratch  dad   that's not the point  luke    what   i scratched it on my way into the driveway   i'm sorry   so   it's not stolen   no  why   that's good  'cause     there are bad people out there who would steal a bike   those are thieves   you sit there and think about the scratch part  that's not good  either    gonna fix that step   so don't scratch anything while i'm gone   unless it itches    that's different   the good news is  luke has his bike   more good news     i taught some random kid a valuable lesson  by stealing his bike   best news    claire knows nothing   so  i figure i'll just dump the new bike  where i
