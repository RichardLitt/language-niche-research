evidence   agent burke how did you know it was gonna do that    what's it spell      fbi    yeah    fbi    apparently he knew we were coming   you think so copernicus   somebody want to tell me what this is huh anybody   nobody knows what it is great   look at you   how many of you went to harvard   don't raise your hands don't   ah diana look at this   apparently our boy has a sense of humor   what   neal caffrey escaped   what's this   u s  marshals are requesting your help     my help    director thompson asked for you personally   me why would he want me   probably because you're the only one who ever caught him    agent burke   i'm thompson u s  marshals     appreciate the help you were the case agent    yes i was   so you'll agree that this is an unusual situation   why would neal run with three months left on a four year sentence   that's what we're wondering   this is warden haskley   agent burke fbi   you're the guy who dropped the ball   you of all people should know what neal caffrey's capable of   i know i spent three years of my life chasing him and you let him walk out the front door   gentlemen might i remind you that caffrey has a four hour head start   caffrey came out of the e block staff bathroom dressed as a guard     where'd he get the uniform    uniform supply company on the internet   he used a credit card   he used my wife's american express   we're tracing the number in case he uses it again   he won't   hey pretty boy   how did he get the key cards for the gate   we think he restriped a utility card using the record head on that   you should have given him a cd player   he walked out the front door hot wired a maintenance truck in the parking lot   we found it abandoned near the airport   we beefed up security just in case he tries to get out that way   we're not gonna catch caffrey using roadblocks and wanted posters   he shaved his beard just before he escaped   neal doesn't have a beard   the inmates are photographed each morning as they exit their cells   i hardly recognize him   thompson  i think that's the point     this morning    yes   run the series back   stop   that's it   when he stopped shaving   i want to know everything that happened that day   he had a visitor   kate moreau know her   yeah i do     no audio    no   she comes back every week like clockwork   she's not thrilled about this visit   how soon can we get a lip reader in here   i'll save you the trouble    adios neal it's been real   did she come back next week   she never came back   okay let's find kate   i see kate moved out   she leave you a messagein that   the bottle is the message   it's been a while   yeah   a few years give or take   you carrying   you know i don't like guns   they ask me what makes a guy like you pull a boneheaded escape with four months to go   i guess you figured it out   kate says  adios  to you at prison then gets busy with her disappearing act   her trail ends here   but you already know that   i missed her by two days   still    it only took you a month and a half to escape a supermax   damn impressive     all clear subject identified and unarmed    roger that   are we surrounded how many   including my agents and the marshals   all of them i think   what's the message    goodbye     women   they're gonna give you another four years for this you know   i don't care   that's the same suit you were wearing the last time you arrested me   classics never go out of style   you know what this is   no idea   i got it from a case i was supposed to be working on before they yanked me off to find you   you think you'll catch him   don't know   he's good   maybe as good as you   what's it worth if i tell you what this is     is it worth a meeting    what are you talking about   if i tell you what this is right now will you agree to meet me back in prison in one week     just a meeting    okay   it's a security fiber for the new canadian  100 bill   put your hands where i can see them     let's go    one week   got him   what's got the belt and suspender boys all riled up     you    me what'd i do   caffrey was right   that stuff from the bank vault    security fibers for the new canadian 100     i'll be damned    apparently the formulation is still classified   the canadian secret service is very curious to know how you figured it out     this should be fun    you may have started an international incident   how did you know come on peter   it's what i do   how upset were the canadians   oh very   well as upsetas canadians can get   all right so i agreed to a meeting we're meeting   i know why you call him the dutchman     like the ghost ship he disappears whenever you get close   how do you know anything about him   you know my life you don't think i know yours     did you get the birthday cards    nice touch   you've been after the dutchman almost as long as you were after me   i'll help you catch him   really really how    how does that work   you want to be prison pen pals   you can get me out of here   there's case law precedent   i can be released into your custody   nice this is   this is very nice   but you're right   i do know you   and i know the second you're out you'll take off after kate   peter   i am not gonna run   gps tracking anklet   the new ones are tamper proof never been skipped on   there's alwaysa first time   think about it   sorry neal nice try   lights out bobby shut 'em down   neal you got to turn that off   caffrey get one more minute bobby   okay one more minute   is it midnight yet   yeah it's midnight   shut up bitch   you coming to bed tonight   yeah   what's wrong   nothing   oh don't tell me it's neal caffrey   i've been competing with him for three years   he'd be out today   you considering his offer   of course you are or you'd be in bed with me   can he help you find him   neal's smart   you know how much i like smart   is he as smart as those ivy league co eds they throw at you   he's almost as brilliant as the woman i married   ooh good answer   so what's the problem   this is not the way it's supposed to go   you get caught you do your time   there's more to this    more to this than some lost love   some side angle he's playing   so you're suggesting he escapes a maximum security prison   knowing full well that you'd catch him just so he could trick you into letting him out again     it's a working theory    yeah keep working   is it so hard for you to believe a man would do that for the woman he loves   neal just bought himself four more years in prison for what    for what    if you were neal you wouldn't have run for me   let me see it   you understand how this works   yeah i'm being released into the custody of the fbi under your supervision   i let this thing chafe my leg anything i'm missing   yeah if you run and i catch you   which you know i will because i'm  you're back here for good   you're gonna be tempted to look for kate  don't   i told you   the bottle meant  goodbye     then leave it at that   this is a temporary situation   help me catch the dutchman we can make it permanent   where are we headed   your new home   this is neal caffrey my office called

manhattan that i share with a 22 year old art student while we sip espresso   why not   why not   because i'm not supposed to   the amount of work i do equals certain things in the real world   not cappuccino in the clouds   look i will find out where june buys her coffee if it's that important to you     it's not about the coffee    i think it is   no it's not   this is what gets you into trouble   this is the start of those something for nothing schemes that lead to the frauds that got you locked up   i think it's some sort of italian roast   get in the car     okay  who's that    that's diana   diana is my probie     probie    probationary agent   she does everything i don't   she's very good at her job and she can do way better than you   you must be neal caffrey   nice hat     what have we got    his name's tony field   customs flagged him coming in from spain in response to our snow white bolo   customs playing nice   the usual chest pounding   he's in their custody not ours   less paperwork for me what's he carrying   oh you're gonna love this    blanca nieves y los siete enanos     snow white and her seven little men     this is what triggered our alert   what do we know about this guy   says he's a rare book dealer   anything wrong with his paperwork   no he brought in the same books in the same quantity on three previous trips   he declared them each time   all right dino are we wasting our time   they're not limited runs or special editions can't be worth much   so why go to all the trouble of flying them in     good question    he sure is nervous for having all the right paperwork     i want to talk to him    i'll set it up   hey boss i'm grabbing some coffee you want some   yeah anything but decaf   diana i'll take mine straight   neal the coffee shop's outside   you are way out of your league   oh harmless flirting it's like a dance   ah there is no dance   you're not even on her dance card   no dancing for you   um she digs the hat   um she'd rather be wearing the hat   peter burke fbi   fbi   oh they're really kicking it up a notch   so you're a book dealer   yes well as i have told everyone here   repeatedly my business is the import and sale of rare books   how rare can they be you've got 600 of them   would you like me to go to the crime lab   help you dust for fingerprints   i get it 'cause i'm telling you how to do your job   so  snow white    in spanish   snow white was not created by disney detective   there are a few stories that predate  steamboat willie     i'm a federal agent   and you mean folklore of the virginally pure queen   like alexander pushkin's  tale of the white princess and the seven knights    is that what you mean   what are the books for   i'd appreciate it if you didn't talk to my client   constitution and all   were you chasing the ambulance or did they give you a ride   huh you must have thumbed it   no dance huh   not for you   i thought the fbi had a policy   that's the military we don't ask we don't care   where's the customs inspector   neal was right the books aren't worth much   you could pick them up for a few dollars on ebay   hey why didn't you tell me the guy lawyered up   the second he makes that call i can't talk to him   he didn't call anybody   then how did his lawyer know that     i need paramedics in here now   nobody frisked the lawyer    god   we've got a dead book dealer a killer lawyer and a bunch of worthless books   all right come on   as a reformed professional counterfeiter what is the dutchman's interest in these   published 1944 in madrid   this is what he's after   the top sheet   more than that this is a piece of    that's what he wanted    good this is good   he's gonna counterfeit something that was originally printed on paper like that   that's what i would do   tony made three prior shipments with these   two blank pages per bookis 600 sheets   too many for paintings not enough for currency   i bet our deadbook dealer knew   diana where's that wallet   it's right here   this is where he went the daybefore he left for spain    yeah i do remember him   he came by several months ago and then again last week   this is what he came to see   the spanish victory bond   he took several photographs of it   said he was gonna write a book it's a shame he's dead   this bond does have a fascinating history   it's a goya   yes beautiful isn't it   oh look at that   a perfect fit   you're starting to earn your  700 a month   you said it had a fascinating history   quite it was issued during the war     1944    yes   yeah the u s  issued it to support the spanish underground in their battle against the axis   very few have ever been redeemed   there's speculation that entire boxes were captured and many of them are still hidden away in the caves of altamira   whole boxes of these   yeah   boy that would be something wouldn't it   this is the only surviving copy   except it's a forgery   no that's not possible   what are you talking about   it's the ink this is iron gal dyemixed to match period colors but it hasn't dried yet   you can still smell the gum arabic   uh no this has been here since 1952   it's been here less than a week   okay tony makes two trips   the first time he takes a picture of the bond   his second trip in he steals the original and replaces it with this copy   can we confirm that   the timed ink identification test puts the age of the bond at approximately six days which coincides with tony's visit   we're pulling surveillance video to back it up   good so the question is why go to the trouble of making a really nice forgery   on the right kind of paper just to stick it back in the archives   caffrey is the bond still negotiable   it's a zero option so it never expires   what's it worth  1 000 face value   drawing 9  interest   compounded for 64 years    248 000   what he said   quarter of a million not chump change   and he's got 600 sheets of the stuff    150 million   give or take   he'd be a rich man if he could pass them off   but it still doesn't tell us why he would take out the real bond and put in a forgery   i think it does   what if he claimed he found boxes of the original bonds   dragged them out of those caves in spain   yeah how would they be authenticated   they'd be taken to the archives and compared to the original   which he's already switched out with one of his own copies   so of course they're gonna match   oh this is good this is really good   all right let's think about this   it's elizabeth   would you believe me if i said i was pulling upright in front of the house now   you lost track of time it happens   i hope you didn't make dinner   did you forget who you married   i am smarter than that   so how's neal doing satchmo   he met diana   oh a woman who can resist his charms   bet that's taking some getting used to is he helping   we're onto something here el   so i won't wait up   i'm leaving 10 minutes   i promise    i know   bye   chew your food   you sound like your father   big plans for the weekend   uh you know i got to fix the sink catch the game   with elizabeth   yeah yeah she's into it   how cool is that   she likes to watch the giants   even on your anniversary   i see this stuff coming from six months out and then i take it right in the teeth every time   relax man you still have a few days   no this is what happened last year   i said i'd make up for it with something special not just a corner booth at donatella's        and a rompin the sheets     skip the dinner    we've been married a decade   that doesn't cut it anymore   okay romeo let's    let's problem solve   what's she into   sexually   no  no existentially   what makes her feel alive   i'm drawing a blank   how

the best in the world but his own work never took off   he's particularly good at goya restorations   that's what this is peter the bond is him showing off     interesting theory how do you prove it    he signed it   i think we might have noticed a signature tucked in the corner   show him   look at the pants on the spanish peasant   what do you see   it's the initials c  and  h     i don't know that's    that's a stretch   this bond is a masterpiece   if i'd done something this good i would have signed it   the forgeries you caught me on i signed them   where   look at the bank seal under polarized light sometime   hagen is doing a church restoration on third street we can stop by on our way in   fine   meet me in the car     i'm gonna say goodbye to my wife now    yes   it was nice to
