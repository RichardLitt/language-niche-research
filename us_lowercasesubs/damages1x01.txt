i appreciate your offer today   oh  no  no  no  we're fine   we have a lot of good candidates   it's you i'm worried about   say  is  uh    is that your boyfriend   yeah   are you two happy   very   i'm sorry to hear that   excuse me   there won't be room for him and patty   there won't be room for you and patty   with patty hewes  there's only patty   oh  i came here for a favor   could you autograph that for me  please   it'll clear my conscience   you're special  ellen   but that'll only make the fall harder   what are you talking about   your ambition   maybe we need people like patty  who see their destiny in grander terms than the rest of us   but that doesn't mean that you should go work for her   so think about it   my offer's still good   my interview is on wednesday   i haven't even gotten the job yet   you will   once patty meets you  there's no turning back   she'll see what i see   and she'll own you   i've invited you to the show a hundred times before   you've never come  so why now   well  actually  i thought it wasdeal or no deal   i mean  where's the bald guy   he's backstage  we stuffed him in a briefcase   so what's the real story  why now   i'm here because of arthur frobisher   their life savings  as a result of his actions   alleged actions   he was found not guilty at a criminal trial   no  it's a matter of public record   arthur frobisher told his employees  to invest in the company  and then sold his own stock   it's classic pump and dump   he claims he had a prior arrangement with his broker to sell   you believe that   arthur frobisher made hundreds of millions  in personal profit  while his workers lost their pensions  their 401ks   everything they had   government couldn't prove it   greta  i think there's a lot of things our government can't do   we're gonna take a quick break   we'll be right back with high stakes litigator  patty hewes  and we're out     that was great    it's good to meet you finally     nice to meet you    tom  confirmed the client reps for tomorrow   good   wish my girlfriend could've been here   we're huge greta fans   you have a girlfriend   she teaches at your son's school   i thought you were gay   ms  hewes  tell us what we can do   you're our lawyer   we're in the news every day   look at this   frobisher's lawyer called us greedy in thewall street journal   on cnn  he said we're the bloodsuckers   i warned you the media war was coming   well  here it is   i don't want my grandkids hearing these lies   i know  larry  it's deeply upsetting   and frobisher's people are spinning his case  exactly the way we would expect them to   well  what can we do about it   i need you to understand this   we are engaging in a battle  with a man who will stop at nothing  to preserve his fortune   high stakes litigation is a long and painful process   frobisher will destroy us in the press   he will attack us personally   he will try to turn our lives upside down so that we'll want to settle   meanwhile  his attorneys will spin him as the good guy   the aggrieved innocent victim   so we have to be patient   and we have to stay strong   but most of all  we have to all stick together   if we do that   we'll win   okay  enough already     sorry    was i pushing it   no  it's good  i just haven't exercised in  like  three months   the restaurant's killing me   i've never worked so hard in my life   did you hire a staff yet   starting to   would you look over some contracts     yeah    saffron   good girl   oh  nice work   you actually got my sister to break a sweat   yeah  oh  you ass   oh  my god     what is it    they bumped up my interview   ms  hewes  we're ready for your briefing in conference room one   thank you  felicia   i'm sorry  someone helping you   uh  i'm ellen parsons   who   i'm here for  um  to interview   well  good luck to you   ellen   tom shayes   we spoke on the phone     oh  hello    right   right this way   here you go   so  one of the advantages  you know  you're not going to be  buried in paperwork your first year   unlike big firms  patty believes in a team approach   that kind of thing   sorry  tom   that's okay  it's all right   ellen  uncle pete   uncle pete's been with patty longer than any of us   he's really the one who runs everything around here     good to meet you  ellen    nice to meet you   it's dry cleaning   we've been working on the frobisher case 24 7   some of our associates haven't  haven't been able to go home yet   it's best not to go into an interview with patty cold   most likely  she'll grill you on precedents for our current case   but any topic is fair game     constitutional law  torts  contracts   no problem   patty is not looking to see how you handle the facts   she's looking to see how you handle yourself  how you think   how you express yourself   okay  got it   yeah  no  you don't   when it comes to reading people  patty lives and dies by instinct   the woman has the sharpes bullshit meter i've ever seen   and you're at the most difficult step   it's do or die   if you're phony with her for one second   she'll skewer you   good  phony's not my strong suit   good   so we have you sitting down with patty saturday   come again   exact time tbd   we're going to ask that you just leave the whole day available   i thought the interview was today   no  no   we couldn't have you sit down with patty without you meeting me first   but i can't do saturday   work it out   patty's schedule is impossible   my sister's getting married on saturday   all day   you know  you didn't just think that   you actually said it   look  ellen   most people never get this chance   do you want it or not   my dog's on a leash  come on   makes you long for the reasoned justice of the courtroom  don't it   ray  i didn't know you walked your own dog   which one is yours   under the tree  the doberman   yours   he's that mutt over there trying to hump the ridgeback   sorry   hey  you know  i caught you on tv last night   seems foolish to get your clients'hopes up when  the government already spit the bit   federal prosecutors proved nothing against my client   heaven knows  neither will you   i'm at a dog park  ray   you're right  you're right   let's not have this get  pissy like last time   give me a number  patty   mr  frobisher's already lost three years of his life to a government trial   maybe i can talk him into saving himself another three   a jury will give him a number  ray   you in this for your clients or to destroy arthur frobisher   both   you are so full of shit  patty   you know what i like most about you   you have no case   come on  nice seeing you  ray   aunt barb and uncle fran all the way from  california   and  cathy and rich  thank you so much   coming all the way from new jersey   and i want to thank everyone     you know you actually make that dress work   thanks  babe   you okay   yeah  it's     the one day of the year i can't interview   and they won't reschedule   they're hewes   associates   i know  i know   i especially want to thank my sister   ellen   and even though i've got three years on her   ellie's always  been my big sister  you know   always giving me advice  and     i swore to myself i was going to make it through without crying   i love you  carrie   okay  here she goes again   i wish i could have been a better role model  you know  but  you were always  perfect at everything  and     there wasn't ever anything you need me for  so     well  if it isn't the maid of honor   thought you might need a breather   ms  hewes   what are you doing here   i had to meet you   why   because  kiddo  you're the first person stupid enough to turn me down   i'm glad i'm not in your shoes   family toasts  public displays of affection     absolute torture   bourbon   helps take the edge off   i should probably just bite the bullet   so what about you  ellen   do you see a husband in your future   yeah  i guess   i hope so   you know what they say    hope is the thing with feathers     emily dickinson   that bitch will say anything   ms  hewes  i'm sorry i missed our meeting today   no  no  i understand  i understand   the good sister   it's just that this is family  and  if i skipped the wedding for a job interview     you'd confirm their worst fear   which is   they're good  hardworking people  and they're afraid of losing you   wait  how long have you been here   they actually remind me of my family   you love them  you do anything for them   the problem is  they don't have your ambition   what's the problem   you try to lead by example  and they want you to lead   and then they resent you for it   they put you on a pedestal  look up to you   and then blame you for the crick in their necks   oh  that problem   i know how hard you worked to get your shot with me   but you turned it down to be with your family   that's an interesting choice   ms  hewes   is there any way i could still interview   i think it would be a waste of time  ellen   you're hired   i hate to interrupt your morning  art  but it's not good   all right  how much does she want   say again  i can barely hear you   yeah  i'm in the middle of a storm here  ray   how much does she want   she wouldn't give me a number   if she's got a pulse  she's got a price   well  it's one you can't afford   she's on a mission here  and she won't stop till you're strung up  in the public square   all right  you know what   it's time you made the call  ray   we're not there yet  art   i'm sick of this shit  first the government  now this bitch   do you know something   my wife's about to leave me  because of this   my kids are getting harassed at school   this bullshit never ends   make the call   i want some leverage   give me some time  no  time's up   hey  ray  what    you called them  bloodsuckers    what's that about   come on  lighten up on the rhetoric   art     yeah  i can't hear you   look  if you need me  i'm going to be at the brewster trauma center   my idiot brother in law can't drive   i'm going with you  so wait just one second   arthur frobisher's dossier  and his broker  gary genow   what do you know   the government lost because they couldn't link these guys   frobisher claimed he had a preexisting agreement to sell his stock   genow backs him up  but that's a crock   very good  however   frobisher and genow were both in florida the weekend  prior to the sell off   we don't have a case unless we can connect  frobisher with his broker   which the government couldn't do even though both men were in florida   we interviewed every employee  colleague and  golf buddy within 100 miles of arthur frobisher on the day in question   and we managed to piece together frobisher's whereabouts   on saturday  june 19  from 9 00 a  m  to 1 00 p  m    he plays 18 holes in palm beach   we interviewed club members  guests and employees   but no sign of his broker   from 1 00 p  m  to 3 00  he lunches with a few of his fortune 500 pals     lobster bisque  kobe beef   but his broker is nowhere to be found   from 3 00 p  m  to 6 00 p  m    frobisher's at the spa getting a full body treatment   for three hours   what was he getting waxed   in his private jet   arrives at teterboro airport at 9 00 p  m   he's home safe and sound by 10 00   so somehow frobisher and his broker communicated down in florida   but no one saw them together   so they probably used an intermediary  someone played messenger   unfortunately  that could be anyone in the entire state of florida   patty's got all her contacts in the sunshine state looking into it   whatever happened   someone down there must know something   ellen   you've got a 4 00 p  m  at bergdorf's   go to vip services  talk to suzanne   she knows what patty likes   first     your home away from home   free piece of advice   don't    don't make it your own   patty doesn't want family photographs   tchotchkes  knickknacks   and don't bring anything you can't carry out in one trip when she fires you   i'm kidding    sort of   frobisher discovery   patty will need a full summary   she wants to see how you write   her name is ellen parsons     you her lawyer    is she okay   are you her lawyer   no  a friend   you have a current address   yes  certainly   she lives with her fianc    okay  that was insane   there's more   let me grab those   there were  like  five women helping me try on a pair of pants   oh  i'd enjoy that   at one point  i was half naked   and barbara walters walked into the dressing room   that    not so much   they had everything ready to go  pulled in my size   nice   can't wait for a reason to wear it   oh  wait   this isn't mine   no   how did this get in here   i don't know   baby   i hear we're a little behind schedule for the opening   frank     in the restaurant business   a little behind is a lot ahead   we're doing just fine   but you did say you would call before you came   oh  my boss wanted me to check up on his investment   and good news     i was able to push this through   my liquor license   oh  excellent  thank you   hey  there  fella   what's his name   her   saffron   got one myself   most loyal creatures on god's green earth   oh  one more thing   i need your jane hancock     here and here   i think i've already signed one of these   oh  this just clarifies the scope of your  existing confidentiality agreement   i do hate housekeeping   it's standard boilerplate   okay  i'll get my lawyer to take a look   there's some problem   no  no problem  i just     permits are coming through  you're getting everything you need   yeah  absolutely   you guys have been great   good  i'm glad to hear that   i'd hate for anything to hold up your opening   oh  so would i   i'm sorry   i'm going to have to get back to work   by all means   good girl  saffron   you be a good girl  too   my great great grandfather designed this   he grew rich on the munition demands of the civil war   in fact  he started this club over a hundred years ago   i hear you know your way around a rifle  larry   the marines was a long time ago  mr  frobisher   these guns are all that's left of my family's fortune   the depression wiped us out   i didn't know that   yeah   sit down  come on     that's good lemonade  isn't it    yeah   i grew up with nothing   at 17  i walked out of my father's house without a dime   bullheaded and full of pride   it took almost three decades  but i built my company  from the ground up   that company meant everything to me   but what happened to you    to all my employees  is a tragedy   yes  it is   but  larry   patty hewes     she's not the answer   i mean  she's an egomaniac   and she's going to lose   you know why   no  sir   because i didn't do it   i'm a very rich man   i make no apologies for that   but i'm also an innocent man   and i want to come to some reasonable solution to this   what do you want from me   all right  um     i know that you have the employees'ear   that they trust you   i think that you and i together     could end this   now  we'll    we'll be discreet   we'll take care of you when this is all settled  but  all i'm asking for is a number  that you think is fair   that's all   mr  frobisher has a number for you   he wants to settle for  100 million     that's ridiculous    that's total bullshit   but it's our duty to take it to the clients   what if they accept   it's never going to happen   this is patty hewes   watch and learn   arthur frobisher stole your future   he stole financial security  from your children and your children's children   now  this offer    it might pay for today's bills   but you've got to remember there are 5 000 of you   there's going to be nothing left for tomorrow   frobisher wants this case settled  before we can expose the truth   you want the truth   we're broke     exactly     100 million   mrs  hewes  that's a one with a hell of a lot of zeroes   absolutely   but it's what frobisher wants to pay to get rid of you   if you want to send a message to this man   he has to pay a price that he can't afford   frobisher's net worth is upward of two and a half billion dollars   now  100 million sounds like a lot of money  and it is   but it's less than five percent of what this man is worth   i think we have a strong case   i'd like to take it to a jury and let them decide  what mr  arthur frobisher owes you   now  hold on  hold on here  people   we discussed this   and we all agreed if frobisher ever offered   100 million we'd accept it   do you know about this   of course not   it's ridiculous   mrs  hewes  you work the percentage  right     right    more money from  frobisher means more money for you   the rich get richer   you're absolutely right   i have made a lot of money   i'm good at what i do   but it also affords me the luxury to only take cases  that i feel passionately about   and i feel passionately about this case   if we turn this settlement down   the case could drag on for years and we could end up getting nothing   you can survive that    we can't   let's stick to our plan   take this money and get on with our lives   karen  larry  if i may   i just want to say one thing     all due respect  mrs  hewes   i say we end this here and now   on behalf of custodial services   i vote to accept the settlement   i am pleased to present the american bar association's  national public service award  to patricia c  hewes   thank you  george   i'm particularly touched to receive this award from you  and thanks to the aba for your recognition and support   i'm deeply honored and grateful   and all of you for coming out this morning   i have to admit   i wouldn't want to give up my saturday morning to listen to me   so i will     i will try to be brief   look at her   normally  she turns this shit down   she hates awards   then why is she here   for the p r      has just become another tool     most cases you get your clients  100 million   you're a hero   but if frobisher gets off that easy   the whole legal world will know she tanked it   the powerful corrupt the law  when they use it as a club to bludgeon the weak   yes  ma'am  my produce is  and i was trained at the culinary institute  yes   the culinary institute   ma'am  can i     can i give you a call back   hey  sis  what's up   david  where are you   i'm at ellen's   just got off a shift  what's up   we need to talk   there you are   is this the lawyer of the year   is this the man who kidnapped my husband   how's london   london  is that where i am   i've lost track   michael's headmaster called   yeah  i know  we're on for monday morning   i'll have a talk with michael when i get home   another talk's going to help   probably not   any headway with the witness   no   you eating   yeah  more or less   sleeping   phil  stop it  i'm fine   no  you're not   i can hear it in your voice   fly safe  i'll see you tomorrow   bye   the clients want to know to know why patty hasn't accepted the settlement yet   what is she waiting for   i don't know   why the long face   lighten up  i just got a goddamn award   so who's hungry   i'm thinking steak   ellen  do you eat meat   sure   attagirl   tom here's a vegan   only for health reasons   health reasons     right   i know everything about you  don't i  tommy   who's been with me ten years come august   i have   and who did i trust to be my client liaison on this case   you trusted me   but who let me get blindsided by their intentions   how could i have possibly      how could you have possibly  made such a catastrophic screw up   i wish i could answer that   enjoy your tofu  tom  you're fired   are you serious   how about sushi     patty      do you like fish   your clients purposefully misled me   i know a great place     listen to me      no  you listen to me   get out of the car     get out of the car    this is bullshit   get out   oh  jesus   joe  you know the place i'm thinking about   that cute little japanese place   second and what    in the 70s   you're my sister  how do you know arthur frobisher   i catered a function for him and some businessmen   when   a few years ago   then a week after the event  his lawyer called me and told me  frobisher was a huge fan and  that he wanted to help me open a restaurant   katie  why the hell didn't you tell me that you  worked for arthur frobisher   i didn't know anything about him at the time   but then the government tried him and he was all over the news   jesus  katie  you didn't think that you should mention it   by that time  i couldn't tell you   i'd already signed the original confidentiality agreement   and now you've got some guy who's waiting outside     he needs them signed today   oh  okay   i'll bring them right over   what's wrong   so this function you catered   was that in florida   yeah  palm beach  how did you know   katie  this whole case turns on one weekend   and you were there   turns how   somehow frobisher communicated with his broker  down in palm beach   you must have seen something that they didn't want you to see   i never even spoke to frobisher   i just cooked for the guy  what could i possibly know   i'm not sure   the government never contacted you   no   so obviously i thought that their case had absolutely nothing to do with me   i have to tell patty you were down there  she should interview you   she can't   katie signed a confidentiality agreement   a judge can override that   wait  you want me to  be a witness against frobisher   yes  if you know something   he's my investor   he's the only reason i have this  restaurant in the first place   if she goes to patty  she's going to be screwed   she will lose everything  won't she   what should i do   i don't know   shit   andrew  yes  yes  i'm on my way   i'm on my way   i have to go   so are you going to tell patty   hi  i'm here to see ms  hewes   certainly  lucia   esta es la mujer   are you ellen   yeah  i guess   ms  hewes had to go to michael's school   she waits for you   oh  okay   goodbye  ellen   you're staring at me   sorry   what  ellen  speak   you think i shouldn't have fired tom   it's not for me to say   this moron always keeps me waiting   you might as well sit down   is everything all right   he's threatening to expel my son   oh   i'm sorry   do yourself a favor  ellen  don't have kids   i read an interview once with a  nobel prize winner    physicist   genius  married six times   he said   don't have kids     ruins your ambition  keeps you  from what you want in life   he said to have wives instead   you can leave wives   you can't leave your own kids   thanks  i'll keep that in mind   my son came out of me  perfectly healthy    ten fingers   ten toes  everything works   i've managed to keep him alive for 17 years  but  i am not agood mother   i'm sure you are   kids are like clients   they want all of you  all the time   i mean  um  don't get me wrong   i love my son   well  that's the main thing   no   love's nothing  love's easy   they come out of you  you love them   what you do after that is the hard part   you know what i like about you   there's always something going on   i could see it at your sister's wedding   and you don't fall for bullshit   patty knows about katie   you told her   i didn't have to   i mean  think about it   my future sister in law is  a potential witness in the biggest case in patty's career   i mean  that's a pretty big coincidence  isn't it   you think patty hired you just to get to katie   keep your heels dow  megan   so  you want to know if  patty knew about your friend before she hired you   i know i sound paranoid but

her   did she only hire me to deliver her witness   personally  i try not to guess  what patty hewes does or doesn't know   and what about you   me  of course not   today is the first i'm hearing about your friend   you know  patty didn't even know who you were until i briefed her   then she read your resume  met you at the wedding   and in ten years   i've never seen her more excited about somebody's potential   that's the only reason she hired you  ellen   there's no way she     there's no way she knew about your friend   daddy  look at me   yeah  it's looking good  looking good  megan

objective about this     what is that supposed to mean    that you'll score points with patty   i would never do any to hurt katie   then just keep her out of this   did you call the er   yeah

step   what about the settlement   we'll depose katie   if she knows something  we'll get our clients to turn it down   good   i'm glad   ellen   i don't take this for granted   i know how hard it is for you   well  if katie can help the case  then  we're doing the right thing   i'll do everything in my power to protect her   good   i'm worried   i know   but we're in good hands   patty knows what
