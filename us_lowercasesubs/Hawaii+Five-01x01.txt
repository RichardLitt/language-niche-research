the seventh   he taught me everything i know about wearing a badge   looks like you moved on to greener pasture   well  let's just say   the honolulu pd and i had a disagreement  over my job description   but your father understood   he was very good to me after i was let go   he stayed my friend  and i know that cost him something   i only wish there was some way i could pay him back   but now that you're here  maybe you can do something   what do you mean   i hear  the chief of police put a haole  on your father's murder investigation  word is   he's fresh meat from the mainland   which means he has no clue how this island works   no  it's perfect   but i've been on hold so long  i forgot who i was talking to   i need a warrant write up for a surveillance wire  on a suspect in connection to the john mcgarrett murder   suspects name is doran  fred doran   d o r a n   yeah  that's terrific  thank you   hi  daddy   oh    oh   thank you  it was a good hug   who  uh    who's

three   listen  uh   i'm really sorry about your father   but you can't be here right now   this is an active crime scene   doesn't seem that active   i can't share any information with you   hesse wasn't here alone when my father was murdered   someone was sitting at the desk in the study     there was a space clear for a 13 inch laptop  and my father hated computers   i'm gonna ask you again  you got to leave   you got it   and you can leave the box  that is evidence   you know that  i came with this   no  you didn't come with it   i see the dust void it left  right here on the counter  what's in the box   how long you been with the honolulu pd   none of your business  what are you  barbara walters   no  it is my business if you're investigating my father's death   i am  and i'd like to get back  to that  so the sooner you leave   the sooner i can  anything you say   leave the box or get arrested   all right  you gonna call for backup   an ambulance   thank you   don't thank me yet   what are you doing   uh  yeah  governor jameson  please   tell her it's steve mcgarrett  oh  please   commander  governor jameson here   what can i do for you   governor  i'll take the job   well  let's just say i found something  that changed my mind   no  no  no  immediately   i'll transfer to the reserves   and i'll run your task force   wha    what  right now   okay    i  steven j  mcgarrett    do solemnly declare upon my honor and conscience   that i will act at all times   to the best of my ability and knowledge  in a manner befitting an officer of the law    thank you  governor   now it's my crime scene   i swung by your precinct  spoke to your captain   he said you requested a wire  be put on someone named fred doran   tell me about it  come in   this your kid   yeah  that's stunning detective work   you don't actually let her    stay here with you  do you   what are you  uh  nanny 911   so  what do you know about this guy    doran   oh  but surely  you don't need my help  right   enlighten me   he's a suspected arms dealer   two years maui correctional for weapons possession   he's currently a person of interest  in an unrelated homicide   the weapon was never found   so  what's he got to do with my father's case   when i ran a ballistics comparison  to the bullet that killed your dad   i got a hit to the doran investigation   see  i think the first thing  that hesse did when he got on the island  was hook up with doran and get a gun   and maybe doran still knows where he is   so let's go talk to him   whoa  whoa  whoa  excuse me   are you suffering from dementia   this is no longer my case   the captain said you transferred in from new jersey  six months ago  so your eye's still fresh   you know  i appreciate it   but my psych eval's not for six weeks   fold out bed  no ring on your finger   you obviously moved here to be close to your daughter   which means in between visits  all you got  is your job and you take pride in it   that's what i'm looking for  yeah  but you know what   it's guys like you  they think they know how  to do everything better  and that only makes my job harder   you got no choice  detective   governor gave me jurisdiction  i'm making you my partner   we're gonna get along great   that's me    the boy with the broken halo    that's me    that's me    they're never gonna let me be       i take it your marriage didn't end too well   no   it would have had my ex not remarried  and dragged my daughter to this pineapple infested hellhole   you don't like the beach   i don't like the beach   who doesn't like the beach   i like  uh  cities  you know   skyscrapers   no tsunamis  no jellyfish   tell me you can swim   can i swim  you don't know how to swim   i know how    i swim  i swim for

smuggled in four days ago  in a cargo ship from china   with her parents  a couple hundred refugees   she gets here  she's traded to doran   okay  excuse me  i'm sorry   this is typically where you would  uh   say  thank you  for saving your life   you just shot my only lead   are you kidding me   are you kidding me  these are the same guys  that are moving people out of asia   they could've smuggled hesse into hawaii   you just took a stupid risk  okay   understand that   i am not getting myself killed  for your vendetta   i have a daughter  okay   yeah  that girl there is someone's daughter  too   you don't get it  you don't get it   i mean  for somebody who just lost his father   you're pretty dense  what'd you just say   what'd you just say to me  what if she was yours  huh

seemed sensitive to you   huh  i am really happy  that you are not afraid of anything   okay  i'm glad that you have that gi joe  thousand yard stare  from chasing shoe bombers around the world  okay   but in civilized society  we have rules  all right   it is the unspoken glue  that separates us from jackals and hyenas   all right  jackals and hyenas   animal planet  whatever   okay  the point is

start a new life   they drugged her and turned her into a prostitute   the guy we're looking for  is high profile  victor hesse   cia  fbi  interpol  he's on everyone's radar   which means he didn't just land here  and get his passport stamped  he was back channeled in   mm  and you think the same network  that brought this girl to the island smuggled hesse in   well  he made a fortune

export business   so hesse could've used him to get on  or off the island  so let's say this guy's for real   still got no reason to tell us  where hesse is  well  we find some leverage  twist his arm   define leverage  simple bait and trap   wire up an undercover   send him in   only one problem  malihini   that might work well on the mainland   but we're on an island with less than a million

know   there's three ways of looking at it  one     could get myself killed chasing some meth head scumbag   and then what kind of father would i be   i always looked up to my father for that   you know  the sacrifices he made   i'm sure grace is gonna feel the same way   yeah  maybe   either that  or she may think  i'm just a selfish son of a bitch   you know  the truth is  this is all i got  i need this   i want to do what i'm good at   i want to be reminded i'm good at what i do   if that means    having to put up  with your twisted belief that you are never wrong   so be it   so what's
