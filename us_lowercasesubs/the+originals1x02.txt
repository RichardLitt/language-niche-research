my siblings and i are the first vampires  in all of history  the original family   a town called new orleans   now a plot by witches has lured me back   hopping that i will defeat a tyrant   a vampire i created   my brother hopes i will find redemption  through the power of family   a miracle child   part werewolf  part vampire  a hybrid   my sister is doubtful   she thinks i am beyond redemption   despite my brother's best efforts   i have a plan of my own   i will take back my home and claim what was mine   i will be king   the city of new orleans   people of all stripes and flavors  from all over the country come here to party on our streets   some are just looking for fun   some are looking for something a little darker   more dangerous   so we invite them into my home   and we give it to them    then at the stroke of midnight  everything changes   and it's time to feed   this is how i keep my guys happy   the occasional all you can eat buffet   my nightwalkers love it   got them working hard trying to earn  one of these daylight rings   they deserve to blow off a little steam   my daywalkers  the trusted few   they just like to party   it's quite an operation   tell me  what about the victims   seems like a lot of graves to dig   can't kill them all   too many folks go missing  tourism drops   so we heal them with a little vamp blood   erase their memory  send them on their way   no muss  no fuss   i'm impressed   nothing i didn't learn from you back in the day   marcel   what's up  thierry   were killed in a bar  outside of the quarter  nightwalkers   no one saw who   sync   corrections by rafael upd  elijah  if not answering your phone  was part of your clever plan to get me back  to this godforsaken city  then well done   i'm here  and i'm worried   now pick up before i kick in your bloody door   who the hell are you   ahh  you must be the maid   my bags are in the car  get them  will you   hello  not the maid   right  you're that werewolf girl  my brother klaus knocked up   i was expecting to see some kind  of supernatural miracle baby bump   guess you're not showing yet   it's hayley  isn't it   you have your brother's manners   and his temper  too  so watch it   where's elijah   beats me  he's long gone   what do you mean long gone   well  one minute he was here  making epic promises about protecting me  in this predicament that a bottle of scotch  and some bad decisions got me into   he was all poetic about how we're family   and then klaus told he me bailed   guess that's what i get for trusting a vampire   elijah is not just any vampire   and he doesn't break promises   which means niklaus has done something dastardly and klaus like   klaus  get out here and tell me what you've done  with our brother  you narcissistic  back stabbing wanker   enough with all the shouting   little sister  i should have known   i assume the 6 dead vampires were your doing   they were very rude     aah   trying to victimize a poor  innocent girl  just trying to find her way to the quarter   so sorry  were they friends of yours   oh  that's right  you don't have any friends   i do have friends  i have marcel   you remember him  don't you   yes  of course you do   he fancies himself  the king of quarter now   and he has these rules about killing vampires   it will be fun to see what sort of punishment  he comes up with for you   i don't care about marcel or his rules   elijah doesn't welsh on deals   what did you do to him   perhaps he's on holiday  or taking a long autumn nap upstairs   well  go on  take a look around   you remember this house as well as i   i remember everything   i remember how the drunken fool  of a governor hid away all our vampire sins  in exchange for gold   i remember the lavish parties the governor threw  as if to impress you   i remember finding a moment of affection  with the governor's son emil     and i remember that even elijah was happy   your brother  he's gone too far   niklaus  there is no hope for you  is there   are we interrupting   yes   no   dearest elijah   you've only ever wished happiness for me   emil and i are in love   please let me turn him   heh heh heh   rebekah  the governor has graciously agreed  to hide a lot of our    indiscretions   it would not do to turn his only son into one of us   please for me   it's not gonna happen  sister   if we turned every man you dropped your knickers for   then human beings would cease to exist   and we'd have no bloody food   how dare you  sir   you would do well to    aagh   drop him   klaus   klaus  drop him   wait   no   get him out   well  he wasn't good enough for you   no one was ever good enough for me  nik   you made sure of that   now where's elijah   where are you going   it appears the night is not quite over yet   i'm off for another drink with marcel   elijah told me your plan to take apart  marcel's empire piece by piece   i don't remember it involving you two drinking  new orleans dry together   i know you don't have many friends  rebekah   but what some friends do when they get together is they drink   and when they drink  they tell secrets   marcel has somehow found a way to control  the entirety of witches in the quarter   and i aim to uncover the how  so i might take it for myself   finding elijah didn't make my to do list today   oh  and welcome home  little sister   you  wolf girl   i'm gonna search this house inch by inch  until i find what my evil brother has done to my good one   you're helping   the governor had lots of secret rooms   i'll show you his favorite   you think klaus killed him   we can't be killed  silly girl   but that doesn't stop klaus from finding ways  to torture us   he has a set of mystical silver daggers   one in the heart sends us into a deep slumber   klaus gets his jollies from keeping us in a box  until he decides to pull the dagger out   that must be what he's done to elijah   this one's mine   he keeps your coffin on standby   he likes to be prepared for when his family members  inevitably disappoint him   elijah's isn't here   he must have stashed him elsewhere   i feel sick   welcome to the family  love   you should have run the second your realized elijah was gone   yeah  well  the witches have put  some sort of hex on me   as long as i'm carrying this baby   i can't leave new orleans   if i do  they kill me   well  knowing klaus  he's planning a box for you  the second you give birth to whatever's cooking in your tum   i'm leaving as soon as i find elijah   being daggered in a box for decades sucks   trust me   you best find a way to break that hex and run   hello   seriously  marcel   trying to scare me   i had nothing to do with the attack  on your guys last night   sophie deveraux   my brother elijah told me about you   know who i am   yeah  i know   then you know we need to talk   so if i had to guess  knowing klaus' history   elijah has a dagger in his chest   it's a magical object   you're a witch  do a locator spell   locate the dagger  locate elijah   i can't use magic   it's punishable by death   marcel's rules   marcel  what do you think i'm going to do to you  if you don't give me what i want   not much   i've been linked   so anything you do to me   you do to hayley   who   oh  right  the mumsy   well  luckily for you  elijah seems to care about her   otherwise  i'd break your neck right here   how did marcel get so bloody powerful anyway   it wasn't like this when i left 11 years ago   marcel has a way to tell whenever  there's magic done in the quarter   the how isn't relevant   i'll tell you what's not bloody relevant   a coven of witches who can't do magic   here's an idea  move away   we practice ancestral magic   this cemetery is filled with the remains  of our witch ancestors   without access to them  we're powerless   if we run  we're leaving our legacy behind   our home  our family   well  family's overrated   look at me   i'm back in a city that's given me nothing but heartache   looking for a brother who's hell bent  on protecting a baby i don't care about   i find that hard to believe   you're here  aren't you   i'm here for elijah   the instant i find him  i'm gone   he was the one who idiotically believed  this baby would be niklaus' redemption   and now he's missing  probably at the hands of klaus himself   and you were foolish enough to believe  that elijah could convince klaus to go against marcel  when everyone knows that they have a history   klaus sired marcel  i'm aware   you don't understand   marcel is not just some guy  that klaus turned into a vampire   klaus loved him like a son   i was there the day that they met   we were burying emil  the governor's only son   ow  ow   turns out the governor had another son  from a mother that he owned   oww   o what is your name   don't got one   mama wouldn't name me till i turned 10  case the fever took me   then it took her   you're a survivor   and survivors need names   how about marcellus   marcellus   it comes from mars  the god of war   and it means little warrior   perhaps there is hope for our brother after all   klaus saw himself in the boy   he remembered how our father used to beat him   he  too  was the bastard child  of a man who saw him as nothing but a beast   and that is why your plan will fail   all you've done is bring back together two long lost souls   without elijah between them   who knows what they'll do   well  this is a far cry from last night's party   ahh  in pursuit of the bartender from rousseau's  i see   she's a work in progress   and yet here you are  pining over her  when you should be eating her for lunch   well  she must be special   business first  the coroner called   he's got my number in case any dead tourists show up   let me guess  dead tourists with a stamp on their hand  and vampire blood in their veins   it happens  someone takes a drunken tumble  off a balcony or into the mississippi   and today  i've got two of them to deal with   excuse me  love   what's that you're studying   abnormal psychology   abnormal psychology  well     perhaps you could help me diagnose my friend over here   he's been a little bit depressed   can't keep his mind off a girl   he tells me she's a queen fit for a king   i think he should cut his losses and move on   what's your professional opinion   be a nice guy  and maybe the opportunity  will present itself someday   how about tonight   i'll meet you right here   i'll take it under consideration   hmm  harsh   i daresay i've lost my touch   or you've lost yours   oh  hey  hey  wait   we're closed  sorry   i just need one teeny tiny little herb   please   which herb   crushed aconite flower   wolfsbane  that's a poison   looking to kill a wolf   just a little one   give me a minute   cut it with jimson weed  a few drops in some hot tea   that should do it   here   it's an ugly town for wolves   you're doing the right thing   hey  want to gain points   tell marcel there's a werewolf in the quarter   you take me to the nicest places   welcome to the land of the newly dead   i won't waste your time   i trust you filled them in   to be honest  not much in the way of potential here   yeah  well  i just lost  i got wholes to fill   i'll keep this quick   that itch you feel  that's the need to feed  coming on strong   a hunger for human blood   drink it  you're a vampire   don't  you die again  this time for good  right here in a body bag   hey  what are you thinking   cute  dorky girl or gay best friend   dealer's choice   dealer's choice  ok   whoever picks up this coin gets to live forever   the other one dies   damn  girl  i said damn   how could you   get over it  josh  it's not like i had a choice   you would have done the same thing  but you're such a little  measly     let her die in cold storage   got a thing about people who betray their own friends   come on  let's go for a ride   go   attaque au fer  now counter parry   a hit  palpable hit   i'm gonna marry you someday   i would never marry someone who couldn't best me in a duel   another lesson   huh   hyah   rebekah mikaelson   come to teach me another lesson   last time i saw you   royal street was burning  and you all  were fleeing the city from your daddy   thought you were dead   you never looked back to find out   why are you here   elijah  i think klaus has done something to him   stop  stop right there   if there's one thing i've learned about you mikaelsons   it's don't get in the middle of family feuding   doesn't end well   there's nothing going on between us   i swear it on my life   your life means something to me   give me the privilege of honesty   or that will cease to be the case   i like her  and i think it's mutual   but i haven't done anything about it  and i wouldn't  not     and you won't   i love my sister  but she lacks fortune  when it comes to men   they come and go for her   but i am the constant   she's my family   you said i was family   i have begged you to turn me into a vampire   and i told you i will turn you when you're ready   you go near rebekah again  and you never will be   even after all you've achieved   you're still scared of him   i'm not scared of anyone   if i find out you know where elijah is   you needn't fear klaus   i'll kill you myself   nostalgia's a blast and all   but i can't help you   it's nice seeing you  though   good luck finding what you're looking for   i know that face  woman trouble   you're a dick  you know that   why didn't you tell me your sister's back in town   i thought it would be more amusing for you to find out for yourself   is there anything else that i need to know   only that she's grown considerably more insane  in the last century   or maybe that it was her who killed my guys   doubtful  unless that biker bar  is frequented by small town high school quarterbacks   i can't imagine she'd be interested   yeah   just got a tip someone saw a werewolf in bienville park   get a couple nightwalkers to run it down   bring me back its head   well  i guess that solves the mystery  of the murdered riffraff   at least my sister's in the clear   about that  i don't have time  for mikaelson family drama   you're my guest  keep your sister in line   i have a greater chance of draining  the mississippi with a straw   come on  hayley   one upset stomach  and all this stupid drama  is ancient history   dumb moving coming into the quarter   you're coming with me  wolf   i have had it to here with vampires  telling me what to do   aah  ugh   unh   now that is no way to treat a pregnant lady   i do hate bad manners   this is why i told you never to leave the house   werewolves are banned in the quarter   i had a plan  and your little nighttime stroll  put it all in peril   leave him   you've done enough  don't you think   leaving a trail of bodies like  a roadmap to my door   if i hadn't overheard this lot bragging about werewolf heads   everyone here would be screwed   and don't give me that crap about having a plan   you've had all the time in the world  to execute a plan  and no one's seen you  do a damn thing   elijah made a deal to protect your child  so that he could save you from your selfish  rotten self   you obviously don't give a damn  about the child or elijah  because what have you done to honor it   i have done everything   let me spell it out for you  shall i   from the day i arrived  marcel hasn't trusted me   from day one  he's had his vampires  ingest toxic vervain   which as you know  little sister   protects them from my mind control   i needed a spy   someone on the inside with me  who marcel would never suspect   so i created a day zero and got there first   unh   hey   marcel had just lost  thanks to your little murder spree   and he needed new recruits   so i made the new one mine  before he'd had even a drop of vervain   now let's have a little chat  about what you can do for me   but we all know the real way to a man  is through his heart  so     so my mate marcel     nice bloke  don't you think   no   he's charming   sexy  confident  incredibly hot   but let's be honest  he's a bad boy  right  like you   and right now  i only need good in my life   not someone who's     tragically wounded and damaged  by demons he can't escape   the damaged ones  they're not good  at least not for me   i understand  i do   however  give him one chance   then i need you to tell me where he goes  and who he sees   compel him to believe his mates found religion  and moved to utah  so that he can explain to marcel  why he lost 3 more vampires tonight   does anyone have any more questions   no  good because i have a question  hayley   what were you doing in the bloody french quarter  in the first place   answer me   nik  leave her be   you want to know what i was doing   i was buying poison so i could put  your little baby out of its misery   nik   nik   keep your hands off her   she is pregnant for god's sake   all of this bluster about not wanting the child   and then the second she tells you she's ready to get rid of it     it's ok to care   it's ok to want something   that's all elijah was trying to do   all he's ever wanted for you   all we've ever wanted   i gave elijah to marcel   what   marcel was nervous   it was bad enough one original returned to town   but two   his crew was getting antsy   he wanted elijah gone   so i gave him a peace offering   you bartered our brother   i have a plan   gain marcel's trust   dismantle his empire   honor elijah's wish that that baby be born   i am executing that plan the only way i know how   if you don't like it   there's the door   see if i care   i know you don't know me very well  but thanks   i appreciate what you did in there   us girls have got to look out for each other   what is it with you two   i mean  you say you hate him   but the way you deal with him  it's so clear   even when you hate him  you still love him   i guess when you spend a thousand years with someone   deciding to quit them is like  losing a part of yourself   but sometimes  the hate is just so powerful   emil wasn't the only boyfriend  of mine that klaus killed   he did it again and again  every time i found someone to care about   he just kept doing it  until finally i stopped falling in love   he said he was protecting me from my mistakes   that no one was ever good enough for his little sister  until one day someone was   how was the river   it's cool  sweet   i should go inside   my brother will kill you   then i'll die smiling   did i not warn you   klaus  i beg of you   he is not like any other   you saw it in him from the very first day   you saved him   protected him   you raised him   you cannot kill him   you are right   i cannot   ohh   but you  dear sister   need a lesson in what you can  and cannot take from me   if you know marcel has elijah   why don't you just get him back yourself   because if i cross my brother   then there's still a coffin downstairs with my name on it   oh  my god   i found them under your coffin   so if a couple of antique steak knives  were the only thing stopping you from getting elijah back   then here you go   i sent everyone home for the night   i am your humble host   well  ok   extra points for flair   and the night's just started   what made you decide to come   everyone deserves a chance   you lied to me   where's my brother   hello to you  too   cami  rebekah  rebekah  cami   i see you still have a thing for blonds   hey   tell me where elijah is   what the hell is going on   tell me where he is  or i will kill you   no  you won't   perhaps you're right   but i will kill her   let her go   you won  i'll take you to see elijah   ohh  what the hell are you people   shh  it's ok   go home  forget all this   and just know that i will make it up to you   i promise   you want to see elijah   fine  follow me   invite me in   got to ask the lady of the house   davina  come on out  sweetheart   invite her in   come in   i wouldn't do that   who the hell are you   davina   she's an old one  isn't she   yeah  rebekah is an original   which means she can't be killed   she doesn't seem very nice   she can be  but she hasn't been  very nice to me tonight   then i'm afraid it's time for you to leave   aah   well  it's about time   i was bored waiting   but i did so want to see your face   and it is indeed priceless   you bastard   what day is it   sunday   i have been daggered for a whole week   marcel    what have you done to him   it's 1887  rebekah   you've been daggered for 52 years   what   and don't worry about marcel   i presented him with a choice   he could choose to undagger you  and live out the rest of his human days with you   or i could turn him instead   as he's always wanted   in exchange for giving you up   no  he wouldn't do that to me   oh  but he did   welcome back  rebekah   you were out for quite a while   where am i  how did i get here   you upset davina   i'm glad you two finally got to meet   now you know what you're dealing with   is this my old room   oh  it's mine now  just like this town is mine  davina's mine   and elijah's mine until i feel like giving him back   what was once yours  what was once your brother's  it's now mine   and don't ever touch cami again   i didn't use it   you're awake   i could barely sleep all night   this house is like a freaking swamp sauna   what stopped you   you could have been free of all of this   of me   yeah  well  when i was fighting off those vampires   i realized i wasn't just protecting myself   maybe it has to do with the fact that  my birth parents gave me up  and my adoptive parent kicked me out   all i know is push came to shove   and i realized i wouldn't let anyone hurt it   i'm beginning to think we're a lot a like   you and i   we're both castoffs who've learnt to fight  when we're backed into a corner   well  we're backed into a corner now   ah  that we are   it's time to fight     little wolf   this whole thing with marcel   the deal you have with the witches   trying to take him down  take what's his   rebekah told me that you two once loved each other like family   what happened   i made marcel everything that he is   i treated him like a son   and when my father chased me and my family  from new orleans a hundred years ago   we believed marcel was killed   we each mourned him in our own way   yet when i returned  i found not only had he survived   he had thrived   instead of seeking us out   instead of sticking together as one   he made a choice to take everything  my family had built and make it his own   now he is living in our home   he is sleeping in our beds   the letter  m  he stamps everywhere   it's not for  marcel    it's for mikaelson   i want it all back   and if i have to push him out to get it   then that's exactly what i'll do   i'll have somebody see to the air conditioning   you're right  the girl cami  she's the key   marcel likes her  and because of that   i got to see the secret weapon  of his that you've been going on about   well  don't stand on ceremony   what is it   it's not a what  it's a who   a girl  davina   she can't be more than 16   and i have never felt power like that   a witch   she's not just any witch   she's something i've never seen before   something beyond powerful   and now because of you  she has elijah   who knows what she could do to him   where is she   that clever bitch   i don't know   what's wrong   she wiped my memory of the location   marcel possesses a weapon  bigger and more powerful than an original   and you handed our brother to him   how many times will elijah forgive you   how long until his hope for your redemption  finally dies   i did what i had to do   marcel took our home   and our home is worthless  without family   i am finding elijah  whatever it takes   are you going to help me   whatever it takes   i'm sorry about that unpleasantness   she doesn't scare me   none of them do   i didn't think they would  honey   but the thing is   it seems like they're here to stay   they don't belong here   might be kind of tough to convince them of that     which is why i need to ask you for a favor   i'm gonna need you to figure out  how we kill an original   sync   corrections by rafael upd
