handsome but also     a secret agent   that's what i am   and i shouldn't even be saying  that  but you have a certain  thickness about you that i find  very appealing   well  i find your drunkenness  very unappealing   i am drunk or i  wouldn't be talking to you   so if you'll please excuse me    hey  come on   don't be like that   sterling  look out   feltchley   you dirty sassenach   we irishmen will never bow down  before the english crown   ooh  sterling archer   that was totally ninja   il est incroyable  non   yeah  if you're  uh  into that   lana    hmm   hello  hey   what's up  buddy  uh  nothing   oh  dear   good show  archer   you really saved my bacon   hey  come on   you know i'd never let anything  happen to your bacon   i love you  santa claus   what   i do   sync by ee   cyril  we've got big problems   well  it may seem daunting now   but in the long run  the hsa  makes a lot more sense than flex accounts   malory  i don't mean the health plan   unless it covers  wandering eye syndrome   cyril  well  that depends on  if that's a real thing   malory  oh  it's very real   and lana has it  cyril  wait  what   malory  cyril  i know you saw  how she looked at sterling last night   cyril  well  i think she was just shaken up   malory  stirred up  cyril  in the loins   you    you think her loins were stirring   if not frothing   frothing  oh  great  what should i do   we should make you  into someone for whom lana's  loins get equally frothy   and how exactly would we do that   well  she's obviously  attracted to men of danger   like archer  exactly   the perfect field agent   so who better to train you to become one   archer train me to be a field agent   he's already been briefed  but only on the  what    mind you  not the  why    no sense in telling him it's about lana   lana    boy  wait till i tell her about this  no   cyril  under no circumstance is  lana to know about our little   plan  right   i think    oh  but about plans  health plan switchover     i'll take care of whatever that is   you just concentrate on your training   and archer's really okay with us   oh ot at all  which is just gravy   no  i just let mother  think that because i know what  she's up to  vis      vis cyril and  lana and me  and it's not  broadening cyril's horizons  trust me   mother's idea of horizon broadening is a lot of fights  walking home from a lot of jazz tap lessons   i so enjoy our talks  you got them   then they're loaded and ready to go   seriously  krieger  you are my oprah   so obviously  i'm not happy  about this whole arrangement     but your mother is     but i wonder what lana thinks about     oh  naot  need to know  on this   wow   open purse  remove balls   huh   besides  i'm sure it's not the first time you kept a  secret from lana   uh  hello  herpes    you ve la herp    cyrhello  cheryl  it's carol   what  since when  since i h it  legally changed because you  always call me carol   wow  that's    excuse us   what is this herpes business   sorry  bad joke    and a false alarm   lesson one  get used to that   should i be writing this down   no  never leave a paper trail   that's lesson one  so ditch this   hey  that's        my dead mom's pen  jesus   cyril did that   here  this is what a real field agent uses   huh  point's a lot finer than i prefer   that's because it's a hypodermic needle and the  cartridge is full of a deadly  super toxin called poizocaine   here  keep it in here  but be careful   the cap slips off for  like  no reason   oh  you're giving me the  chuck noise  karen carpenter's stunt double   i'm sorry  i thought you were walking backwards   it's all the hsa switchover crap   i'm so over that lame flex account   when does the hsa start   when cyril e files these dd 14s   oh  miss archer's taking care of those   what   cyril's off somewhere with mr  archer   cyril's off what  with whom    i think  somewhere  was the  what  there and   mr  archer  was the  whom   worlds collide  huh   kind of inevitable   really  for a serial workplace dater   oh  yeah   call the kettle black   did she just race card me  or    are you  totally just gay for her   i'm the human resources  director  little miss hostile work environment   she is riddled with herpes  hey   inappropriate workplace topic     and also a deal breaker   lesson one    human intel    shoot   i forgot about the dd 14s   screw 'em  that's mother's headache   you tell me    does it look like i'm allergic   jesus jones  y   so  when i asked for  cucumber slices  which one of  you idiots sent up zucchini    uh  well  that  uh    well  that     that would be jane who did that   scatterbrain jane   i know  she's just a mess   because this is obviously zucchini   oh  like you'd recognize a vegetable that  wasn't wrapped in a monte cristo sandwich   what's that supposed to mean   that is pam   isn't it   okay  so  human intelligence entails     well  there's false flags  dead drops  dropouts   cutouts  active doubles  passive  doubles  dangledoles  the  often underappreciated honeypot   wow  that sounds like a lot to cover   yeah  so we may have  to gloss over almost all of it   weapon   hey  hon  hey  back   what  uh    what's this   well  uh  see  uh  here's the thing   under no circumstance is lana to know  about our little   plan   here's what thing   archer's dd 14    yeah      that we're on our way down to clear up with jane   really  well  you know   scatterbrain jane   and you're cooking dinner later   yes  i am  yeah  yep   spear gun   oh  i can't believe i just did that   yeah  dunce   now jane's a loose end   hey  jane   you getting a snack   keep your story vague   that's lesson one   no  i mean  morality  aside  how do you keep track of all these lies   practice  cyril   lying is  like  95  of what i do   in your job  sure   i got to admit  it was  pretty cool how you handled that spear gun   it was pretty cool   will i geto learn karate   karate  the dane cook of martial arts   no  isis agents use krav maga   krav    we've got an ex mossad guy   he comes in on thursdays   yeah  tuesdays he does a really rigorous spin class   so  will i need sweatpants   cyril  you need all new clothes   well  what's wrong with these   sorry   i was laughing at your clothes   wow  archer  you were right   a tailored suit hangs so much better   that's because woodhouse is a genius   like so many other geniuses  unappreciated in     shut up and hem  you  old fruit   woodhouse  speaking of fruit   sir    oh  sorry  cyril   cyril  check this out  really   don't make it weird   it's your friend   and so's this baby   jeezy petes  it's a chekhov   russian made   25 caliber   when would you use an underwear gun   hopefully never   but say you're in a caribbean bungalow and you're  kind of high   an exotic woman on the bed   now  is she just the high priced  whore you asked for   or is she   an assassin    i don't know   here's room service  who ordered champagne   how should i know  exactly   you're baked  you can't remember   but since when does it take  three huge  surly jamaican guys  to deliver one bottle of  champagne   because they're assassins  too   or maybe one guy's a  new waiter  the second one's  training him  and the third's  from maintenance  finally off  his lazy ass to fix the c   yeah  i guess that could happen   point is  you come out of the john waving this  around  nobody's gonna bug you for a tip   here  it's a gift  thanks   wow  that is slippery   and the safety's off  so be careful   it could go off for  like  no reason   now  what are these pills   oh  just antihistamines    mostly   you just rest  miss archer   we'll take care of these dd 14s for you   damn right you will   idiot   pam  look at this   holy shit snacks   we have snacks   everybody's personal  medical records   oh  no  we can't be looking at this   it's totally confidential   it totally should be   look at this   oh  my god   cyril tried to get his plan to  cover a penis   ensmallment   who'd have thunk it   i bet agent kane thunks it plenty   you bet she does what  i bet she  uh    no  i  got nothing  that's what i thought   you seen cyril  is that lana   wow  happened to you   scatterbrain jane   but let just tell you  okay   you should be thankful you have cyril   for about 12 reasons   well  thank you  malory   but if you don't mind  i'd prefer to keep my personal  affairs out of the office  oh  please   she's had more pens in that  company ink than   aen store   and yet        does not have herpes   deal un breaker   trinette  what's the matter  baby   'fraid you'lcah something   no  it's not that   i've just never been this close to    call girl   it's not an insult  cyril   trinette takes priden her

 you're tangoing  then your  trained field agent eyes spot two threats   but they're not trained   we haven't done this yet   archer  this is how you train them   so you spot your first threat   woodhouse   woodhouse  my knees    archer  bam  bam  bam  bam   you put him down   but just shoot the pad  not woodhouse   cyril  like actually shoot the gun   archer  how else are you gonna learn

 reason to lie to me  so can't  wait to hear what it was   archer  oh  my god   you killed a hooker   cyril  call girl  archer  no  cyril   when they're dead  they're just hookers   god  i said the cap slips off  the poison pen for no reason   didn't i   cyril  but i just assumed that if anything bad happened     archer  no  do not say the  chekhov gun  cyril   that  sir  is a facile argument   woodhouse  and also woefully esoteric   archer  woodhouse   woodhouse  fetching a rug  sir   archer  now he's fetching a rug  happy  cyril    cyril  no  no  i'm not happy   archer  well  guess what  me neither   i mean  big picture  i wouldn't  say i'm a happy person   woodhouse  sir  i have  fetched the rug   archer  plus  now i'm out of a rug   oh  god  i should  never have agreed to this   you and your stupid mother and  her stupid frothing loins   i know you're upset   but if you ever mention my  mother's loins or their  frothiness to me again  i don't  know what i'll do  but it wi  be bad   now let's go bury this dead  hooker   shirt tales   we need a password   hang on a second   how you doing  miss archer   i am good   okay try    okay  try   guest    well  that's just idi   oh  my

you want more   and people think jane's stupid   cheryl  speaking of  it's  probably better   if jane was  the last one to log in   you are a bitch   malory  i am not   why  because i don't want  sterling to end up with a woman  like lana kane   my god  a black     ops field agent   thought she was going in a whole other direction with that   malory  because let me tell you  i was black ops  and that  does not  for a young boy  a  very merry christmas make   woodhouse   ajax a success   tehran is ours  stop   merry xmas from mommy and  uncle kermit  stop    also  uh  be nicer to woodhouse

i just had a flashback  so   these  antihistamines are insane   archer  oh  i'm crazy   cyril  you're the one who killed  a perfectly good hooker   by accident  we    we could explain     to who  cyril  the cops  lana   she'd never forgive me   archer  my life is ruined   and all because mother cooked up this stupid  plan to make you an agent just  to impress lana   ironic  isn't it   i'm not sure that's technically irony  what    this is like o  henry and  alanis morissette had a baby and  named it  this exact situation    no    yes  it is   because a man like you  cyril   doesn't deserve a woman like lana   you butthole   you set this all up just to  drive me and lana apart   well  screw you  archer   hostile work environment  exactly   i'm gonna file a hostile work  environment lawsuit against you  and your mother and isis     what  who the hell is that   your confederates in  operation butthole   nice try  archer  but  cyril figgis ain't buying it   you hear that   i ain't

truth   i don't care if you  have 50 dead hookers in the trunk   you lied to me  did not learn anything   well  you shot a machine gun at me   around you   because my feelings were hurt   why on earth would you lie to me   i just wanted to show you i could be a supcool isis  field agent like archer   but  baby  don't you  know i   like you so much  because you're exactly the  opposite of archer  well  yeah   not to mention your other qualities   oh  you are such a  naughty nellie   he just gets a pass   like milton berle   yup   hey  so  how did you  know where i was   when we first started

but i     oh  shit  my rug
