previously on ugly betty     oh  my god   that nepotistic son of a bitch gives my job to his     his son   who do you work for   i'm your new assistant   he made daniel hire you 'cause he didn't want his son  to be tempted to sleep with his assistants anymore   i'm in love with someone else   gina gambarro   you broke my plasma   i'm very unhappy   it's a setback   but it's just a matter of time   once he's out of the picture   the company will be ours for the taking    great bunny   oh  thank you   my sister gave that to me when i graduated from queens college   one of america's best value colleges   yep  yep  that's the one   it's sort of a good luck charm  seeing as i am doing  what i've always wanted to   magazine publishing   well  kudos  and i certainly applaud your efforts  at personalizing your desk   so    different   so you   marc   i have to go   oh  it was an amazing night for me  too   listen  i gotta get back to work   i will call you very  very soon  okay   all right   no idea who that was   good morning  daniel  can i get you some coffee   actually  i was wondering if you had a chance  to look at  page six  today   no    daniel meade's assistant confirms he was wearing a dior suit   gucci tie and maggini shoes    yeah  that's what you wore  isn't it   the magginis are a problem   but you said that they're the most comfortable shoes you own   no  no  they are  unfortunately there's a whole sweatshop thing with them    cambodian kids  forced labor  i don't know   point is  it's best if people don't know i wear their shoes   okay   listen  betty  the press  people in this business    they have a way of taking the truth  twisting it around   we always got to protect ourselves   twist it around ourselves if we need to   i got it   oh  hey  i got that natalie whitman meeting in a few minutes   wow  she's my favorite  i love those jenna fletcher movies   and her catchphrase   you do the math    you know she gains 30 pounds every single time she does that role   yeah  and apparently she hasn't lost any of it   do you want in on that meeting   me  um  wow   yes  yeah  that's amazing  thank you  daniel   remember  you and me  we're a team   and i will take that coffee now  black  extra sugar  thanks   has wilhelmina slater   mode  creative director   got over her humiliation of being passed over for the boss' son   that's the question on everyone's lips  after the recent regime change when daniel meade   slutty scion of parent company  meade publications   was named new editor in chief   daniel took over after the hot  hot death  of former editor fey sommers in a fiery car crash   the world is still in mourning  after the fur loving fashion martyr lost control of her vehicle  after being chased by angry animal rights activists   you wanted to see me   just checking in   yeah  no  everything's going terrific   first issue goes to press tomorrow   natalie whitman  the star of the jenna fletcher movies   is our featured layout    you do the math    yeah  that's right   good   daniel  i don't need to remind you  of the importance of succeeding here    mode  is a stepping stone for you  but a significant one   you do well  eventually you'll end up sitting where i am   running the company   have you been getting the book   the book   what book are you referring to  exactly    editor in chief for dummies    the book  daniel   the book   the mock up of the entire magazine   each department submits their section throughout the day   photo  style  advertising    all of  mode's  secrets   the person in charge of the magazine takes it home overnight  and gives their notes   the person who controls the book controls the magazine   thank you  edgar   you're very welcome  miss slater   which is why  if you're ever going to succeed here   and  hopefully be sitting where i am someday   you have to control it   the  book is your responsibility   and right here we're going to smooth out all of the chin fat   good  good  tighten that punem   lean out the arm flab   downsize these hips about 15    at least   and this area right over here   my breasts   lift them up a notch   sag begone   it's gonna be great   you are going to look amazing   okay  i didn't think the pictures looked too bad   i thought that i looked   i don't know     normal    yes   natalie  you're absolutely right  you look    normal    wonderfully so   and if this were any other magazine  that would be fine   but  this is  mode    and we are not about normal   we are about    aspirational   so why not  with the help of modern technology   give yourself the opportunity to look as stunning as you possibly could   hmm   you     me    yeah  what do you think   oh  well  i think you look gr    natalie  as editor in chief  i say   why not take something that's hot  and make it super hot   it's a tres good career move   and remember  we're still trying to land you  2 million dollar baby    okay  i guess you guys are the experts   i'll let you do your magic   okay  it's gonna be fabulous   listen  the features people want to finish your interview     print out the finished version  put it in the book   and by the way  why have i yet to see any sort of concept  on that beyonce pyromia spread we talked about   oh  i'll get right to it   i'd love to see that as well   yeah  sure   wilhelmina  do you have a minute   for you  daniel  i have two   i'm editor in chief   i should be receiving the book at the end of each day   well  with all your responsibility  do you really think you have the time   take my advice   focus on the big picture  don't be afraid to delegate   that's what i'm here for   wilhelmina  certain things fall under my purview   the book is one of them   so from now on   i'm going to start reiving the book every night   as you wish   that was strong in there  very editorial   well  the book is my responsibility  it's way too important   you know that scene in the movies when the guy is on the plane   and he's handcuffed to the briefcase   you want to handcuff yourself to the book   no  it's  it's a metaphor   by the way  the next time you find yourself on the spot  like you did in there with natalie   you just gotta kinda go with the vibe in the room   even if i don't agree   if it's the best thing for the magazine  definitely   you know what  i left my p d a  in the conference room   can you grab that for me   sure   has anyone seen my bunny   it's  um  pink     green tummy  graduation cap   no   how dare he embarrass me like that in front of everyone   the tall jar of mayonnaise is clearly making a power play   well  if that's what he wants     what are you thinking   we give him the book   leave the unretouched natalie whitman photos in there   he signs off  it goes to print   enraged publicists  celebrities canceling their layouts    mode  in chaos   and you'll be the only guiding light left to lead the magazine out   uber clever   thank you   ooh  marc  at that arch  ah     hi    hey   oh  those look damn good  hook me up  girl     ooh    i'm a vegan   carnivore here  through and through   so tell me  what exactly were they retouching on ms   you do the math    everything   i never even realized how much they do to these people   the chin  the butt  the hips  the teeth    oh  you don't even know  they ever got their hands on me   i'd look like a pre crack whitney   and i never even got to tell her what i really thought   which was that she looked great the way she was   that's the business we're working in  perfection sells fashion   it's all fake and unattainable  but nobody seems to get it   i get it   really  would you buy a magazine if i was on the cover   yeah   national geographic    i would buy any magazine that you were on the cover of  christina   are you trying to suffocate us with that putrid smell   oh  they're empanadas   they're disgusting   oh  my god   there is nothing here except non caloric space food   and i am starving  can i have one of those  please   yeah  of course  yeah   oh  wow  you know  i might as well eat the whole thing   because they're gonna make me look like nicole richie anyway   so what do you guys think of the latest jenna fletcher movie   and you can be honest  'cause i'm not one of those actresses  with some huge ego   oh  it was really good  i enjoyed it     yeah    yeah  yeah   so how do you guys  put up with working here     funny thing  being on the other side   everyone believing you've perished   we have to assume bradford was behind this  fiery car crash    but where do we get the evidence   we have to find a way to get it out of him   then he goes to jail and we take over the company   simultaneously  we need to get daniel out of  mode    we can't have him waiting in the wings to take over   hopefully i'm making strides in that direction   so  the question is  how do we get to bradford   well  i can't confront him directly  he'll just fire me   then we use daniel   i didn't know you spoke german   i don't   i just own the newspaper   i found something you should be aware of   estate sale for fey sommers   i can never just be rid of this woman   who knew you hated fey sommers that much   who said i hated her   anyway  i was thinking i'd break into the place today  go through   see if there's anything incriminating   i'll do it   i have a key   besides  you don't know what's really incriminating   what's wrong  pumpkin   nothing   oh  wow  the book  i'll give it to him   no  no   this is too important  i'll give it to him directly   here you go   wilhelmina's notes are already inside   she said pay close attention to the fanny pack article   she's not sure we're hitting the emotional arc just yet     thank you    toodles   so wilhelmina's office gave me two tickets to pagliacci at the met   it's boring as all hell  but there is a little alcove on the second floor  where we can do all sorts of naughty things  and never get caught   this can wait till the morning   see you tomorrow  betty   do you need me to do anything else   oh  just keep working   a little overtime  and you can afford invisaligns   hi  this is daniel  leave a message   hey  uh  daniel  it's me   i'm in your office  and i saw that you left the book out   um  i don't know if i should just leave it here     um  or not   um     i mean  i guess i'll just take the book home for safekeeping   and  i'll bring it back tomorrow morning   okay  um    bye   i mean  she was so nice   she sat there and talked to us  like  forever   what was her name again   natalie whitman   never heard of her   hello  from the jenna fletcher movies    you do the math    well  dad  she did have some of your empanadas   and she said they were great   really  bueno  the woman has good taste   here   what's that   it's the mock up for the next issue of  mode      oh  my god    hey  be careful   you have the book   wait  justin  how do you even know what the book is   i saw  prada  like  seven times   so how did you get it   well  my boss was rushing out of the office and he forgot it   and i didn't want to just leave it there  so     hey  look  your name on the masthead   really   well  sort of  they spelled it  betsy  suarez   oh   ay  what a day   no matter how many times i explain it   no one has a freakin' clue what an antioxidant is   look what i found at the door   wow  9 volt batteries   prince charming's really going the extra mile   ay  mama  you gotta be a little bit more forgiving  okay   walter cares for you   well  he should've thought about that before he left me for gina gambarro   listen to me  that poor thing   he didn't stand a chance   that girl is predatory   is that why they call her  gina hyena    exactly   what's this   it's a mock up of the magazine where betty works   it's all nice  but what's the problem with having  some latinas somewhere in here  huh   you gotta give these things a little flava  you know     i'll get some dulce de leche     ew   natalie whitman is still fat   oh  wow   daniel didn't swap out the unretouched photos   he's gonna put her in as she really is   that's awful   justin  that's great   oh  i bet you that's walter   ay  betty  be nice   where the hell's my  4 000   what are you talking about   uh  you broke my flat screen   gina  i did not break your    listen  you barged into my house  like a little mexican banshee and slammed my door   thing smashed right on the floor 'cause of you   well  maybe if you stayed away from what wasn't yours     oh  are you still hung up over that   look  i want my money or a comparably priced 50 inch plasma installed   bitch  out my house     oh  no  you did not just call me a      oh  yes  i did   please be careful with the book   gina  leave

my nights  than break into people's homes   gina   justin  put your headphones on   that bitch   oh  my god   if that showerhead could pay my bills  i would marry it     hey  uh  daniel  it's me      we're gonna be late   not that late   do you like it when i bite your ear     damn it    oh  i guess not     i gotta call betty    okay  buzz kill   she took the book home to her house last night   to queens  ew   hello   yeah  this is daniel meade for betty   i have to tell him what happened   justin  headphones   you do not tell this man the truth   you lie  we will get that book back   i promise you   hi  daniel   i just got your message  you took the book home   yeah  um  i didn't know where to leave it   betty  you're an assistant   you never  ever take that book out of the office   what

uh  betty  i know it was an honest mistake   you have it  it's safe   that   so that's all that's important   yeah  um    it's totally safe   um     i'm looking at the layout of natalie whitman right now   um  and by the way  i think it's very brave and impressive  that you used the original photos   what original photos   you know  the  the unretouched pictures of natalie   i never approved that   wait  are there unretouched photos in that book     yeah  i thought you had approved them    this isn't happening   look  if those   if those photos ever got out  it would be disastrous  betty   okay  betty  do not let that book out of your sight   i'm sending a car over to pick you up right now   okay  okay   yeah  i'm  i'm  i'm holding it   bye   i am in big trouble   what    hilda just told me that gina gambarro stole your book   give me the phone  i'm calling her parents   dad  i'm not 6   she's right  i'll handle this   i'm gonna show that skank a whole new use for her curling iron

grand so i can get a new tv   and you get your book back   i don't have  4 000   then i probably won't take a check   gina  this is my job   you cannot do this to me   oh  look at that  i accidentally tore a page   no  no  no  no  don't  you don't do that  don't do that  gina   maybe you learned a little lesson here   no one screws with gina gambarro   then maybe you've learned a little lesson   gina gambarro should always latch her back door   get out of my house   i will call the police so fast   this is trespassing   oh  what do you call breaking into our house last night   look  she replaces my tv  and she gets her stupid book back   okay  i am only gonna ask you one time   where is it   i don't seem to remember   well  maybe pulling that weave out of your head will jog your memory   it's right here   hilda  just stop  stop   the car's here  it's no use   look  i just  i need to go to the office and deal with this   you are paying for this   well  i guess we owe you  4 000     and fifty cents   hold the elevator   hold it   that was close   you get a chance to look over the book yet   you know  we really can't proceed until you sign off   and we do go to press by 6 00 tonight   i was  uh  just getting my notes together   i'll be ready for our meeting at 10 00   what did you think overall   looks    pretty good     except for the unretouched photos of natalie whitman   unretouched photos   yes  somehow they made it into the mock up   lucky i caught that  huh   could have been a big one   actually surprised you missed it     well  i     don't sweat it   you're probably just reaching that age where you have  to start worrying about glasses   happens to everyone   love  you're gonna have to slow down   i can't understand what you're saying   now what exactly is a gina gambarro   my neighbor  she's the one who has the book   and she's holding it ransom   the book   the book with the unretouched photographs of natalie     oh  dear    this is bad  isn't it   uh  well  i wouldn't count on  employee of the month    oh  my god   what   christina  everything up until this point has been a big lie   i didn't get the job because i was qualified   i got the job because bradford meade didn't want his son  to be tempted to sleep with his assistant   and you have more than proven yourself   it doesn't matter   i keep getting told that i have to twist the truth to fit in   and maybe i just don't belong at  mode    and my bunny is paying the price for it   your bunny   listen  sweetheart  there's an awful lot of information  coming out of your mouth right now  and to be honest   i can't really make any sense of it   look  i just need to come clean to daniel   tell him the truth   well  the truth might get you fired   well  i need to do it   bye  christina   there's hardly any traffic on the bridge  miss   we should be there in no time   great   this must be my lucky day   this must be my lucky day   vampira told me to let you know they're still waiting  on your notes from the book   uh  uh  just tell them i'm  i'm still going over it   i  uh  i ran out of post its  okay  yeah   oh  and  uh  call betty again  find out where the hell she    okay  i'm no seeing the book in your hands   why is that   because gina gambarro has it   gambarro  gambarro  is that a a new designer   no  it's an old slut   she broke into my house  and she took it  and now she's holding it ransom    what  w w wait  you told me you had the book     you said you were looking at it    yeah  i lied     or i twisted the truth to try to buy some time and fix it   betty  you don't lie to me  ever  we're on the same team   i mean  we cannot afford to have those unretouched natalie proofs  out there in any way  shape or form   and i i cannot tell you how royally screwed  she and this entire magazine could be   because there's pictures of what she actually looks like   exactly   how much does this gina want    4 000   daniel  i i will pay you back with interest   or you can take it out of my check for the next five years   i'm so sorry   okay  stop  uh    we're gonna deal with this later   get my checkbook out of my top drawer and meet me downstairs   we're going to queens   daniel  they're all waiting for you   oh  right   well  it looks like our 10 00 meeting is finally beginning   we're all very excited to hear your thoughts on the book  daniel   where is the book  anyway   oh  uh  it's back there in my office   i see it   well  don't you need it to go through your notes with us   uh  actually  i just came in to tell you all  i i think you did a great job on this issue   and i don't really have any notes  so     well  i do  you mind if i get it back so i can go through mine   you want the book back   if it's not a problem   actually  um  i might want to take one more look at it   just to make sure everything is perfect  you know   so why don't we meet back here  in say  three hours   it's great to see everyone  jeff  how's the wife   we're separating   great to hear it   our fearless leader   that's it   who put the bunny in the toilet   this is not funny   who thinks this is funny   oh  really   well  whoever's doing this   if you think you can break me that easily  you're wrong   you can take my bunny     but you can't take my spirit   hello there   you have something that belongs to me   oh  you   i want that book   i have your money   well     what are you doing here   i'm working   what are you doing here   where did you get the tv   you guys are a little late   someone else found out about the book   who knew this thing was like the freakin' dead sea scrolls   anyway  they came by earlier  and gave me enough money for a new flat screen   l c d    even better than plasma   oh  my god   someone else has the book    mets cap  big sunglasses  knew all about the book     of course  if i had known it was you  i would have held out   i swear this is purely a professional visit   there's nothing between us anymore  we're not even friends   i don't even like her   walter  i don't care     you don't    no     did you get my gift    the batteries  yeah  thanks   they'll really come in handy during hurricane season   no  don't you remember when we first started dating   and you stopped by pro buy   i was doing shipping and receiving   a box of 9 volts   first time we kissed  you said   careful      careful  we're gonna 'cause a spark    yeah   hey there   whassup   we need to talk   we need to figure out who did this  how they found out  and stop them before it's too late   i know    i'm so sorry     rumors are flying around town that horrifying   unretouched photographs of natalie whitman    still carrying her jenna fletcher weight like an albatross    have been lost by  mode  magazine   now if and when they turn up   we will immediately broadcast them right here on  fashion tv    remember   we only make others feel bad to make you feel good   i have no idea how this happened   the book was not in my possession at the time   absolutely  i understand the severity of this   though i think it'll just be daniel at the meeting   he is  after all  the editor in chief  and the man in charge   yes   how was queens   like the lost city of hoochieville   this gina gambarro didn't miss a beat   jumped right for the money   poor unemployed thing just couldn't bear  missing another episode of tyra   good work  darling   so you're leaking the pictures   ah  of course not   just the rumor that they're there   there'll be a great deal of sweating and hand wringing   bradford will realize once and for all what a dolt his son is   and we swoop in with the missing proofs and make ourselves     i'm sorry     make you the hero   where to  mr  meade   can you just drive around for a little bit   you know  i could say i was mugged   i could get my golf club  you could hit me across the face   break my nose   daniel  there are a lot of things i'm willing to do for this job   that is not one of them   plus  how are you gonna explain being in queens  anyway   betty  my father could fire me over this   maybe i should just have them take me to j f k    get a one way ticket to paris  no  rio   it's cheaper  women are much hotter     i could get a little place in ipanema   and then what   i don't know  drink  party   as long as i escape the pressure of ting to be something i am clearly not   daniel  if i can suggest     instead of trying to escape this or spin it   why don't you just tell the truth   or you can just blame me   i don't mind being your fall girl  guy  person   whatever   if you could just twist the truth one last time  and give me a good recommendation  i'd really appreciate it   driver  take us back to the meade building   this is an atrocity   i don't  i don't even know how to spin this   this is bad  this is mel gibson bad   we are so incredibly sorry   you know   sorry  is not gonna cut it   if those pictures appear on the internet  on television   our p r  firm will never allow any of our clients anywhere near your magazine   how did this happen   well  it's um    it's complicated   they were in my office's possession at the time   what do you intend to do about it   well  we have people out there searching   we're making phone calls   we're doing everything we possibly can   what does  what does that mean    will you put a sock in it already   what's he gonna do  dispatch a commando unit for pictures   just calm down   just trying to protect you   then come up with a solution   i am trying to come up with a solution   do you know how this could hurt your career if these pictures got out there   no one wants to hire a fatty   what's this gonna publicize  the fact that you can't lose any weight   you know how in those samurai movies they'd rather kill themselves  than be captured or defeated   ritual suicide   it's called seppuku   like the beer   anyway  this whole situation  with you taking the book to queens reminded me of that   and i figured  rather than live with the shame of the screwup  and probably end up getting fired anyway   wouldn't you rather just quit   se pu ku  betty     you know what    hmm   you really do belong here more than i do   and i truly hope that you get everything you deserve   oh  thank you   bye   can you hold the elevator  please   hey  empanada girl   betty  right   yeah   god  what happened to that bunny   it looks like it was stuck in a blender   it probably was   it's had a tough couple of days   so you moving offices   actually  um     i'm quitting
