    i'll be available to you 24 7   do you believe in love at first sight   i know what you're thinking   the world is a cynical place and i must be a cynical man        thinking a woman like you

comfortable  we won't be here long   mr  holmes  did your father tell you about me or not   well    he emailed   said to expect some sort of addict sitter  then he explained his conditions with respect to your sobriety   if you mean his threats to evict me from this  the shoddiest and the least renovated from the 5    count them  5 properties he owns in new york  then  yeah   and yeah he made his conditions quite clear   i use  i wind up on the street   i refuse your quote unquote help  i wind up on the street  it's my understanding that most sober companions are recovering addicts themselves  but      you've never had a problem with drugs or alcohol     your father told you    of course he didn't   care to explain why you broke out of your rehab facility the same day you're being released   bored   you were bored   no  i am bored right now   happens often  you'll get used to it   regarding our mutual friends at hendale     i say they should be thanking me for  exposing flaws in their rubbish security system  excellent   there was a women leaving  just as i got here     did she get you high   about six feet   full disclosure       i actually find sex repellent   all those fluids and odd sounds   but my brain and my body require it  to function at optimum levels  so     i feed them as needed   you're a doctor  you understand   i'm not a doctor   you were a doctor  surgeon  judging by your hands   is your car parked nearby   yes  it's just out there   how did you know i had a car   the parking ticket  fell out  of your purse when you dropped it   can't have one without the other  can you   we're late  we need to get going   err     late for what   actually  scratch the car  manhattan bridge  is down to a single lane   we'll take the tube instead   look at this place    yuck   i can't wait for you to tidy it   prior to my stint in junkie jail   i worked as a consultant at scotland yard   your father told me  he said you were a detective   i was a consultant   i wasn't paid for my services  therefore i answered to no one but myself   what about london   what about it   he told me that's where you bottomed out  he thinks something happened to you there  he just doesn't know what   handsome woman  your mother   it's very big of her to take your dad back after the affair   how could you possibly      you still haven't told me where we're going yet   about that     i think you and father will be pleased to hear  i have devised a post rehab regimen for myself  that will keep me quite busy   i've decided to resume  my work as a consultant here  in new york   tell me        how do clients typically introduce    what do you mean   i mean  i find it hard to believe they'd actually tell someone they'd been assigned a glorified helper monkey   helper monkey   well you and i have what's known as  companion client confidentiality   which means that you can introduce me however you like   friend  coworker  relative  and i'll play along   but  to be honest  most clients just call me  their companion   captain gregson     holmes     how are you doing    this is captain gregson  captain gregson  this is miss watson my personal valet   how do you do   she waits out here   i'm afraid she's quite crucial  to my process  captain   it's okay  really   actually it isn't   at least not according to my father's email   where he explained it's the job of a proper    valet  to accompany his or her charge to their place of business   well  consider this  my place of business   and today every wretched hive of depravity and murder in this city   my place of business   unless  of course  you don't think you have the stomach for the work i do   i'm good   you put these gloves on  please   dr  richard mantlo came home a few hours ago to find his door kicked in   and his wife   amy damper  missing     that's    that's mantlo over there   he's the head shrink out at sanbridge hospital  says he caught an emergency last night  didn't get home until 5 am   saw the front door   called 911   first officers on the scene found sign of a struggle  in the kitchen and in the master bedroom   but    no mrs  damper   ransom demand   what is it   ah not sure      mrs  damper's cell phone  have you recovered it   we have her cellphone   thank you detective   hmm    she either lost a tremendous amount of weight or underwent      significant plastic surgery sometime in the last two years   she looks the same in all the photos   that's my point   ovular frames     are older  have been here longer  you can tell by the way the wall has faded  the square frame's newer   they're the only ones that feature mrs  damper   coincidence   no  check her cellphone   no photos of her older than two years  yet there are  countless pictures of other people     as many as five years ago   i take it you two have worked together before   about ten years ago      a few months after 9 11  i was assigned to scotland yard  to observe their  counter terrorism bureau   holmes mostly worked homicides  but     our paths still crossed a few times   captain  if you please   yeah   miss damper knew her attacker  she let him into the house herself   captain  who is this guy   there are two broken glasses here  you can tell from the volume of shards   obviously  she was pouring a glass of water for her guest   when he assailed her   right  because that is something you would do   if some nutjob comes in and kicks your door in   you ask him if he's thirsty   ok   thanks   base of glass number      two   if you take another glance  at the boot print on the front door  you'll see an almost imperceptible spot of blood   where the heel made contact   lab tests  i'm certain  will conclude it's the victim's blood   and can only have been left there after the assault had already taken place   mrs  damper let the man in  because he was familiar to her   he kicked the door in as he exited to try to obscure this fact   also  he took something  from the living room   note the symmetry of the space   this wall is very nearly  a reflection of that one   pictures  pictures  knickknacks  knickknacks   i see balance everywhere   except     this one space   something was here  what was it     i'm sorry    maybe this isn't the best time   no  no  please concentrate  something used to occupy that space  i need you to tell me what it was   it was an old ring box  amy's grandmother gave it to her   why   you said there were also signs of a struggle in the master bedroom   what is it   why is it so important  the kidnapper took a ring box   kidnappers don't take trophies  killers do   there's no body  genius   there's no blood on the front stoop or walk either   it's rather difficult not to leave any  when you're abducting someone with  an arterial wound  wouldn't you agree   you're certain your men have been  over every inch of this house   of course   as you can see  there was      a struggle here   she's in the safe room   what safe room   the one behind that wall   the husband didn't say anything  about any safe room   there's a slight angle to the floor   you can     the extra weight of a safe room's steel reinforcements  can cause the floor around it  to decline slightly  creating     a slope between one and five degrees   sometimes i hate it  when i'm right   for the last time     i loved my wife   i didn't hurt her and before this moment   i had no idea there was  any safe room in my house   you get why that's hard for us to believe  don't you   the place was gutted  before amy and i moved in two years ago   she oversaw all the construction   i'm sorry  but     are you saying she had it installed  but never told you   you don't look well  miss watson   perhaps you should go home   how do you do it   do what   guess things   i don't guess   i observe   and once i've observed  i deduce   you said you could tell from my hands  that i used to be a surgeon  hand  singular  actually   soft  without calluses   also it smells faintly of beeswax   many surgeons  as you know  use a beeswax cream  to protect their hands from the dehydrating effects of repeated brushings   you're no longer practicing  but old habits die hard  thus  why you gave up a medical career to become a companion  unless addictions took the life of someone close to you   and his or her death move you to make drastic changes in your life   am i close   what about my father   what about him   how did you know he had an affair   google   well  not everything is deducible   i just wanted to say thanks for helping out today   you    you got us our guy and        and we're grateful   we can take it from here   respectfully detective  i doubt that very much   'cause i've reason to believe that richard mantlo didn't kill his wife   wait  wait     e again   dr  mantlo has girl's feet  haven't you noticed  is a size 8   the boot print on the front door was an 11   so  so he was smart  he wore bigger shoes to throw us off   did he also wear bigger hands  when he strangled his wife     holmes      the strangulation marks        are indicative of a man much larger than mantlo   not just heavier  but taller   an estimated high would be someone between 6'1  6'3     your medical examiner will come to the same conclusion in a couple of hours   i'm delivering it to you now  you're doctor  tell them i'm right     i'm not a doctor    were  a doctor   for sure you haven't forgotten how bruising works   ok  yeah  sure    these hands seem too small for that          for that bruise patterns  but      with your permission  captain   i'd like a moment alone with dr  mantlo     captain  this      you got two minutes   tall men in your life   i'd like a list   from the six names that dr  mantlo gave   only two have ever been in any troubles with the police   one is a contractor  the only one that  seen the drawings for the renovation   joseph de santo   string of unpaid park tickets   the second is harrison polk   the administrator of the cambridge hospital  was accused of stalking a neighbor  two years ago   the charges were eventually dropped  but still     you've got all that from your phone   i logged into the police system with captain gregson account   tooks seven tries to deduce his password   so  administalker     seems like the best place to start   what do you mean   i mean that we should talk to him first     and then the other five     the police still think that mantlo is their guy   the police think a lot of things   it's adorable   i'm confused   i thought agreed with me about the hands      it was a photograph   i mean  i think you're right  but to know for sure i'd have to examine the bruise patterns on body myself   fine  i'll arrange it  after we've spoken to the suspects   amy was a good person  but if you're here because you think i had something to do with that     dr  mantlo said that you'd made a pass at her at a holiday party  last year   actually  no  i didn't   i asked her about all the plastic surgery she'd had   plastic surgery   ok  look   i helped organize a fundraiser  to the hospital two years ago   that was before the surgeries   i know i still have the pictures   there   that's the picture of amy and dr  mantlo that i took that night   ok   tell me you wouldn't wanna ask her why she did it   tell me about the stalking charge against you two years ago   i asked my neighbour out   she overreacted   mr  polk  can you tell us where you were last night   i was at home  alone   i know  not much for an alibi  but i don't care   because i didn't do it   did you know that honey was dripping from the ceiling   yes  happens sometimes   i take it  beekeeping is a hobby   i'm writing a book    practical handbook of beeculture with some observ  upon the segreg  of the queen   up here   i've just started chapter nineteen  would you like to hear the last few paragraphs   did you talk to the police about that scary administrator guy     i have not    but i thought that     mr  polk is a prat  no doubt   but his body language said sub  not dom   i don't see him having the berries to take another life   why do you suppose you hate your job so much     i don't hate my job    you have two alarm clocks   no one with two alarm clocks loves their job   two alarm clocks mean it's a chore  for you to get up in the morning   you don't hate what i do  though   that much was obvious  when we talked to mr  polk   it was the look on your face     i imagine it was the same look you wore to the or when you were still a surgeon   you're wrong   i know my father secured your services for the next     six weeks   simple truth is i don't need you   i'm finished with drugs  i won't be using them again   my advice   take a six weeks holiday   i promise i won't tell pap     police station   i'm gonna need your saliva now   ten thirty seven   i take back everything i said last night  you obviously love your job   can't wait to get started  this morning   open your mouth so i can swirl  if you're on anything the strip on the couple turn blue   i have a new     i have a new theory about our killer  i think he may have struck at least once before   i     love what i do   woke up early   couldn't stop think about the ringbox he stole from amy damper's living room   you said was some sort of trophy   and you know what flavor of killers take trophies  don't you   serial   souvenirs help them differentiate between the victims   it occured to me that if amy wasn't his first there might be other cases in common   eileen reinforth   savagely beaten and strangled by an intruder in her bronx home 2 years ago   he took a jewelry box on his way out   but left behind a size 11 footprint   drug free  congratulations   especially striking are the phisical similarities between her and amy   both were curvatious  with long red hair   do you think the killer has a type   the one significant difference in the cases   eileen reinforth survived her attack   i'm sorry   i can see why you think it might be the same guy     i just don't think i can help you   we red in the police report  that the man who assaulted you wore a mask   that doesn't mean you can't help us identify him   did he say anything to you   no     i came in through my front door and he was just there   did he have a particular scent   no    i don't think so   was he tall  short  somewhere in between   i don't know  i mean  he was on top of me so quickly     his hands around my throat     and what about the mask   what about it   was it ski  mexican wrestling  paper plate     a ski      good  excellent   so    you got a good look at his eyes   correct me if i'm wrong  but a strangler can literally not be more  than a arm's length from his stranglee  can't he    mr  holmes     that's what  two  two and a half feet   i'm twice that distance from you now  and i can see that your eyes are brown   i think i'd like you to leave now   why  because i know that you're lying     mr  holmes    well  she is   you tell by the crucifix she fiddle with everytime i ask her a question   it's a pacifying behavior   it's just elementary haptic comunnication    just read a book  would you     she did see her attacker's face    sherlock     i think she might even know who he is    get out   you realize that because you protected him 2 years ago you have the blood of an innocent woman on your hand  do you   but you'd like to get for two  or three  or four     that's enough   you're done here  go wait in the car   what a jerk   i'm     i'm really sorry about that   the name of the man who attacked her is peter saldua   he was her brother's best friend  growing up   his father was abusive  so her parents took him in the senior year of high school   eileen heard from his brother that he works for a florist in chelsea   i knew it   i knew that if i would have cornered her in there  you'd come in her defense   and if you came to her defence  she might very well tell you the truth   you are so full of it   you're just embarrassed because i figured out something that you couldn't   and now you're making it seem like you plan the whole thing     this is gregson    captain gregson  shelock holmes   i'm calling 'cause i believe i've uncovered the name of a strong suspect  in the murder of amy damper   name wouldn't be peter saldua by any chance  would it   how did you know   because i'm at his house and i'm looking at him right now   are you saying he's in police custody   technically  yeah   he's all ours   mailman saw the body through the window   calls 911   said he thought someone out there tried to kill himself   turns out  he was right   the gun was still in saldua's hand when we got here   watch the blood spatter   we found the ring box from amy damper's home  right here   turns out  mantlo and his wife knew the florist that saldua worked for   they ordered fresh flowers to the house once a week   saldua was the guy who delivered them   explains why she would've let him in the other night   what happened over there   mixed his coloured with his white  who knows  that was outboard   did you already take his phone   hasn't turned up yet   but it will   you wanted to be the one who found him  didn't you   do not do what i do  to take credit   then why do you do it   i'd like to thank the police     to have found the man  who killed my wife      she had her mole removed when she changed her look   it doesn't make any sense   she loved that mole   before her surgery she turned her head to feature it      whenever her picture was taken   where did you get those photographs   i reach out to her friends  through her facebook page   harrison polk was right  she was as beautiful before her surgery  that she was after  so     why bother  what was the point   another thing     saldua phone records indicate he used his phone constantly   and then  three days ago   he just stopped   didn't make a single call  didn't send a single text  why   his bank statements  meanwhile   show several checks made out to roland jessup  psychologist   who seems to worth a talking to   but no  'cause he dropped dead of a coronary    in 2010   the amy demper case is over  you helped to solve it   no    it's too simple  too fast  something's off   i feel it   what's that   i got us tickets to the opera tonight   to celebrate      when your father hired me mentioned it's something that you like  so     i went to  le grand macabre  once  when i was nine  now i'm a buff   i'm worried about you   i think you are making things more complicated than they really are          and that tells me you are struggling    i'm not struggling with anything   i didn't even been paying attention on the last two days    i've been right about everything     actually  you haven't   the day we met  you deduce that i had give up being a surgeon     to become a companion because i had lost someone close to me     but the truth is       truth is that you made a mistake  during a surgery that costed a patient his life   it takes years of study to become a surg  not to mention a tremendous ego   surgeons don't just leave to become addicted companion   unless they faulted  in theyr own practice   you're still sensitive to the subject  so i made up that to spare your feelings   oh  so big of you   how do you know the patient died   how do you know he just didn't end paralized or in a coma   the parking ticket  the one you had in your purse  it was     you incurred to that 2 weeks ago  at the corner between the 86th and 3rd   the only thing there is calvary cemetery obviously  you were visiting a grave   not your parents' grave of course  'cause google indicates that they're both alive and well   siblings  no  calvary is a populace field   picture on you phone of your mum  and dad say that they are well to do   no siblings were to end up in a place like that   a place that doesn't even have a proper parking area  hence the ticket   so    a surgeon who's no longer a surgeon   a parking violation incurred near a poor man's cemetery   and two parent who have lots of money to save your life  roll it all up     what does it say   you were visiting the grave of the man that you let die on you operating table   it's so incredible     the way that you can     solve people just by looking at them   i noticed you don't have any mirrors around here   and what is that supposed to mean   it means i think you know a lost cause when you see one   tomorrow  i'll arrange for a new companion   tonight i've got plans   here you go   everything your dead shrink had on my dead strangler   you can    thank me   it's dusty   the guy's been dead for almost two years   his widow had all of his stuff in storage   you're lucky she even let me take a look   according to this  saldua never told him about the attack on eileen reinforth   it says he had an obsession with red haired women  and a tendence to violence   want some    mr  saldua  now obsessed with his own recovery   has taken to recording our sessions with his phone  so he can listen to them again and again    did the phone turn up yet   no   i'm starting to think he lost it   listen  i got to take a leak  keep an eye on this coat  would you    we got to discuss whenever he will shout in front of us      your ass is mine     you're both dead    rage   he felt rage   watson   watson   excuse me     excuse me     that patient  saldua  felt rage   the night he killed amy demper     he had some measure of control      i don't care right now  i don't see  you  i don't hear you     should i speak up   shush   he had some measure of control with eileen reinforth  but not with her  why   tell me  what exactly     is a xanax tablet like   small  white  ovular  why   detective abreu  please   shush yourself   not even on key     abreu    sherlock holmes   make it quick prince charles  i was just on my way out   pills vial  from saldua desk  taken into evidence  i need you to find it for me   hold on     now what   pills inside should be white and ovular   but they're not  are they  they're round and pink   how did you know   i need a ride  right now   i'm in the middle of something   you were right the other day     about eileen redford   i had no idea she would respond to you the way that she did   i just told you i did because     i was embarassed i lost my temper   would i have gotten the truth     some other way  of course   you got me there faster   now     please     how fast can you get me to sanbridge hospital   here he is   you were peter saldua's last therapist  were you   you stopped to treat him when  eighteen months ago   probably just a few weeks before you took your wife into her last plastic surgery     excuse me    saldua wanted to fix himself   dr  jessup was his first attempt   you were a second   it's quite a bit of luck  that  you  a man with a wife he wanted dead   stumbling across him   a man with ossessive personality and an history of violence   the only problem was of course   that amy didn't fit his victims profile  did she   but you countered for that by pressuring her to alter her appearance  until she did   mr  holmes  right  we met the other day   the pills vial from saldua's home  came from you   sample from hospital made out   almost impossible to trace   he thought he was taking tranquilizers  but he wasn't  he was taking steroids   that would bring him into a killing frenzy   a frenzy that made him more and more confused  more violent   more pliable to give into his terrible compulsions   i never evenr heard the name peter saldua  until the police told me    he was the man who killed amy    bollocks   i imagine you took your meetings in odd places  at odd times   so you never could have been seen together   and then  when the time was right   you took advantage of his job as a delivery man  to place him around her   you arranged for flowers to be sent to the house once a week   'cause you needed him to see her  you needed him to become     obsessed with her   you loaded him like a weapon     and you pointed him squarely     at your own wife     you're insane    no  he was insane  doctor   and you took advantage   and then after you murdered him   and made it look like a suicide  you took his phone   why  well  because he take it to record your sessions as well   a problem  of course not   killing him was always part of the plan  you just took the phone after you've done   hypothetically  mr  holmes     a man once had this marriage to a very wealthy wife   he knows that during the course of their relationship  he signed a prenuptial agreement  that gives him nothing  if he leaves her   and a living trust that gives him everything  if she dies   hypothetically     wouldn't that man be smarter to look for a way to trigger the clauses  on the second document as opposed to first   what did he say     he said that he did it    we have to tell the police   that point        we don't have any proof  he knows it   give me the car keys     what  why    the car keys   yes   better     over there    thank you   miss watson  have i told you how much i enjoy your perfume   almost makes       me forget how much urine is stain in the floor   i'm sorry   not just for your car     but for the way i spoke to you earlier   i knew the dead of your patient could have been a sore subject  i just     couldn't help yourself   yeah  i'm starting to seeing how  that's a kind of a thing with you   i assume you've told my father about what happened tonight   i'm gonna miss that brown stones     actually  you are not   i spoke with him  and since what you did at the hospital  had nothing to do with drugs   he's agreed to give you another chance   you decided to stay on as my companion  haven't you   he never would have agreed  if you hadn't   i'm very pleased  watson   both for myself  of course  but for you   i happen to think there   s some hope for you as an investigator   i want you to let me in on the rest of the plan   to get mantlo   i know you wouldn't wreck my car unless a personal purpose     temper tantrum    right   in that case  i want you to tell me about london   big place     lots of rain    i want you to tell me  about what happened to you in london     why is it so important to you    because if i'm gonna stay with you     i need to know everyting    actually  you don't need to know anything   other than i'm a recovering addicted  you want to know about london   because you think it will connect us in a meaningful way   in case you haven't noticed  i don't have meaningful connections   why are you smiling   because now i know it was a woman   what makes you say that   you're trying too hard   just like you did the other day  with that tattooed lady   all that  sex is repellent  crap   you can connect to people     just frightens you   my hearing is at 9 00 tomorrow   i trust  i'll see you there   you're late  miss watson   my barrister was rubbish   i need to show you something  this is peter saldua's medical file   look in the known allergy settings   rice allergy  this was taken     the morning his body was found   weird  right   no  actually   not even a little   dr  mantlo   sorry for the wait   i appreciate you giving me an opportunity  to apologize face to face   for what happened last night   i can't promise it'll change my mind about suing the department  over what your consultant did to my car     but it's a start   there is a just one thing i wanted to ask you   did you ever treat peter saldua as a patient   you have a funny way of saying you're sorry  captain   it's a simple question  doctor   no   i never treated peter saldua  i never even met the man   now  if that's it  i am late for an appointment with my attorney   detective   just wait one second   you know you're just taking yourself deeper  putting this man in the same room with me   dr  mantlo   this is a medical form  completed by peter saldua for another of his doctors     i told you before  mr  holmes      my assistant  miss watson   was cleaning up last night   when she very astutely noticed that saldua had a strong allergy to rice   this is ridiculous   as i was saying  miss watson noticed saldua's allergy to rice   so you can imagine her confusion   when she remembered seeing a sack of this stuff  on one of his shelves   we also found a credit card receipt  that told us he has bought it exactly two days before his death   odd that  right   him going to the store  and buying the one thing he's allergic to   oddest still  it was the same day he stopped using his cell phone   at first  i thought that was by choice   then i remember the overturned washing machine   all right  mr  holmes   amaze me   what does a bag of rice and an overturned washing machine have to do with anything   i was wrong the other day   when i accused you of taking saldua's  phone after you murdered him   you wanted to take it  but couldn't  could you  'cause you couldn't find it   he laundered it  you see   left it in his pocket when he put his trousers in the wash   by the time he realized it was too late   the phone that he turned into a virtual library of his therapy sessions  was no longer functional   furious with himself  and suffering the effects of what he couldn't possibly have known was  a steroids intoxication   he destroyed the washer in a fate of rage   then he went to the nearest grocery  and purchased a bag of rise   rice     as you're apparently not aware  is a natural desiccant   it can be used to absorb moisture from electronic devices that 've been watered   and we went to saldua's home     this morning and examined        his bag of rice   you'll never guess what we found inside   her name is amy   and i     when i see her i get these feelings     and i     please  dr  mantlo   you need to help me   you need tell me how to stop this self burning thing   it's okay  peter  it's    it's okay  i'm here for you   let's try upping your meds and see where that leads us   there's a drive  deep to centerfield  and it's gonna be     yes   please go to dinner now   it's the bottom of the ninth  the mets are within one  and noone is out   ok don't look at me like that  you said you're gonna watch it with me last night    before i got hungry     well but just because you don't understand something   doesn't mean it isn't awesome  okay   actually  miss watson   i'm quite familiar with the american pastime   so  for example  that often there cases  in the living room to watch the fights on tv   they're not  matches      they're  games   okay    truth to be told   i find that the science behind the sport  is very charming      statistical analysis  strategies      so  if you'll allow me to save us both a little time     pop up to centre  intentional walk  game ending double play   final score  reds of cincinnati  three   metropolitans of new york  two   yeah  alright  nice try     i'll meet you at the door   no   damn
