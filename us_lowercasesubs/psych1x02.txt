aggiornamento     a     g     g     o   beautiful santa barbara  california   is the backdrop for this afternoon's  coverage of the american spelling bee   being held at the downtown cabreo theater   champions from all over these western united states     have made the trek     what are you watching   nothing   is that korean porn  come on  man   it's the regional finals of the american     spelling bee   what   don't mock me  it's a huge event   no  i'm just     i'm shocked that you didn't take the whole day off   it's on sportscal2  for your information   and it's hosted by bud collins   really  did they     did they bump the car washing championships for this   and is it over soon  because  i'd like to get back to the woodcarving finals   let's recap this morning's unexpected high drama     it's being held in santa barbara this year   down at the cabreo   it's huge  sold out   i tried to get tickets  but you got to know somebody   somebody lame   dude  i can't believe you're watching that   i'm taping it  and i don't care what you think  shawn   i watch the bee semis every year   okay  for your sake and mine   stop giving the spelling bee hip little nicknames   for those of you who have just joined us   well  a bit of a shock     and a little sad  too   the heavy favorite has had a bad spell  and brendan vu is out   what   boo hoo for vu  bud   no way  brendan vu is out  already   okay  now you're just scaring me   come on  shawn   he took second last year  everybody knows that   no  gus   nobody knows that  except for brendan and his mother   okay   we're going to show this again   it looks like young mr  vu may be having trouble breathing   he does look to be under some sort of duress  bud   his inhaler did not appear to help  and vu tumbled to the floor     dag   wait a second  did you see that   this is no accident   there's something wrong with that inhaler   shawn  get out of here   psych   it's the chief   well  i'll have to check with gus   are we available   it appears we are   we'll be right there   what   i can get us into the spelling bee   really   guess i was right about the whole bandon dunes thing   brendan vu   sure   they need a psychic detective for that   they don't     unless he was sabotaged   the kid said his inhaler felt funny   when he used it  his hand stung   the paramedics get there  there's no inhaler   apparently  the thing just vanished into thin air     shawn  we are so taking this  let's go   how come i can't get you this excited about girls   let's go  shawn     or mexico   we're here   go on in  mr  spencer   i've arranged everything you need inside   you're leaving   i was only here for the mayor's presentation  and we have a robbery standoff across town   shouldn't i go to the hospital   meet the victim  get a statement   mr  spencer  the case is sabotage   there are 43 remaining  contestants  all presumably  with a motive   now  you can read guilt just by talking with someone  right   do it   do you want us to talk to all of them   and their parents   today   by 5 00   in two days  this whole thing is over   at that time  all the witnesses will be in a hundred  different cities all over the western united states   so it's now or never   good luck   spellmaster elvin cavanaugh is a secretive guy   and yet he has called for a press conference after this round   can you repeat that  please    butyraceous     definition  please   adjective   having the characteristics of butter   this thing's been sold out for weeks   i can see why  it moves so fast   it's like hockey with words   that's elvin cavanaugh  the greatest spell champion ever   he's been the spellmaster for 14 years   he's a legend   he sits up there all by himself in that fancy box   what is he  the phantom of the opera   he's a huge celebrity   he can't just sit in the crowd   can you repeat the word    butyraceous      butyraceous       oh  come on  dude  you're not bored at all   do you know how to spell any of these words   proudly  i've never heard of any of these words   i file these words under  things to say  when i want to be ridiculed or kicked out of bed     see  the problem is that   butyraceous  is clearly a round one word   oh  god  stop talking   i'd like to pretend we still have things in common  gus   well  instead of sitting here  maybe we should get to work   try not to break anything   so this is what it looks like   what   the comfort room   this is where you go to deal with missing a word   oh  yeah   where do they take you to deal with  missing your entire childhood   shawn  this misplaced malevolence you have  with the spelling bee is getting monotonous   stop hating on the bee   i'm sorry  ma'am   i do apologize for his inappropriate virulence   why are you using all these big ass words all of a sudden   i'm not doing that   that's preposterous   i was in the spelling bee myself   i almost won   are you still on that   of course i'm still on it   i knew it wasn't  o    you may have five minutes with each contestant  no more   if the room is needed  you will be asked to vacate   i'll begin with the eliminated contestants   um  actually  we'd only like to speak with the ones  that were still in the  competition when the accident occurred     ms    foote     and  let's start with the shifty eyed ones  shall we   and you were there the whole time   i was    assimilation     a  s s i m i i a t i o n   assimilation     my son     no one expect him to come this far   but he surprise everyone   you watch him win   oh  i don't know   are they running odds on this thing now   because i got some cash i'd like to lay down on the really   really tall girl with the bulldog underbite   what  is she on stilts   you do not understand   this contest  it is money for scholarship   it is entry into any school in the future   yeah  shawn   the winner of this competition can just about choose his university   your friend is right   and it teaches grace under pressure  poise  dignity     all things you can get at a hot dog eating competition   plus     hot dogs   still studying  huh   oh  she loves it   won't put that thing down   well  kudos on the child rearing   let me know how the therapy goes   we're going to keep rolling because of the  exceptional request by elvin cavanaugh   behind the scenes guy   to give a press conference  right here at this stage of the competition   what's that all about   well  i mean  this could be something big  bud   i mean  this year's competition has just been  peppered with controversy   it certainly has  well  he's been watching  from a private box on the balcony   but now he's going to come out so that we can see him   this could be something big  bud   i think he's having difficulty breathing   he does look under duress  bud   jesus   oh  my   oh  my god   okay  not to belittle this guy's life   but this just got more  interesting than the woodcarving finals   when do we decide if we should cancel this event   why would we cancel   well  a body did just tumble into the crowd   it didn't land on anybody   it might be traumatic   for who   the mayor  when he realizes all the hotel rooms are now empty   we could postpone at least a day  i'm sure that's allowed   do you have any idea how important this event is to the city   no  unhealthy guy has heart attack  falls over railing   case closed  i'm certainly not declaring it a crime scene   come on  you can introduce me to the press   okay  just be sensitive   how about if we don't sell the seat the guy landed on   uh  can i help you   has anyone come out of there   just the cops  i've been here the whole time   did you hear anything from in there   i'm sorry     who are you   uh  i'm shawn spencer   i'm a psychic with the police department   i'm sorry  mr  spencer   look  i don't doubt your ability   i actually have an aunt who could see apparitions   it's ooky spooky stuff   but they told me not to let  anybody in here without a badge  so     i see   okay   as long as you feel safe   s    safe   what with the dead guy's spirit being here   and him being so angry     how angry   well  considering he might have just been murdered   that's     i mean  that's definitely a negative   i mean  i wouldn't be happy   no  please  spare me   i'm here to help you   gus   back me up here   y    you guys just take a quick little look see  okay   i'll be downstairs   come on  get up   well     we certainly know what his vice was   he was a heavy eater  so what   nothing  i'm just  thinking lassiter's heart attack theory  might not be so far off   who's contestant 1 9 5 3   it only goes up to 200 something   what does 1 9 5 3 mean   nothing   is it a rule   no  they don't really number the rules like that   think there was an altercation   no  something else   he was all by himself up here   you smell that   dude  don't look at me   it's sulfuric   i am not the one who had the egg salad   no  no  no   we manufactured something last year  heavy stuff   when it started to go bad  it smelled the same   you could pick out a bottle across the warehouse   i can't smell anything   well  you don't have the supersmeller   gus  you have got to stop calling your nose  the supersmeller     if you want to nickname a body part   nickname your butt  man   call it  the tight bouncer     or  the hexagon     ladies are going to dig that  i'm telling you   it's there  it's right there   it's subtle  but it's right there   what is it   i don't know  it's nothing we manufactured   aren't you supposed to know this kind of stuff   i sell pharmaceutical supplies  i'm not a scientist   but you're saying it is something   yes  i'm pretty sure   don't eat it   dude  do i look like an idiot   what are you    you're taking some to go   yes  for the road   in case later on i get hungry enough  to eat something that might be poison   there are about four of them up there   another two on the other side     wait a minute  two guys up there   excuse me   hi  it's time  the press are ready   thank you   all right   thank you   man  we got to go   sorry  could i just try that again   i kind of fumbled the  safe and secure  part   sure   be sensitive   of course   the finals will continue tomorrow as scheduled   at this point  all indications are that  mr  cavanaugh was having a heart attack   stumbled forward  falling over the railing to his death   but we want to assure everyone  that this building is both safe and     our sympathies go out to mr  cavanaugh's family   and we would like to offer counseling     who's the blonde   lassiter's new partner  he transferred his girlfriend   and again  we want to assure everyone  coming out for this fantastic event that it is entirely safe   shawn  they're going to stop investigating   one last question  and i really have to go wrap up the scene   do something   moo goo gai pan   beef lo mein  kung pao   check the food   it was murder   oh  did i just say all of that out loud   shawn  you'll never find out  what that is without a lab   i'll get a lab   a high tech lab  right now   maybe   i    might have a connection   shawn   hey  dad  great shirt   you want something   why do you always think i want something   oh  you don't want anything   what a pleasant surprise   okay  you got me   i want something   i got a poker game in 45 minutes   you still talk to jim syklan   syklan  sometimes  why  what's he to you   is he still working at the regional crime lab   last i checked  why   i need to know what this is   it looks like a number 15 with chicken   dad  you made a joke   i think there's poison in it   goodbye  shawn   it's just one time  once   no cases  shawn   i was painfully clear about that   oh  no  no  this isn't for a case   this is    for a friend   oh  friend   different   no   look  i'll do anything  whatever you want   it's one favor  anything he can tell me about  this would be very helpful  it's serious   shawn  this is really important to you   extremely   and you'll do anything   name it   grab a saw   what  now   well  you said you'd do anything  right   you know   most people will wait five   six whole minutes before they cash in a favor   i will not saw through bone for you   the doghouse   from eighth grade   it's not really a doghouse   not yet   what do you want me to do   finish it   what  now   or whenever you want your information   you got more wood out back   nails on the workbench   home depot's open till 9 00   don't cut any corners   you're insane   and you're losing light   make sure you lock up   it's creepy that you kept this   shawn  you've done absolutely nothing to convince  me that you're responsible enough to have a dog   you'll never give me a chance   chances are earned  shawn   you'll never let me earn it   fair enough   you're going to need a doghouse     i saw one at the hardware store      no  no  no  no     you're going to make it    i can't   well  it seems to me that somebody who thinks they're responsible enough  for the life of an animal should certainly be able  to construct a roof for the ratty little    thing   all right  i'll make it  i'll make it right now   what is that      what is that    it's the doghouse    no  it's not     what are you talking about    i gave you specifications     when    when i gave you the job   in 1989   shawn  you know as well as i do this is not what i asked for   keep working   and don't be too loud  the neighbors are trying to sleep     you expect me to be okay with this    i worked hard on it   shawn  you've been at this for hours now   the nails aren't pounded in all the way   the base has got to be up off the ground   if it rains  it'll flow right in   and who's going to fit in through that door there   that door's not high enough   i built it  what do you want me to do   i want you to do it right   listen  dr  sloane  if i can get you this product this afternoon   would it be possible to sit down with you to discuss the  uh     m    a     the unbelievable results we've been     having with     o     i'm sorry  can i call you back   thanks   burton guster   shawn   you're in the hospital   what happened     did you call your dad    i'm fine  they're releasing me   did you call him   gus  i'm not going to talk to my dad   he'd want to know you're okay   all he cares about are results   just like those possessed spelling bee parents   you know what's wrong with this  all of this   shawn  you're delirious  you're upset   you lost control of your bike last night   gus  i didn't lose control of anything   someone tried to kill me  or send a very serious message   brendan appreciates you checking on him   well  we were in the neighborhood  and gus here is a huge fan   he almost won the spelling bee himself   i took some bad advice   well  brendan's going home tomorrow  he's fine   he's more upset about missing the spelling bee   well  maybe they'll decide to redo the whole thing   why would they do that   did you see the inhaler   same one as that little czech kid   get me a seating chart  i'll bet you i know  who brendan was ing on day one     already checked it out    nice   shawn  something's going on with that czech kid   talk to me     the doctor on his inhaler  dr  zavin in ventura       yeah    he doesn't exist   i do training on that route   the last doctor in the book is youngerman   i double checked it today   you're saying that inhaler     is a fake     where are you going    i     am going to build a doghouse   i thought you gave up   yeah  well  it doesn't appear so     what happened to your leg    absolutely nothing   you're running your roofing vertical there  huh   yeah   well  you might want to pop a ridge beam in first   well    yeah   that's    that's a given     what the hell are you doing    i'm going to help you   you've never helped me before  ever   you've never asked   put a nail in here   all right   this is weird   no thanks   not bad    not bad     it's like the park hyatt for poodles   will you call jack syklan     what is this    your results   we had an agreement   this is a derivative of methyl parathion   high grade stuff   whatever you're into  i want you to get out quick   i'm not kidding   wait a second   how did you get this so quickly   oh  syklan's a part of my poker game   so you didn't even have to call him   the game was at his house   and i did all of that for nothing   for nothing   you've never completed a thing in your life   now you have   poisoned   i feel somebody poisoned his food   there is a     styrofoam container    yes  and a      happiness is a golden poem       what  fortune cookie     this is ridiculous    is it   mr  spencer  what we have now points to a medical condition  not murder   all appearances show mr  cavanaugh having an anaphylactic reaction   not to be out of line  but that could be triggered  by several types of poisons  or altered medications   or shellfish  which he was allergic to   those results will show up in the toxicology report   which we will have a copy of in approximately two weeks   that'll be too late   all the contestants will have gone home     home   you won't be able to finish a real investigation   chief  i    i sense this   something got out of control  and the perpetrator  was willing to kill to cover it up   what proof do you have   only what i feel   why are you still listening to this crap   dude  what is your glitch   you  you are my  glitch     look  he got nowhere with his little inhaler assignment   and then he tells the media that we had a murder scene   cut him loose  karen   i mean     do whatever you think is best    chief   mr  cavanaugh was going to make an announcement   what about that   the director said he'd spoken of retiring     that's not what he was going to say    oh  you know   i know   mr  spencer  i asked you to check in about the inhaler incident   if you or your partner have anything about that   i'd be happy to hear about it   otherwise     we've got to get back into the spellmaster's room     you're serious    gus  the killer was there   there's got to be some other piece of evidence inside   we're not going to have time to get in there   besides  it's locked   we'll make it work   how hard is it to get into this event without a ticket   impossible   the new spellmaster   check it out   that's exactly what i was hoping you'd say   you can't do that to him   gus  he has to learn sometime that smoking is bad for him   we're picking it up as a new round commences   a lot of excitement in the air   the tension is becoming butyraceous  bud   i'm so sorry if my agonizing pain is inconveniencing you   what's this   it's a mark on the carpet   let's go  someone must have heard that      positions  please    time's up  shawn   did you hear me  shawn   i've got something   yes   prepare the next word   that can't be right   it doesn't mean anything  let's go   broadcast in five  four  three  two     maybe this direction   hello  we need the word now   is everything okay   something's wrong  send security   uh  no  sorry for the delay     give me a word    a word   something hard  but something you can spell   i can spell anything   except  aggiornamento       give me one    no   you are not going to be spellmaster   gus  give me a word so we can get out of here   we're so close   is everything okay up there   it's fine    banana     can you repeat that   yes   ba na na    banana    shawn  this is the third round   you could've helped me   this is a dead end  we're walking  let's go   definition  please   what   a yellow fruit   also a kind of pudding   a delicious pudding   sentence  please   what is this      anna banana would like to hear 'venus' by bananarama      banana     b  a n a n a    banana     oh  wait a second  i've got something   we got him  he was watching the czech   let me see   we need to get the next word   give me a word   no  you're ruining the whole event   suit yourself    onion      onion     onion    even dan quayle could spell that   o  n i o n   onion     are we off the list   uh  no  everything's fine   you're using his grocery list   you refused to help me   now i've got to give them something else    mitchum        mitchum     yes    when i go to albertson's   i need to buy some mitchum ice blast      and    bananas     that wasn't me  i was locked outside   i have a reputation to uphold   so he was watching the czech  we have no proof   there was no film in the camera   he was using that lens for something  else besides taking pictures  now  what   cavanaugh was known for ferreting out rule breakers   he once caught a kid stealing the advance word list   and everything he did had a purpose   you couldn't have grabbed one of these five minutes ago   we're down to the final two spellers   this has been a hard fought battle right from the start   we've had tragedy  controversy  but when it really mattered   these kids put together a fantastic display of the power of learning   pfft  look at this   brendan vu went down on  gladiolus     so   so if i'd been able see any of the competition   i could've told you that was the winning word  from the first spelling bee in 1929   okay  you're scaring me again   all of these words from that round were the winning words   they do that once in a while  they make it a theme round   this one won the 1985 bee     this one from 1943      gus  what are you saying   guess which kid got the winning word from 1953   you're staring at his father   gus  that's who cavanaugh was going to disqualify   that's what he was tracking in the rule book   it was 1953   jiri prochazka  you have the next word    mastoparietal     p    part of speech   it is an adjective   c    could i have the d    definition   yes   relating to the mastoid portion of  the temporal bone and to the parietal bone   m     a     s     t     o     p     a   r     i       i got it    let's call the chief   and this year's winner of the central california regionals  is jiri prochazka   whoop it up  people   this is what you came to see  right here   this is it  yes   this competition meant everything to miklous   oh  boy  gus  gus  here we go   gus  it's happening   i know who killed elvin cavanaugh   can't he ever just tell us to arrest someone   he does this a lot     yes    yes   i'm sorry   i'm kind of a slave to my visions  i'm a slave   do you want me to cuff him   why would i want that   just a suggestion   they just sort of come when they want to come   jiri     spell  soubrette     why is this man speaking   you can't  can you   not without help from your dad   and that's not a real inhaler  is it   this is crazy  this    this     cheating     was cavanaugh's obsession   he was going to expose you as a cheater   he was going to disqualify jiri   and you knew it  and you couldn't let that happen   you had way too much to lose   you slipped into the box   you knew his comfort was food   he was dangerously unhealthy   he's starting to go into shock     you knew he wouldn't stop the bee  he never stops the bee   by the end of the round  it was too late   he was too dizzy to walk  he stumbles   he tumbles over the rail  crashes to the chairs below     and there goes the evidence     except for one thing   that inhaler   it sends electronic signals   the transmitter is in your jacket   you sent the signals from the audience to the stage   and i bet at your home we'll find the van that ran me off the road  when i alerted the police     and a dangerous cocktail of unforgiving poisons   you don't need it   i took your advice  i ran the chinese  food through the lab  nothing's definite     i'm sorry   he just seemed sure

forever as   you know  the dude that won the spelling bee   i'm sure you would have dealt with it later   but kids  high school kids especially  they're just ruthless     judgmental     horrible little bastards   you wouldn't have been able to date a cheerleader   they wouldn't have invited you to any parties   you'd have been the object of ridicule  i mean  this way   you got to be a smart
