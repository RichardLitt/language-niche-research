michael  my name is michael westen  i used to be a spy until     man  we got a burn notice on you  you're blacklisted   when you're burned  you've got nothing     no cash  no credit  no job history   you're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in   where am i  miami   you do whatever work comes your way   you rely on anyone who's still talking to you     a trigger happy ex girlfriend     should we shoot them      an old friend who's informing on you to the fbi     you know spies    a bunch of bitchy little girls   family  too    is that your mom again      if you're desperate  i'm gonna need your help   bottom line    until you figure out who burned you        you're not going anywhere    a surveillance photo  can tell you a lot about the photographer   surveillance takes planning  you have to scout the area   you need a place to sit  and wait for the target for an hour    or 10   you need to take a leak now and then   lots of chances to get seen   michael  good to see you   you can't choose your intelligence sources   might be a heroin smuggler  a dictator  or your mom   i was beginning to wonder if you were gonna be standing  in the road all day or come in for a visit   i need to ask you something   anyone unknown to you  been around the house last few months   any unfamiliar faces on the street   maybe a repair truck that just seemed to sit there   i don't know   i really don't notice what my neighbors do   i'm not interested in them   you'd notice if the neighbor hasn't vacuumed his car   if the postman isn't wearing his wedding ring   just tell me   as a matter of fact   a few months ago  there were two men here taking pictures   they were very nice   you met them   mm hmm  they came in for coffee   i made them deviled egg sandwiches   they were in some sort of   i don't know  some government something   wait  wait  wait  government something   who exactly do they work for  how should i know   all these years  i don't know who in the hell you work for   travel all over the world  saying   oh  can't talk about it    well  i don't have a job anymore   so there's nothing you have to worry about   what did they talk to you about  what did they ask   i don't know  but i did show one of them the garden   wait  you left one alone in here  how long   hmm  i don't remember   the doctor says what's wrong with me  could be affecting my memory   your memory's fine   if there's anyone who could use a little memory loss  it's you   my mother's understanding of my career  changes with what she wants from me   one day  she can name everyone on the national security council   the next day  she thinks i work for the post office   well  my friend donna in my bridge group   she's had memory problems   which reminds me   i want to talk to you about a friend of mine   in a sec   michael  what are you doing   not all bugs are the same   if it's got a battery  it's disposable  short term   if it's wired into the house power   it's a longer term thing   if it has a transmitter   you can figure out how close the listener is   mom  are there any empty houses in the neighborhood  within  say  hmm  350 meters   across the street  two doors down   once your surveillance knows you're onto them   the clock starts ticking   they know you're coming  so the question for them  is whether they can destroy their equipment  and get out of there in time   the question for you is whether you can find them  before every bit of useful information  is turned into a pile of burning slag   what happened to you  you smell like burnt plastic   yeah  i think there's a fire down the road   um  and the smoke had drifted   mom  we need to talk about the men who came to the house   i need to know what they asked you  what you told them   it's important for my job   i thought you didn't have a job   yeah  you know  it's    it's hard to explain   yeah  well  i don't remember   this thing about my friend has me very upset   it's hard to think about anything else   fine  mother  let's talk about your friend   well  it's my neighbor laura   all right   these people came over to her house with some kind of a scam   they got all of her bank account numbers   they took everything that she has   and they beat her up  michael  she's terrified   well  what am i supposed to do   well  you'll think of something   she lives right across the street   you could go there now   i talk to your friend   and then we talk about the men who came to the house   thank you so much for coming   when madeline said you could help me   i was so relieved   well  what happened  exactly   i got a letter about a month ago   uh  said i'd won a prize  one of those magazine things   i called  and they congratulated me   said they had to send some people over  to fill out some tax forms   and they came over and     there were two men and a woman   they were in such a hurry to get my information     credit cards  bank accounts   i got nervous  and i asked them to leave   i tried to call the police  and they hit me  broke my arm   i checked my bank account  it's all gone   it's all i had   uh  do you    do you have anything that  uh     do you have a description of them   oh  i'm not very good at that sort of thing   the main one    he was good looking  blond   the other two were just regular with brown hair   regular looking with brown hair   i have the prize letter   my son wants to put me in a home now   thinks i can't be trusted   uh  i'll see what i can do   i'm gonna need to borrow this  okay   i should go   i'm gonna go   so  you're helping old ladies now   good for you  mike   hey  i saw a kitten up a tree on my way over here   they beat her up  took her life savings   you in or not   well  you put it that way  what can i say   what's the plan   the address and phone number are fake   but the printing  the foil embossing     there can't be more than one place in miami  that does that kind of work   sounds good   uh  listen  the money on this one will be a little thin   well  it's a public service  hey  how about a trade   i had a little disagreement  with the lady friend i was staying with   and i could use a place to crash   three days  i was thinking more like a week   mike  look  i can sweeten the pot on this   if i'm staying with you  the feds will be off your back   i'll just tell them that i'm babysitting you   five days  you bring a sleeping bag   and you're out by the weekend   done   hello  michael   fi  you're here   i came by for a visit   the door was locked  so i broke in   new accent   new   style   well  i'm in miami now   i can't very well be talking  like a freakin' leprechaun  now  can i   this is the new me  michael     for now   so you're staying in town  then  that's great   listen  fi  now's not a really good time for you to be     oh  jesus  mike  you didn't tell me she was gonna be here   you cost me a lot of money  you son of a bitch   i've been waiting to talk to you       i cost you   okay  for starters   what you're talking about never officially happened all right  but unofficially  even if it had   you deserved a hell of a lot worse than what you got  lady   sam   there's a reason spies don't have a lot of parties   everybody's got a history with everyone else   that was a legitimate purchase   the u s  government has no business     yeah  legitimate  a libyan arms dealer   how do you figure that   whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa   fi  i'm thrilled that you've come by   but sam and i need to talk about a job  so you need     a job  hmm   that sounds like fun   i'm in   yeah   man  i do work like that  yeah   i don't remember this piece  but we do a lot of volume   you need more like this  with the foil embossing   yeah  i mean  i don't know a lot about printing   but something like that   you got some big machines   oh  just upgraded  state of the art   want me to show you around  mm hmm   often  the best way to get intel  is to provoke action  set people in motion   pros know better   but they usually have to work with a few amateurs   and they panic   so you beat the bushes a little and see what flies out   once your frightened amateur leads you to the pros   the work begins   con artists and spies are both professional liars   cons do it for the money  and spies do it for the flag   but it's mostly the same gig   they run operations  they follow security procedures   they recruit support staff and issue orders   hey  so this guy quentin  your con artist   hangs out at a club down in south beach called onyx   it's nice   want me to go down there and do some surveillance   no  i think we're fine   i got a cover i d  for you  mikey   how do you like the name peter jordan   would you put some pants on   what  i work better when i can breathe down there   i mean  do you want to hear about this guy or no   yeah  tell me about pete jordan   he was cell mates with an ex partner of quentin's   he jumped parole about a month ago   they caught him   he's in a phoenix holding cell   but they haven't put him back through the system yet   he kind of looks like you  too  you know  more or less   not bad for a man in his underwear   hey  you think that's good  you should see me without them   when you go after a spy  you send another spy   the same goes for con artists   to catch one  you've got to beat him at his own game   be a better liar than he is   excuse me  can i help you   quentin king  right   yeah   we have a mutual friend up in new york    paco   few weeks ago   i'm at a dog track in newark freezing my nuts off  when i remember that paco said if i ever got down to miami   i should look you up   so i'm thinking   hell  anywhere's nicer than newark       so i got my ass down to miami  pete jordan  hey   pete  you got the wrong guy   no  no  i don't think so   see  i was roommates with your buddy paco for a year   he told me about that job you pulled off up in tampa     real nice   i have a business opportunity i want to discuss with you   no matter how good your cover identity is   you've got to sell it  and that's not always easy   like i said  you got the wrong guy   i don't know you  i don't know this paco   hey  i went to a lot of trouble to find you   i got a warrant on my ass  will you hear me out   i'm in water filter sales   now  you want a water filter  i can help you out   i don't want to argue with you   but what's a water filter salesman  doing with a  45 inside a shoulder holster   that's my business  but you know what is your business   there's a couple of cops  that are sitting over there by the bar      been there a while  probably liquor license   how about i bring them over here  and we talk about the terms of your parole   sometimes you have to decide just how committed you are  to pretending you are who you say you are   anyone ever tell you you're hard at making friends   paco said you had some issues   but i like to give people a chance    it's just how i am   this is what happens    you're gonna get us out of here  because i like miami  and i'm not going back to jail   so if those cops even look at me   we'll see how many slugs i can put through your liver  before they take me down   i got 20 bucks on 4  you want to take the over or the under   all right  let's go out back   smile  stand up   put your arm around me  and act like the friends i wanted us to be   all right  here we are   you want to take that thing out of my ribs now   oh  and then you send the cops right after me  uh huh   i don't like running from cops  but it has its advantages        when you flee a crime scene   i'll be in touch   eavesdropping and fieldwork go hand in hand   you want to know what your target is saying  and what he's typing into his computer   but technology can't work miracles   bugs don't plant themselves   the fact is  even the fanciest equipment  usually needs help from a good  old fashioned crowbar   get onto the boat  plant the bugs  get out quick   yep  gotcha  okay  what's that for   i could think of something   it's for the lock  if you have trouble  sam   mike  give me some credit  i mean  i can handle a lock   quentin had a colt  45  with extended controls and a beveled mag well   he's serious  be careful  sam   yeah  fi  i want you to fix quentin's car  so we can disable it if anything happens   you think you can handle that   i'm not gonna answer that   i'm off to make friends   it's me again   do me a favor  babe  take a swim   water's great   you want a drink   it depends   am i talking to quentin king or some water filter salesman       you could be a cop  you could be a fed  you could be anyone   i'm not just anyone   well  you can handle yourself  i'll give you that   so  you have something   if you burn me     let's hear your proposal   you'll meet my team  we'll see   there's your gun back   it's always useful to be able to disable a car remotely   a cellphone  some wire     you can ground the circuit on the electrical system  with a phone call   are you just about done down there   in a second   this   is an art   no  wiring crap into a car is not an art   it's about as subtle as hitting someone with a brick   hitting someone with a brick takes a lot of skill   you should try it sometime  it's all in the wrist   sorry  not my style   i know  that's right  i forgot   you only do what the suits tell you   you know  that was a cheap shot   a good cover identity keeps the target feeling in control   you talk too much  drink too much  just to let him know he's got the edge   michael  i respect what you're doing     going after checking accounts  consumer credit   i mean  it's easy   it's like picking up coconuts on the beach   i like coconuts as much as the next guy   but i'm talking about something bigger than coconuts   enough with the coconuts  what's the scam   annuities   you sell someone an annuity  and they dig deep     home equity  major assets   the money they're saving up for their grandkids   you give them a piece of paper   and you walk away with everything they own   why do you need us   you've got leads   what was your hit rate on your last scam  1 in 50   you go back to every one you missed  you nail one in five    i got tax documents  marketing stuff   and a bottle of johnnie walker blue   and we're done   well  you know  we're making money   and this forge crap    feds are all over that   but 100 grand per mark    dude  that's millions   greg  take a walk   okay   listen  you don't want this  i don't want this   in fact  i don't need this  no  no  no  i'll walk away   i want to talk about this  come on  let's talk   let's talk about it   you boys and your computers   if you've got a better way  to find encrypted passwords and account information   i'm all ears  baby   here you go  stick that up there and hurry up about it   we'd have been out of here 10 minutes ago  if you didn't argue about every little thing   i've heard surveillance through these things   it sounds like everyone's underwater   hey  if you have a way  to put a recording studio in a light fixture  love to hear it      millions of dollars   quentin acts like i'm a goddamn kid and tells me to go home   uh oh   what the hell are you doing here   what are you doing here   we live here   wha    you     you live here   oh  god  you liar  you liar   you son of a bitch   i can explain  baby   explain what   that you told me you had a yacht so you could get in my pants   is that about right   i'm sorry  baby  oh   i can't believe this   this is our third date   he said this was his boat   get out   where's my shoe   here  oh   you are taking me home right now   we are leaving  we are leaving   okay  jesus  ow   we're so sorry about this   let's go   and eventually we got out of there   anyway  it's all good   it was just a little painful in the end   of course  it wouldn't have been a problem if i didn't have  someone second guessing me and slowing the whole thing down   it was fine  michael  next time i'll check my phone   hey  how'd it go  is quentin your new best buddy   hardly  i've cracked ex kgb officers easier than this guy   we're gonna have to push these guys   drive his little team apart   old school    you know i like that   do you want the full on disinformation campaign   no  keep it small    just enough to nudge him in my direction   can do  who wants another beer   me   fi     yes   i need a favor   i need some information from my mom   she's not gonna talk about it unless we     go to dinner   i talked to her yesterday   you talked to her  of course you did   and i accepted  bringing a vegetable   i can't wait   go after a group of people directly   and they pull together  they get stronger   taking out a tight knit group  is about making them turn on each other   plant the seeds of distrust and watch them grow   i'm still thinking about it   i talked to greg and bonnie   enough about greg and bonnie  they're not in charge here   fine  i'm just saying  we can't delay this much longer   tax season is coming up   if people buy in  they do it just before april   so you and paco     you were cell mates  what  a year   i could think of worse ways to do time   paco  man  he still make that pruno   i did a couple months with him in county   and  man  he made the best prison wine   of course  sowing seeds of distrust  is harder when nobody trusts you   paco doesn't drink  what are you trying to pull   yeah     of course  i forgot   what  so you just guessed   michael   either he drank or he didn't   and i guessed right   good thing   i think he was planning on shooting me if i got it wrong   ah  nice work  mike   how's the betrayal paper trail coming   oh  great  it's actually some of my best work   i got plane tickets for greg and bonnie  and a couple of offshore bank accounts   i'll get it over there tonight and plant it   now  are you seriously taking fiona to your mom's   not like i have a choice   good luck with that  brother   fi  just do me a favor   just go easy tonight   it is such a pleasure to finally meet you   oh  welcome  please come in  come in   madeline  this is my friend laura   she just came by to say hi  see how things were going   madeline said she was sure you could take care of it   why don't you let me take that   everything's going to be fine   he used to be a secret agent   well     i i don't want to intrude on your supper   i brought a peach cobbler for dessert   yum   so  are you two getting married   i'm thinking about it   i'd like to be a june bride   mmm    that was delicious   thank you   so  um  fiona  do you live in miami now   well  we'll see  i like it here   do you have a job   i'm in between jobs  a bit like michael   i'll    i'll get the dishes   thank you   michael   thank you  fiona   mom  we had an agreement   tell me about the men who came to the house   um  they asked about you  how often you come to miami   whether you have any friends here   and they asked if we were close   you and me  what did you tell them   i told them that you were the perfect son   that you always wrote me  and you called me all the time  and that the most important thing to you was family   i told them that  and they wrote it down   why did you tell them that   i don't know  michael   it just seemed nicer than the truth   excuse me  i got a phone call   were you in on this  answer me   calm down  what are you talking about   answer me   i don't know     i got bank statements  plane tickets  huh   greg and bonnie had some plans   sometimes a great plan  comes together just a little bit too early   what  you thought you could go around me   is that what you thought  huh   why would i do that  yeah  you think about it   i need your leads  without that  i got nothing   greg and bonnie  two stupid kids i'd have to share my score with   you know what i'm saying   i swear to god  if i find out you're lying to me     i tell u the truth      this might not be what it looks like   they got a goddamn bottle of champagne   they were gonna rip me off  and go to the caymans or the seychelles         just don't do anything without me   this will be over tonight   you've been in the business way too long  when you recognize the sound of a  45 caliber over a phone   don't do anything stupid   okay  mike  i'm here  i'm at the marina   if quentin leaves the boat   our plan is in serious trouble   yeah he's here  i can see him walking around on the boat   you've got to make sure he doesn't go anywhere   don't worry about it  i'll keep an eye on him   he's planning to kill greg and bonnie   then blow out of town with the money   hang on  what do you see   he's coming out right now   i'll use fiona's gizmo  i'll just zap the car   call me when it's done  all right   that's what happens when you wire a cellphone  to a blasting cap in the gas tank  instead of to the electrical system   son of a bitch   fiona  you were supposed to stop the car   not blow it into the everglades   what happened to shorting the ignition   well  you said   disable   it's not going anywhere   you know what i meant   i almost had him  i was this close   the fbi is back  i see  i'm under surveillance again   sam  i thought you were supposed to handle that   mike  there's only so much i can do   i got to tell the suits why we're down at the marina  to keep them off our back   but if somebody starts blowing up cars down at the marina     you're friends with someone who put the fbi back onto you   that is so unfair   sam  what about quentin   you were supposed to nudge him   not send him into a homicidal frenzy   look  you guys were off doing your thing   so i signed up greg and bonnie through this medallion airways  executive service to the cayman islands   you know  as part of the setup   well  they got this new thing  where they overnight a bottle of champagne to the new members   quentin started sniffing around   and in less than an hour  he found everything that i did   it was little stuff  but he put it all together   fiona  turn him around  make him trust you   he's not in a trusting mood  fi   i know you're angry  michael   but i know that an exploding car  can throw a man off balance   you'll thank me   he won't even talk to me  he won't even answer my calls   well  you'll have to be extra charming   whether you're in moscow  tehran  or miami   club girls are a good source of information   men say things to a beautiful woman   they give out phone numbers  hotel keys   they let down their guard   getting information from a club girl means buying drinks   it's no problem with an operational slush fund   it's a big problem if you're spending  cash scrounged from your mom's purse   you have to help me out  please  please   we're doing this night at a club in hollywood beach    amazing   i mean  i'm flying in a d j  from berlin   it's gonna be crazy   quentin reserves a v i p

do you want   same thing as before    make some money   where are you  i'm laying low   when can we get together   i don't think that's a very good idea right now   quentin  buddy  i'm the only guy

saying     someone who can deal with this   it'll cost some money   but he'll make this go away    quiet  no connection to you   one wire transfer    it's done   and then we can go on with our business   a hit man is like a plumber  a dentist  or a mechanic     everybody's always looking for a good one   all right  let's set that up  he'll do both of them   how much    50 000   they'll both

caribbean   uh oh   okay  there they go   don't look so smug   i don't much like dealing with paranoids   they get erratic  make bad decisions   that could be a help  when you need them to make a bad
