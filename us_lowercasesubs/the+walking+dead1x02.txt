something happens  yell down to us     get us back up here in a hurry    okay   okay  everybody knows their jobs   dah   sorry for the gun in your face   people do things when they're afraid   not that it was entirely unjustified   you did get us into this   if i get us out  would that make up for it   no  but it'd be a start   next time though  take the safety off   it won't shoot otherwise
