management  so little touching   so little touching   you know i hear that even if you're not in the mood   if you start and just let it happen  that  something'll kick in       yeah    yeah  that's what you're supposed to do  anyway   yeah  maybe   you know  i thought when i quit my old job that i would gain  in time what i lost in salary   but being a working mom is like  being a currency that never has enough value  oh my god  i'm gonna steal that line   plus  it's not easy  you know  having these two parents  who have this absurd iconic romance   i know  they're so ron and nancy   who made you this way   you ok  mom  you need help   you know  why don't you ever bring anyone home   i told you  we're not ashamed of     mom  mom  we've had this conversation  ok   there's no issue  i work a lot  it's hard to meet guys   but  it's not something     don't start with me because you won't fight with kitty   if you two just got it out  what     ok     hey     hey   oh   oh  that's right  oh   now  stop avoiding each other and talk   ok   so   isn't this nice  here we are all   it's been so long   oh  i should've put these napkins out   nora   mom  you know     hello  hold on a second   we probably have a lot to say each other  right   you know what  kitty  we really don't  really  we don't   you don't want to talk  really   what kind of a relationship is that   it's the only kind of a relationship we can have right now   kitty  your father is watching us  and it is so important to him      could we hug or something   thank you   what the hell you doing calling my home   you out of your mind   brothers   sisters  tommy  you wanna do something   i am  i'm having a beer  now come over here and join me   boy  it's such a relief when they're finally asleep     the kids    no  the folks   you know  they actually seem really great   hey  does anybody wanna go out  there's this great bar in chinatown  we could tear up   do they allow people with jobs to go there   or is it just for unemployed hipsters who know every episode of scooby   no  it's also a kind of a favorite of gen y veterans from foreign wars   ah  you   ah  no  i'm on new york time   all right  ciao  everyone   i love you   bye  thanks   bye   you guys are all really nice   obviously  i'm worried   you know  i keep telling you guys   he's ok  he's just finding himself   yeah  i think so  too   you all do the walker watch on him   anybody'd get spooked by that   god  he's right  that's why i don't live here   if you lived here  you'd have more control over what's said about you   what  do you think i care  what do you say about me   you're fat   so  you and mother  not a disaster  right   oh  maybe she's planning on a sneak attack for later   i'm surprised you didn't bring your muscle   what's up with jonathan  hmm  anything you wanna tell us   ah  no  sarah  what did you tell them   nothing   no  no  no  nothing   no  we  we like him   oh  but   but  it's you with him  i'm not over the moon about   you seem slightly     i don't know  smaller  to accomodate what you see as his very large presence   he's a little self involved  that's all   oh  that is so not true   oh  when we had dinner in new york last year   he chose the restaurant  the wine  everything   i was  like   where's kitty    oh  god  that is absolutely not true   hey  maybe it's just part of the whole conservative  anti feminist thing  right   to put yourself in some sort of second place   you know what  kevin  you're gonna have to get over thinking that my politics  are just poses geared to annoy you     about jonathan  it's not really our place      no  no  no     if kitty's happy   hey  hey  no  look   not at all  i  i can't keep a guy   joe and sarah are in counseling   the whole family's       what    what   oh  that's great  that's great  i told one person  kitty   you know what  forget about jonathan  and the fact that you think i'm  some horrifying little zombie with him   i'm sick of the cracks about my political beliefs   i am conservative   tough on crime  big on defense  america first   old fashioned  and in your face   i'm with you there  kit   and if you think this is funny  great   i'm glad to be of comic service  but  you just keep on laughing and watch  the rest of the country pass you by   you set her off  kevin   yeah  you set me off  kevin   hey  i'm sorry about the counselling thing   i really only told kitty   forget it  i am immune to your family by now   good night  babe   good night   mr  walker   well  i kinda like this one   not sure about the apple  though   it's a peach   hey  guys   the new labels   i wish i had more for you  but  i can't seem to get my designers paid   your uncle saul's in charge of accounting  you'll  have to deal with him  ok   i'll go hound him again   tommy  how are things up in ojai   overtime glitch   it's all fine  i took care of it   good   jonathan   what are you do    what  what   oh my god  that suit   you look like a penguin in the sahara  what are you doing here   a little birthday present   i figured you need a little vacation time   after all this  i booked us a suite on lanai   what  i have to  i have to get back and do the radio show   well  you got a lot of time off  dear   oh  ok  wow   i guess it's just that i'm focused on this interview tomorrow  so     we don't have to go if you don't want  we'll just go back to new york   no  no  it's great   i got us a suite and i'll have somebody move your bags   oh  ok   red flags go up  i get a call    red flags go up  what else can i say   look  they were paid  you were called off   you have no reason to be here other than showboating   you know what  i resent that  this is the third time   woah  woah  this has happened before   it was a mistake  sarah  that's all   bookkeeping  ok   we're trying to modernize   ok   in the future  if you have a problem  please call me  anytime   thank you   don't look at me   three times  saul  what's going on   sarah  darling  i'm trying to streamline our billing   my books are on one system   the bank's are on another   it's fine  it's gonna be fine   oh  crap   this is not deliberate  holly   oh  please  william  this     you are handling me as if i am a problem   that's exactly how you are behaving   i have been calling here all week and you  won't talk to me     i have expenses  i have bills to pay  i      holly  i can't     holly  i'm having cash problems  i     it's my son  can we talk about this later   you're late   ah  is everything all right   there's a job  at a restaurant   i made a call   the boys at rousseau's are expecting you tomorrow   sorry to call you back here   but you developed the line  so      for grown ups  this makes it look like  kiddie crack   family branding  it's called   have they seen the stats on childhood obesity   we're gonna get killed for pushing liquid candy   caffeinated liquid candy and  it's not  us  anymore because you  abaondoned me  remember  you quit   apparently  just in time   i'll get them to take another pass at it   i just wanted to make sure i wasn't crazy   you know you're not   so  ah  is it better with your job with your father   are you spending more time at home   almost   ah  sometimes   and joe   things better   yeah  yeah  things are good   you know  i should probably get going  you know  it's not a betrayal to talk about it   i'm your friend   yeah  so we keep saying   it's good to see you   it's just    you didn't leave because of us   because of something that might've happened   i would   i would hate to think that   no  not at all   and we have lives  families   we knew where the line was   right  that's right   the blue chair is here  the moderator white chair is here   and then this is you   oh  and we have an amazing print campaign to announce your arrival   oh  no  oh  god   what   oh no   the poster's my closer   you know  it's just that i've seen the show and   for me  politics is not about show business   it's    well  i'm very passionate about my views   what makes you think we don't want that   well  the fact is is that radio  it works for me   i get to mouth off and then i go to the movies  and i'm not out there     yeah  in other words  you can hide in satellite radio   peek out just enough to not make a difference   i mean  seriously  if we're talking about passion  we give you a national profile  that absolutely comes with risk and an uncomfortable level of exposure for someone like you  but      i guess the question is is how much do you believe in what you're saying   and how much do you want people to hear you   oh  sorry   oh  no  no  no  no  hold up  i want you to meet kitty walker   kitty  warren salter   warren's our blue chair guy   nice to meet you   hi  nice to meet you     red hot  wow  so  i get blue      oh  don't even go there   i've heard your work   hmm  i've seen yours   so you know  i can be very mean   hmm  i can do mean   could be fun   wow  see how great you two are together already   c'mon  it's insane   pleasure to meet you   nice to meet you   what are you doing in saul's office   he'll go bananas  like a fierce little old    come here   what   it's just that there are all these accounts  stuff i've never seen before     and they're locked    locked   yeah  it's not cool  tom  this is a family business   there shouldn't be any secrets here   what is all this   these accounts  why are they locked   what are you doing   sarah  i move money around  that's what i do   nobody's ever had a question   ok  but i do  so     why don't you open them up and you can  walk us through it   right now   yeah   no  that's impossible   and i have to tell you  i don't like what's going on here   the two of you barging in here with this agenda   you have obviously violated my trust  not to mention my office   no  no  no  no   why not just include us  please   because  thomas  i have a meeting with all of our napa valley suppliers  and  frankly   i think that's a lot more interesting and a lot more important than  doing this tap dance with you kids   saul  this company has a serious cash flow problem   and we need to know why   and let me be very clear about this     i won't be scolded and i won't be handled or spoken to like i'm a child   so  the next time that you have an impulse to talk to me like that  please     take a beat and reconsider   ok     boo    hey  kit   i ordered you a martini   you look happy   i guess i do   i don't know  i don't know  i just     well  i didn't expect them to be smart   wow  so  you're actually considering this    i know it's crazy to even think about it   but it's like millions of people watching   ah  i see   what do you see   i haven't even said anything yet   but  there's no reason  hypothetically  why you couldn't relocate to l a   if the show was a success  right   i mean  not that it would be  because  politics  it's just     well  at the end of the day  there's just nothing you can do to make it sexy  because it's    jonathan   of course they're gonna want you   of course they're going to make it appealing   but  i think maybe there's a better job     stay in new york   start a family with me   i thought you needed time to think about it   i am thinking about it   don't get too excited  big boy  you haven't closed the deal yet   it's looking good  isn't it   the thing is    is i'm really thinking about this job   i mean  what if it is worth it   what if i can really make a difference   by being an 11 30 smartass on tv   wow  ok     look  i just know what we have   and i don't want to lose that to this     media thing   i've seen what happens to people   correct me if i'm wrong   but this kinda sound like an either or   i see our live together in new york   it's just the way i see it   how is it that everyone in this town knows you   well  i've been around long enough   so    not that i don't appreciate a free lunch  darling     dad  something's not right     with the company   i can't generate new business without start up funds   we supposedly have it  so how come i can't get a dime   i'll talk to saul   no  i already did   dad  i found some things     some locked accounts   if something was wrong  you would tell me  right   you'll have to promise me you won't talk to your mother about this     of course   saul's having some kind of    his management of financial matters     he's failing   failing  you mean  like he's losing his faculties   i'm not sure  i'm not sure  he's been extremely secretive  i can't get a straight answer out of him   did he lock you out of the files  too   he did     dad    it's my mistake  i let it go on too long   but he's family   monday  i'll talk to him  if he doesn't give me an answer     i'll do what i have to do   no  saul  no more time  we need to have something that makes sense   monday   william  william   kitty and jonathan are here   they're early   ok   so  i'm i'm sorry if we were a little early   things got a little tense at the hotel   that happens  small spaces   well  it's more that he wants to get married   he does   that's great  isn't it   well  i'm actually a little more interested in this job than i thought i would be   right  well  i'm sure you'll make the right decision   you don't have an opinion  mom   oh  kitty  please  please don't push me  i'm trying so hard   yeah  i see that   i see you bending over backwards to be polite   you want my opinion if you should marry a man i barely even know   well  it was your choice   you were the one who virtually refused to be in my life for three years   who barely spoke   and i know it's because i unforgivably gave my opinion about justin   not refused  couldn't   i was afraid of the things i didn't want to say   well  let's just say it   that i sent justin to war  that i put him on the front lines   that's reductive  that's ridiculous   he trusted you  he asked you and you said to him     i told him the same thing i would tell him today   i told him that i was proud of him   i was there     i was right there   i was in new york  i was six blocks away from where the towers fell   i know where you were  kitty  for god's sakes  you're my child     i was terrified for you   i was on the phone with you   and then i was terrified for him  day after day after day      you have no idea what it's like for a mother   you have no idea   and  then  you don't think about that when you go on the air and you sell your views   and now you're going to be doing it on national television   oh  kitty  that's just great   really great   no  mom     this is not just about my politics   tommy and dad think the same things i do  and  you've managed to reconcile forty years  of loving somebody who fundamentally disagrees with you   but you can't love me   and i   i don't know what it's about   but  it's not about the war   hey  can i ask you a question   the answer is no  you can't borrow my surfboard   no  i don't have any money to lend you   and  yes  girls still think you're cute   i'm kidding   what   all right  so dad  right  i'm at the office the other day and i saw something   yeah  what   no  it was just this blonde lady he was  like  talking to at the office   around lunchtime  yesterday   yeah   her name's holly harper   she and dad have been friends for years   ah  so there's  like  nothing going on    nah  nah  nah  nah   they've been friends a long time   i would know if anything was going on   i work with him   you're tripping   i'm a moron     thanks  sweetie    you're welcome   so  did kitty and mom have a       fight  yes  drama   all right  listen up  a toast     to the birthday girl  to kitty  my beautiful girl   with you home  the circle is complete   we're all here  together     and i must announce  with some trepidation you're longer grounded   when she was 14  she was grounded indefinitely   what for   oh  it had something do with cigarettes and surf wax   and shoplifting  and a boy named pablo   pablo   i forgot about pablo   who's pablo   a name i never want to hear again   to my little sister kitty   who  at age 7  ate all my girl scout cookies  which  prevented me from winning a trip to space camp     which completely destroyed my dream of becoming an astronaut   to kitty  because of whom i'm always being asked to join the log cabin republicans   oh  you know what  you should  they're great  they love me   to my big sister  kitty  who taught me how to surf and how to kiss  believe it or not   that is so not true   justin  stop telling that story   it's not true   my dear     to kitty  who i will probably always violently disagree with  but     who i've never stopped loving   not for one moment of her 38 years   happy birthday  baby   cheers   thank you   i think you should take that job if you want it   i think i do   we fight  we      fight   it's not the end of the world   just come home   planet
