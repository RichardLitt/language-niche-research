everyone else   but    come on   doesn't your race have a rather sordid history or exploiting  and feeding off innocent people     for centuries    three points   number one  show me documentation   it doesn't exist   number two  doesn't your race have a history of exploitation   we never owned slaves  bill  or detonated nuclear weapons   and most importantly  point number three   now that the japanese have perfected synthetic blood  which satisfies our nutritional needs   there is no reason for anyone to fear us   i can assure you that every member of our community  is now drinking synthetic blood   that's why we decided to make our existence known   we just wanna be part of mainstream society   hi   y'all have tru blood   for real   you get vamps in here   i didn't even think

well  no doubt   i reckon you're not too happy about being rescued by a woman   thank you   i can't hear you   thank you   no  no  no  i can hear you  but i can't     oh  my stars   aren't you afraid to be out here alone with a hungry vampire   vampires often turn on those who trust them  you know   we don't have human values like you   a lot of humans turn on those who trust them too   i'm not a total fool   but you have other very juicy arteries   there's one in the groin that's a particular favorite of mine   just shut your nasty mouth  mister   you might be a vampire  but when you talk to me   you will talk to me like the lady that i am   you wanna drink the blood they collected   i understand it makes humans feel more healthy   improves their sex life   i'm as healthy as a horse   and i have no sex life to speak of  so     you can just keep it   you could always sell it   i wouldn't touch it   what are you   i'm    i'm sookie stackhouse  and i'm a waitress   what's your name   i thought it might be antoine or basil or     or  heh    or  like  langford  maybe   vampire bill   oh  my   so     silver  huh   i thought that only affected werewolves   i    i    i'm not implying that werewolves exist   i mean  that's just what you always see in the movies   i'd appreciate it if you didn't share this information with anyone   we don't like for our weaknesses to be made public knowledge   see ya  bill   i gotta get back to work   thank god     you okay    i'm fine   and  for your information   not all vampires can take care of themselves     night  sam    night   night

customers are stupid people   yeah  but     i could help you keep an eye on sookie   you see the way she was looking at that vampire   that is just trouble looking for a place to happen   and she means too much to both of us to let anything happen to her   be here tomorrow at 6   and learn this on your own   i don't have time to train you   i was mixing whiskey sours for my mama when i was in

the bar   did he have fangs   yeah  but most of the time they stayed put away     did he bite anybody    no   he just had a glass of wine   he ordered it  but didn't drink it   i think he just wanted some company   did you like him   he was real interesting   i'll let you get to bed   okay  honey  i just stayed up until you got here   come on  tina   hello   i never thought i would be having sex with you   at least     not so fast   who said anything about sex   how come you didn't tell me you beat up the rattrays last night     i haven't even seen you since then    where's gran   hanging the laundry out back  and you keep your voice down   i don't want her to know about any of this   fortenberry couldn't wait till i got to work to tell me all about it   hoyt fortenberry  how the heck does he know   he went over to the rats last night to buy some weed   and denise drove up like she wanted to kill somebody she was so mad   the only way she would sell him any weed was  if he would drive mack to the hospital in monroe   did hoyt tell you that mack came after me with a knife   motherfucker  you want me to kick his ass   i already took care of that  thank you   what are you doing with him anyway   did you know that in addition to dealing drugs   the rats also happen to be vampire drainers   one of my customers last night was a vampire   and they were draining him out in the parking lot   i couldn't have that   you do not want to get mixed up with vampires     trust me    oh  shut up   even if you hate vampires   you can't let trash like the rats go and drain them   it's not like siphoning gas out of a car   they would have left him die   who fucking cares  he's already dead   that's not his fault   what did he look like   handsome  in a sort of     sort of old fashioned  like from a movie on tcm     was he bald headed    no     he had really nice hair    tattoos   none that i could see   sakes alive  boy  where have you been keeping yourself   you get on over here and hug my neck   you get here  gran   how's my girl     you're all sweaty    i know     you want some ice tea    i would love some ice tea   here  i got it     want the rest of that    yes   thank you   if you're gonna wear that suit  you might want to watch what you eat   you look nice   that was evalee mason   guess who was found strangled to death in her apartment     maudette pickens    oh  my lord   she didn't show up for work  wasn't answering her phone   and so her boss called bud dearborne   he rode over  got the manager to let him in   and they found her  i went to high school with maudette   can you believe it   a murder in benton   why are you surprised now that we got ourselves a vampire   just because he's a vampire doesn't mean he's a murderer   fang bangers go missing all the time in shreveport  new orleans   they never find them but everybody knows the vampires are killing them    and then disposing of the bodies    what's a fang banger   a vampire groupie   men and women who like to get bitten   my stars   maudette was a fang banger   how do you know that   i don't know  sookie   the way that you just know things sometimes   there's also hookers  who specialize in vampires   they drink tru blood to keep their supply up   and they keep a bodyguard there in case the vamp gets a little too frisky   i read that in a magazine   wonder how much one would charge for something like that   a thousand bucks   see  now that just makes me sick   i know   what kind of cheap woman could ever do something like that   no  it makes me sick that they're getting a thousand bucks  to lay there and do nothing while i bust my ass for 10 bucks an hour plus tips   i don't think they just lay there   i think they're expected to   you know   participate   thanks for lunch   what   what   this can't be happening to me  how could i lose control like that     how come she      don't try that with me  goddamn it   i'm your brother   back to work   please   come on  dawn  i'm having a really bad day     that is not my responsibility    didn't we have a good time   and don't you want to have that again   i'm sorry to break it to you  but you are not my only source for a good time   no  but i am the best one   oh  my god  you're so full of shit     but i'm hot    so am i   yeah  i know  i know   that's why i'm on the phone with you   all right  i give up   you can meet me after work   i gotta go  i'll call you back   sheriff dearborne   afternoon  jason     there something i can help you with    you know maudette pickens   sure  i know her   i buy stuff at the grabbit quik  she works there during the day   how would you characterize your relationship with maudette   relationship   i didn't have a relationship with her  i barely even knew her   so you're aware she was murdered last night   i mean  yeah  yeah  i did know that   my grandmother told me at lunch   somebody called her   what's up with jason and the law   maybe they think he knows something about maudette   you ever visit maudette at her apartment   me  no   ever   boys  i could do a lot better than maudette pickens  believe me   you weren't there last night   last night   okay  yeah  i was there last night     then why didn't you say so    what   then why didn't you say so   because i know she got killed   and i thought it would look bad me having been at her place     well  it does look bad  jason    it looks real bad   okay  look   i hooked up with maudette last night  we had sex   that's all   how would you characterize the sex     tt was okay    nothing out of the ordinary   because we've already seen the videotape   you didn't know she was taping it   but i should have   you need to come with us  jason   just let me tell rene to take over   i'll be right back   i hate that little shit   i gotta go into town for a while  you'll take over     everything all right    yeah  no  it's nothing to worry about   everything's fine   don't tell my sister  okay   what'd you do  jason   let's go  move   what the fuck  huh   what's up  gran   i was just wondering how old you think the vampire is   the one you met last night   i have no idea   why   you think he might remember the war   the civil war   could be   if he does   i would love to have him come speak  to the descendants of the glorious dead   you think he might want to   i think he might have a hard time showing up at the public library  at noon on a thursday   we could have a special meeting at night   or he could just come talk to me and i could tape his recollections   i am sure the other members would find it so interesting   i'll ask him next time he comes in to merlotte's   if he comes in   for all the beans     oh  baby    oh  baby     you can do better than that    oh  baby     how you doin'  what you doin' here    i work here   the hell you don't   oh yes  the hell i do too  you ugly bitch     you need to make peace with that    shit   sam must have lost his damn mind   because you should not be allowed to work in no situation  where you actually got to interact with people   that is so no true   do    do not snap at me   i have a name  and that name is tara   and isn't that funny   black girl being named after a plantation   i don't think it's funny  in fact  it really pisses me off  that my mama was either stupid or just plain mean   which is why you better be nice if you plan on getting a drink tonight   sorry  ma'am   do you know if sookie found out anything about her brother    getting arrested this afternoon    jason got arrested     for what    i ain't sure   but maudette pickens did get found murdered   are you serious   jason couldn't kill anybody   and he can do a hell of a lot better than maudette pickens     you still got a thing for him    i do not   he's too damn stuck up for me   that boy is sex on a stick   i don't give a good damn how stuck up he is  how you doin'   look at you  scaring that white boy   ain't nobody scaring him  he too big to be scared   i likes a big man  look at that belly   don't you have something to fry   you can be my santa claus   i'll see you later  i'm in the phone book   arrested  for what     i don't know    sorry about your brother   how come everybody knew about this before i did   i was there  baby girl  i saw him get carted away   i was complaining to arlene about jason hanging up on me  when we were making a date  not calling me back  that's when she told me     how does she know    i guess rene told her   besides  we figured you'd just     i just what   sweetie  didn't you just know already   i am not    psychic   damn  you suck   quiet you   i cannot believe i am here on my night off   just pouring my hard earned money back into sam merlotte's pocket   what happened to my brother   hell  i promised him i wasn't going to tell ya you   what happened   bud dearborne and andy bellefleur   they asked him some questions   and then they just threw him in the back of the squad car   so you don't even know for a fact that they arrested him     they didn't cuff him or nothin'    sookie  i am so sorry   for what  y'all are already acting  like jason's been convicted of killing maudette   we don't even know what they were talking to him about   bud dearborne just made a mistake  that's all   it has to be  because jason's a real standup guy   no  he's not  hoyt   he is selfish  egotistical  and a complete horndog   but he is not a killer   now  just look at that  like she's walking down the aisle  on her goddamn wedding day  honey  just 'cause     it's that vampire   he's got her in his sights  i need to protect her   that's that vampire she saved last night   sookie  please do not     good evening  miss stackhouse   it ain't right  him being here with normal people   she's going to sit     i always thought she was nice  but i just wonder  what kind of a good christian girl would even look at a vampire     i don't think he looks that kind of scary to me   looks like she likes 'em tall  dark  and dead     stackhouse family ain't nothing but trash   your hand is cool   yes     i'm afraid i'm not as warm as the men that you must be accustomed to   what men   what can i get for you tonight   what are you   i told you  i'm a waitress   you're something more than that   you're something more than human   i beg your pardon   that's an unusual name   is it short for something else   nope   just plain sookie   may i call on you sometime   call on me   may i come and visit with you at your home   sure   my grandmother would love to meet you   that reminds me  can i talk to you after work   i have a favor to ask you   of course  after all  i am in your debt   not a favor for me   for my grandmother  if you'll be up     i guess you will be  would you mind meeting me around the back of the bar  when i get off at    probably around 1 30   i'd be delighted   do you realize that every person in this establishment  is staring at us right now   they're just staring at me because     my brother's in some kind of trouble with the police   but bill  did you know maudette pickens   i did not   they are staring at us because i am a vampire   and you     are mortal   who cares what they think   i want to make this town my home  so     i do   i'll see you at 1 30   run away as fast as your legs can take you     i guess      this is wrong  it's wrong   i shouldn't be feeling like this  i just want to watch them do it  damn   he hypnotized her  i heard they can do that  just by looking at you  she's gonna let him fired   i'm telling reverend     you're being a very stupid girl   who asked you  i can take care of myself   i don't think so  mack could have cut you up last night     how do you know what he'd have done    you settin' up a date with a vampire   what do you have  a death wish  i don't have one   i happen to think judging an entire group of people based  on the actions of a few individuals within that group is morally wrong   i will not let you put yourself or this bar in danger  i won't   am i fired   no  but next time you think somebody's being harmed in the parking lot   pick up the phone and call the police   do not go out there alone like a goddamn vigilante   oh  ch re   don't you know i couldn't stand to lose you   feels so warm  i can't help it  i want you  damn   you smell so good  i love the way you smell   i love you and i always have  i want to tell you the truth     are you out of your ever loving mind  that vampire wants you for dinner   i won't let you just walk into his trap  ma'am  over my dead body   you mean too much to me  don't you look at me like that  when i'm looking out for you  i never noticed how much  you and jason  have the same eyes   such sweet eyes  he could never kill anybody   oh  for heaven's sakes   jason is never going to care about you the way you care about him   what the fuck y      you made a promise  you stay out of my head   i know how hard for her it's got to be     maybe jason will get shook up by this whole maudette     shut up  the both of you  and stop bossing me around   i am a grown woman and i am the one who decides what i do  not one of you     you want me to wait with you until      go home  sam   good night
