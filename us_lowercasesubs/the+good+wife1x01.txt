 good morning   an hour ago  i resigned as state's attorney of cook county   i did this with a heavy heart  and a deep commitment to fight these scurrilous charges   i want to be clear   i have never abused my office   i have never traded lighter sentences for financial  or sexual favors   at the same time  i need to atone for my personal failings  with my wife  alicia  and our two children   the money used in these transactions was mine     and mine alone   no public funds were ever utilized   but i do admit to a failure of judgment in my private dealings  with these women   alicia and i     ask that the press please respect our privacy   give us time to heal   with the love of god  and the forgiveness of my family   i know i can rebuild their trust   i want to thank the people of chicago   it has been an honor to serve you   and i pray that one day   i may serve you again  thank you   sir  are you still involved with prostitutes  sir   how many were there  sir   will you ever try to hold public office again   sir  answer the question   we have interviews set up with the tribune and channel four   absolutely not  i'm not doing any more interviews   i want you to cancel all of them   that's it  i'll tell channel two  we don't have a comment at the present time   but we emphatically question the authenticity of this thing   hey   you all right   mrs  florrick  how long have you known  your husband was having an affair   how are you going to protect your children   oh  excuse me  isn't the staff meeting at 9 30   you're in the wrong conference room  it's up one floor   oh   god     this is a major class action   a case that could propel us to the top rank  of full service firms  and i don't think i need to remind you  what that will do to your year end bonuses   anyway  sheffrin marks fired their last firm  because they took their eye off the ball   so  until further notice   your personal lives have been cancelled   so  we'll need some of you  to help out with the lower profile client work  to free up our top litigators   ed  you take the witness prep on highway redistribution   don  you take the brighton criminal   and alicia will take the pro bono   huh   everyone else  your task is to show sheffrin marks  our  a  game  okay   let's do this   will   alicia   hey   i'm sorry i didn't introduce you in there   everything's moving real fast with this class action   well  i just wanted to say thank you for the opportunity   it's a real life saver   no  glad you could come aboard   hope you're all right with this pro bono   how'd it sound   interesting  good   don't be nervous  you worried about the gunshot residue   the  um    oh  god   nice ring tone  who gets that   oh  my mother in law  my daughter programmed it   and what's yours   i don't want to know   so  um  the gun residue     diane  you're briefing alicia  right   good  you're in good hands   so  let's catch up  have dinner   so  will speaks highly of you   he says you graduated top of your class at georgetown   when was this   uh huh   and you spent two years at     crozier  abrams   abbott   good firm   will says you clocked the highest  billable hours there  why did you leave   well  the kids and peter's career   hmm   brian  can you get mrs  florrick the files   mm hmm  sure   i want you to think of me  as a mentor  alicia   it's the closest thing we have  to an old boys' network in this town   women helping women  okay   okay   when i was starting out  i got one great piece of advice   men can be lazy  women can't   and i think that goes double for you   not only are you  coming back to the workplace fairly late   but you have some very prominent baggage   but  hey  if she can do it  so can you   thanks  brian   like many law firms  we donate five percent  of billable hours to pro bono   sadly  i'm long past my quote on this one   jennifer lewis  26 years old   taught second grade   accused of killing her ex husband   prosecution thought it was a slam dunk 45 years   but the jury came back last week deadlocked   six jurors voted to convict  six not   i'm not even sure why the state attorney  is re trying except he wants    justice   he wants to prove himself  so  stick with my strategy  from the first trial  the police focused  on jennifer so early in the investigation   they never even looked for the carjacker   deadlock a jury a second time   they'll never re try a third  okay   okay  our investigator can get you up to speed  for the bail hearing at 3 00   cormac  i'm ready   the hearing's today   well  we could delay  but that would leave  jennifer incarcerated for another month   don't worry  you'll be fine   the asa's not going to argue against a recognizance release   let's go  meeting's at 10 30   but i do admit to a failure of judgment  in my private dealings with these women     sorry       mine and mine alone   no public funds were ever utilized   the recent news     oh  hey  let me help you with that   no  i'm fine   no  no  i'm heading that way anyway   i'm cary  the other new associate   oh  right  alicia   yeah  look  i know we should be at each other's throats   but i just want to say i really respect what you're doing here   raising a family and then jumping right back into this   my mom  she's thinking of doing the same thing   great  yeah   so  you're on the pro bono  right   mm hmm  yeah  that's great   i interned last summer at the innocence project   my dad's best friend is barry scheck and it was just amazing   helping people  here  they got me on the sheffrin marks   i'm sure it will be challenging  but at  the end of the day  what have you really done   saved a corporation a few billion dollars   you want to trade   i would  but i guess they have other plans  so     i am almost done  cary  the latte's on your desk   thank you  hi  mrs  florrick   looks like we share an assistant   so tell me when i'm hogging her  okay   and let the best man win   excuse me   uh  let the     nothing   it's nothing  i     it's nothing   oops   don't worry  it's yours   oh   kalinda sharma  i'm the in house   oh  the investigator   you're peter florrick's wife   that's right   i worked with him at the state's attorney's office  three years   he fired me   okay   so  what do you know   the client is a second  grade school teacher   jennifer    lewis   she was arrested for killing her ex husband   making it look like a botched carjacking   gunshot residue  was found on jennifer's face and hands   that's why the cops started to think it was a murder  disguised as a carjacking   according to them  jennifer shot her ex husband  and wiped down the gun  and the motive   he remarried and wanted custody of the three year old   witnesses saw them arguing a week before the murder   hey  mom  pick up the phone  hey  mom  pick up the phone   hey  mom  pick up    sorry  that's my daughter   hi  grace   hey  mom  i want to ask you a question   but i don't want you to freak out  okay   uh oh   forget it  i'll ask zach   no  no  no  what  all right  well   some girl said dad slept with a hooker my age  and i just     what  ma'am  you'll have to turn that off   they were playing the tape in the computer lab   and some girl said  her dad's a cop and he said one of the hookers  was a teenager   okay  first of all  they were all over 20 and second   where's the teacher   it's no big deal  mom  look  i've got homework   i'll talk to you later   what   last time i was in court was 13 years ago   wow  i was 12   thanks   the judge reaches into his pocket   pulls out a check  handing it to the plaintiff    i'm returning five grand and we're going to decide this    that's florrick's wife   alicia  my god   matan  remember  from the department christmas party   you're at stern  lockhart   gardner   yeah  first day   wow  oh   this is sandra pai  she's new   since peter   how's he doing  by the way   peter  fine   say hello for me  will you   look at all this   you're going to bury us   i don't know how you do it  alicia   i'd be huddled up in a ball somewhere   well  back to work   good luck   where's diane   diane asked me to step in for her   jennifer  i'm alicia florrick   i'm one of the other lawyers with the firm   step in  for how long   for the retrial   oh  my god  all rise   ma'am   the criminal court  of cook county is now in session   the honorable judge richard cuesta presiding   be seated   okay  let's hear it   your honor  i just     your honor  just to refresh your memory   the accused was deemed a flight risk  due to an earlier custody hearing  in which she threatened to run off with her daughter   and yet just last week a jury deadlocked  on these murder charges six to six  mr  brody   now i know our new state's attorney  wants to look tough  but why are you fighting this   your honor  i just wanted to     the people are prepared to retry  this case right now  your honor   if mrs  florrick  is so intent on getting her client out   why doesn't she agree to a speedy trial   mrs  florrick  yes  your honor   the wife of the esteemed peter florrick   your husband and i never quite saw eye to eye  ma'am  your honor     mrs  florrick  don't talk   but if the prosecution thinks that this will in some way  prejudice me against your client   he is sorely mistaken   nice try  matan   so ms  lewis is granted  pretrial release  with electronic monitoring   she is restricted to temporary housing   attorney's offices  and transit in between   and given that this is a rerun   i'll set the trial date for the 25th   now  are we all happy  good   thank you   sure   sync by honeybunny   corrected by chamallow35  we had an amazing time   michael talked about missing his daughter   the life we had together   we were driving home  and  uh     we got a flat   he was getting out to fix it   and i saw     a red pickup truck   a man came up to michael   i didn't see the gun  until     michael   and i saw michael's face   it was  um     do you need to take a break   uh  no   just    if there was some water   sure   sonia  we need some water in here   it's going to be about five minutes   but then i've got to do his depo upstairs   okay  uh  tell me when you're done   you say this man ran to a red pickup truck here   and took off in this direction across the parking lot   there's a surveillance camera here   and the prosecution played it to make you look like a liar   i'm not lying   but there's no truck on the tape   and that's why you're facing a retrial now and not an acquittal   i think what kalinda is trying to say  jennifer     is  is it possible that you were mistaken  and that the car went this way    not that way   is that your daughter   they won't let me see her   michael's parents have custody   what am i going to do   you're going to take it one day at a time   we got you housing   you're going to go there   take a shower  take a nap   don't turn on the tv   you like reading   i'm going to get you some books   fiction is best   you won't feel like it  but put on nice clothes and makeup   force yourself to   not for court      for you   it's the superficial things that matter most right now   does it ever get easier   no   but you do get better at it   what   if you identify with too many clients  you burn out   why don't you tell me when i do something right  okay   sure   you go and interview the jurors  and i'll try to figure out how  a surveillance camera can lie   that's right  i was the jury foreman   and you don't mind answering a few questions for us  doctor   it'll help us refine the case for the retrial   no problem   i don't think you'll need much refining   your case was very strong  very logical   in fact  i'm not even sure why the other side went to trial   i voted for conviction right from the start   good   you    you mean  acquittal   no  conviction   but i'm with the defense   oh   she was lying about the pickup truck   she had the gunshot residue on her hands   can i ask you how many voted for conviction  from the start  sir   eleven  what   there was only one holdout   juror number nine   we argued with her for three days   but the judge polled the jury  and they deadlocked six to six   yes  well  the judge would only declare us deadlocked  if we were evenly split   so some of us agreed to change our vote  to not guilty just to get out of there   if it hadn't been for juror number nine  we would have convicted   she didn't convince us  she exhausted us   no tea for me  mrs  duretsky   suit yourself   so the other jurors  said you were a holdout  is that correct   mm hmm   they all thought they were so much smarter than me   my vote counted just as much as theirs  uh huh   what exactly in the defense's case convinced you   well  the whole thing  really   i tend to look at a person and size them up pretty quickly   that lady  i liked her   the defendant  jennifer   no  that lawyer lady   she never put on airs   i like that   just so i'm clear   the defense expert argued that the gunshot residue  on jennifer's hands came from the struggle   oh  so sweet  is that why you held out   oh  i don't know about that   i just tend to get a feeling   don't i  cyrus   hi  jackie   what's wrong  nothing's wrong   i was going through the laundry  and i think some of grace's school clothes  you would find inappropriate   we just moved away   grace has left all her friends  i need you to go easier on her   all i said was  i could take her shopping and help her find pants  that would make her look slimmer   she's at a perfectly healthy weight   i don't want her to have body image issues   she'll only have body image issues  if she keeps gaining weight   alicia   um  we'll talk about this when i get home later  okay   all right  bye   you know the new associate cary   the one in the brioni   what  i'm observant   yes  the one in the brioni   he said to me   may the best man win    what exactly does he mean by that   what he means is something  i thought we weren't making public   what   look  we only have one associate position open   so we agreed to hire two applicants  and in six months  decide which one to retain   so this is a contest between me and cary   it was either that or a cage match   i'm just happy your pro bono's going well   visiting hours are almost over   they said a visitor   i thought mom   i've been busy   it's good to see you   i need you to sign some things   okay   we didn't get everything we wanted on the house   it's a bad market to sell   i see that   we used most of it for your court costs   the rent will come out of my salary  and the kids are going to have  to stay in public school  how are they   mother says that she's helping out around the house   they're good   grace argues over clothes with your mother   and zach is using you to make friends at school   which i don't know if that's a healthy thing  or something worse   using me   funnyordie has a skit about you   it's cool  i guess   oh     here   alicia  i know this has been hard on you   but you have to believe me   i'm innocent     of the abuse of office charges   you think i give a damn about that  peter   they were playing a tape in grace's computer lab  of you sucking the toes of a hooker   you think i care about the small print  in your employment contract   come on  i was set up  the state attorneys     oh  come on  peter  i don't want to talk      i'm not going to fight   i didn't come here to fight   mom says you're on a case   congratulations   the fake carjacking  right   who's the judge   richard cuesta   you're kidding   he hates me   i know   visiting hours are now over   visiting hours are now over   you know there was something weird about that case  don't you   the lewis case   there was a rumor going around  that something got buried  pitted   what   evidence  or testimony   i should go   hey  listen   thanks for playing the breadwinner for a while   it's not going to last forever   the lawyers think the appellate court  is going to hear my case   if they overturn it  everything goes back to normal   it's time   peter   it's never going back to normal   as soon as the cops found gunshot residue  on jennifer's hands  they had their suspect   so what if they pitted everything else   and what if they didn't   arguments are cheap   what's that   page one of the crime lab summary   i was digging through discovery  look at the top corner   looks like a staple   it is a staple   and that's odd because      there's no page two   why do they need to staple  if there's no page two   you think the cops kept something out of the discovery  that pointed to another suspect   well  i think either they did or it would be helpful  in court to imply that they did   two days away from trial  and you're thinking of dropping the old strategy   diane barely convinced a cat lady to acquit   so  a pickup truck is seen racing  through a well lit  empty parking lot   how is a truck missed by that surveillance camera   mismarked surveillance tape   yeah   what are you doing   working   these are better than subpoenas   we just need to see how the surveillance system works   and we'll be out of your hair in five minutes   five minutes  uh huh   okay  it's down here   why did my husband fire you   he accused me of working two jobs   were you   oh  yeah   see  the computer automatically records the surveillance   marks it with date and time   is that the night of the murder  yeah   i mean  even if the computer did mismark it   i make an hourly tour of the lot   and i didn't see no pickup truck   look  that's me    can we get copies of these   sure   lanie   lanie    what   get me some disks   all right   your machine spit out an extra one   would you like it   oh   oh  what beautiful children   two kids  two grandkids   hey  lanie  how about those disks    is he always so charming   oh  he's just a lazy mall cop   he spends half the day surfing porn   and with night shift   he can't get his skinny ass out of his chair   i'm always waking him up in the morning   oh  men   i talked to peter  he said you dropped by   i did   i'm glad   he's hurting in there   he's very brave   but he's hurting   he needs you to forgive him  alicia   jackie   i spent 15 years doing his laundry   cleaning his house   never asking a single question  because i didn't think i had to   and he took everything i thought we had  and he just put it out there for everyone   he didn't want that   the press     oh  jackie   stop it  please  peter wasn't thinking of us   it takes time  alicia   give it time   any time i have right now is for them   i want her dead   me  too  just not quite yet   so why can't zach and i just watch ourselves   honey  she's only here a couple of hours a day   a couple very damaging hours   you'll heal   and change her ring tone   please state your name   cindy lewis   and you were married to the victim  for how long  mrs  lewis   two years until      thank you  and how would you describe  your husband's relationship with his first wife   well  most of the time it was fine  friendly even   but after the last custody hearing   michael was pretty worried about jenniger     objection  your honor   on what grounds   hearsay   nice try  mrs  florrick  i'll allow it   go ahead  mrs  lewis   um  he was worried jennifer was intent  on getting sole custody   thank you  mrs  lewis   your witness   now  mrs  lewis  you stated that michael was worried  about jennifer  yet in the week following     objection  your honor   sustained   in your testimony  mrs  lewis  you claimed  that jennifer wanted sole custody   but isn't it true      objection  sustained   keep trying  mrs  florrick  you'll hit on it   mrs  lewis  whose idea was it to have dinner   jennifer's or michael's   michael's   so wouldn't that suggest  that his attitude had changed towards      objection   sustained   thank you   now  detective briggs  the defense has referred  to three unsolved carjackings  in the neighborhood at that time   are you aware of this  i am   so why didn't you consider this incident  to be another in that series of carjackings   first of all  they were all luxury cars   one lexus and two bmws   the victim in this crime was driving a 2001 honda   and there was no clip on the fuel line   this is what the carjackers did to force the luxury cars over   that's right   but in the case of the honda  the victim pulled over  because he had a flat   yes  ma'am  there was a nail driven  into the front driver tire   i see  now  why is this something  a carjacker would never do  detective   it would defeat the purpose   i mean  how do you steal a car with a flat   your witness   it's not going well  is it   it's early   mrs  florrick   detective briggs  what is  the pit    excuse me   in police circles  what is  the pit    objection  your honor   on what grounds   on the grounds that    relevance   well  let us see how relevant this becomes   shall we  detective   the pit     the pit is police slang  for evidence thought irrelevant at a crime scene   so when an officer's referring to dropping something  in  the pit   or  pitting it   he refers to what   excluding it from the crime scene narrative   but that only applies to irrelevant details   we wouldn't exclude pertinent evidence   was anything pitted from the lewis crime      your honor  objection   evidence is logged in all the time  that proves irrelevant to the discovery   it's not an intent to deceive   it's an attempt to decipher facts   we don't even know if it is     and to blame the prosecution for not coming up with every  single possible detail   she's trying to build  a case on a staple    okay  okay  mrs  florrick   none of this was in the first trial   is it your intention to pursue a new defense   yes  your honor   counsel's trying to mislead the jury   she's implying there was police corruption   oh  shut up  matan   is she right  that's the question   did you bury something   we all know what's going on here   peter florrick was a corrupt  and convicted state's attorney   if evidence was buried  he buried it   and now she's benefiting from his knowledge   which still leaves you  with some pages missing here   i'll give you till monday  to produce them  along with any evidence they reference   then i'll rule on admissibility   and you  mrs  florrick   i'm not sure if you're being fed this stuff or you're doing it  on your own  but if it's the former   you're walking a very narrow  ethical line here  you understand that   yes  your honor   the directive was simple   follow the strategy of the first trial   instead  you're pushing for evidence  that might not even help your case   i interviewed the first jury  and they  voted 11 to one to convict   excuse me  that's not true  it was evenly split   no  half the jurors switched their votes  when they couldn't get  a troubled juror to deliberate   so  i used my judgment to change strategies   and was it your judgment not to update us   she's a junior associate  who doesn't think she's a junior associate   her husband was a state's attorney   she lived in highland park   it's not just teaching an old dog new tricks   it's teaching an entitled dog new tricks   come on  diane  the problem is she's catching evidence  that you overlooked   i've seen you mentor these women  until they start competing with you   and then you    what  excuse me   i say we reprimand alicia and put cary in as first chair   thank you   that's her  isn't it   sonia  can you      alicia florrick's office   one moment  please   jennifer  pick up   hello   hi  baby  hi   i miss you so much   alicia   it's dog hair   the pitted evidence   i talked to a friend at the crime lab   gave me a preview of the evidence   a preview   it's dog hair found on the victim's clothes   cops pitted it  because they found dog hair at michael's residence  and thought it was the same   but it's not   it's from an italian greyhound   neither michael nor jennifer had greyhounds   there's also a chemical on the hair   alco ectolin      a lotion for muscle and joint paint   that's the chemical number   no  his cell number   i agreed to drinks   so we're looking  for an arthritic greyhound owner   we  i hear you're being bumped to second chair   when   end of tomorrow   cary's being transitioned in   and he'll go back  to the first trial strategy   wow   it's not a good year for him   the all star point guard is currently suing  his ex girlfriend for damages   hoping the judge can finally determine  whether this case was fact or fantasy   you know her simply as  amber    the young woman who brought down  bad boy chicago state's attorney peter florrick   though she says she wants to leave the scandal far behind   celebrity call girl amber madison  has decided to write a memoir about her time with florrick   in this exclusive interview with inside edition     do you really have to work   yeah  ten more minutes  zach  i need your computer   mom  i just raised my wanted level   yeah  i'm happy for you  honey   when peter's father was on the illinois court   he never brought  a single case home  not once   he was a judge  jackie  i'm a junior associate  zach    i need you to play  these two computer disks side by side   can you set up my computer next to yours   hey  how's your sister   she still fighting with grandma   what is it   it's video  of the night of the murder   like faces of death   mm   mom  i've seen worse   you're adorable   i'm not   yes  you are   zach  freeze it   what  what is it   it's proof   this is at 11 03 the night of the murder  mr  north   and    that's you  making your hourly circuit of the lot  correct   yes  that's correct   and you saw no pickup truck  no carjacker racing past   nothing the defendant  claims she saw   that's correct   thank you   nothing further  your honor   mrs  florrick   can we have the monitors in  please   thank you   state's attorney's here   now  mr  north     they're worried she's getting  the stuff from her husband   here are three images   the middle is the image of the surveillance  from the 15th  the night of the murder   and the one over there on the left is the image  from the 14th  the night before the murder  and the one  on the right is from the 16th  the night after the murder   can you see the dates on those   uh  yes  i can   so  as you said before  there you are  the night of the murder  at 11 03   making your circuit of the lot   and    there you are the night before the murder  and the night after  doing the same thing   it must get old  um  no  ma'am   my job doesn't pay as much as yours  but i still love it   okay  good   now  mr  north   let's fast forward  shall we    and there   what do you see   nothing  no   it's right there    maybe you need to move in a little closer   oh  it's a shopping bag  it looks like a shopping bag   actually  it is   it's a plastic shopping bag   it was a very windy night that night  and it blew across  the lot at 11 48  your honor  objection   what does this have to do with anything  beats me   but i'm interested  aren't you  mr  brody   overruled   okay  so let's fast forward  the other two monitors       the night before the murder and the night after the murder      to the same time code   here's the 14th     and the 16th   what do you see   um    i don't know   i think you do know  sir   either you have a plastic bag  that blows across your lot every night at 11 48   or these are duplicates of the same tape   no  it     it's not wh    what it looks like   i understand  sir   you didn't willfully mislead the police   yeah  that's correct   no  it's just that it gets cold out there  and sometimes  you don't make the circuit of the lot  yes   so on the nights that you don't go out   you don't record the actual surveillance image   you set your computer up  to duplicate the night before   just in case your manager checks in   is that correct   yes   just so i'm clear   there is no recording the night of the murder   and you were never there to see or not see  the pickup truck or the carjacker   i'm sorry   uh  yes   no further questions   so  you're wondering whether demolishing  the key prosecution witness  didn't just save your ass as first chair      nice work  by the way      thanks       but was enough for reasonable doubt   you know what hurts you   nail in the tire  yep   and the old honda   it just doesn't feel like a carjacking   it feels like a murder  made to look like a carjacking   what if i don't fight it   what  agree that it was just a murder   then the jury needs a suspect   it's late   it's like old times   evidentiary procedure   the mock trial   you remember that   how could i forget   did we lose  that one  yeah   hi  hi   um  mrs  florrick  i just want to say congratulations   i heard you did well in court   thanks  sonia   sonia   heading out   yeah  i got a breakfast meeting with clients   what   something just doesn't seem right   michael has dinner  with his first wife   right  he tells jennifer  he misses her  he missed their old life together   right   what does cindy think about it   the second wife   cindy thinks some unhappy thoughts   jury liked her   get them not to   what did you get on cindy's brother   these are his employment records   good  what about the lab report   here  but they're gonna object the whole way   you'll need to just string together some implications    mrs  florrick   you have a moment   okay   i don't think we've ever met before   i'm glenn childs   we've met   you know he's using you  don't you   peter blames me for his downfall   he's using you to get to me   how do you figure   mrs  florrick  please   he told you about the pitted trace evidence   don't make yourself collateral damage here   for your own sake   mr  childs   the day you leaked that sex tape to the press  and forced me to shield my children  from every cable news station that played it  in a 24 hour rotation   that was the day i became collateral damage   if you're worried about my husband  mr  childs   you've obviously never made a woman  angry before   well  good luck in court   mrs  lewis  did you and the deceased  sign a prenuptial agreement   uh  yes   for tax purposes   so if the deceased were to divorce you  let's say   in order to reunite with  his first wife    objection   sustained   if the deceased were to divorce you   you would be cut off from his premarital savings   is that correct  objection   relevance  sustained   move it along  mrs  florrick   mrs  lewis  you stated in your testimony  that you were in miami  at the time of the shooting visiting family   so the police never suspected or questioned you   of the murder  no  of course not   what about your brother   objection  your honor  come on   this whole line of questioning is a smokescreen   mr  brody  why don't we wait  for a whiff of smoke before we call it a screen  please   i'll allow   the police never questioned your brother   isn't that correct  mrs  lewis   well  they had no reason to   because he lived in miami   because danny had nothing to do with this   mrs  lewis  the judge  has admitted into evidence the buried     strike that       the previously unreleased trace evidence   he has also admitted into evidence  the crime lab's finding  that these greyhound hairs were covered  in a chemical compound called alco ectolin   have you heard of this  sorry  the chemical  no   no  neither had i   it is a lotion   it is a lotion that is used at dog racing tracks to ease     objection  not in evidence  sustained   and you might want to stay standing  mr  brody   i have a feeling we're nearing  your smokescreen   mrs  lewis   isn't it a fact  that a year ago at the time of the murder   your brother worked at a dog track   objection   sustained   no further questions   you're not just making this up   come on  it's a stern  lockhart tradition   your first jury trial    shot of tequila   let's go   okay   yeah  i just made that up   sounded good  though   didn't it   how long do you think they'll stay out   oh  i stopped guessing about juries a while ago   how long were they out with your husband   six hours   yeah   you know what i don't get   why you stood by him   i would've stuck  a knife in his heart   i always thought i would  too   but when i heard about those other scandals   the other wives     i thought     how can you allow yourself to be used like that   and then it happened   and i was     unprepared   hello   yes   thanks   jury's in   well  mrs  florrick   chicago homicide has decided  to reopen its investigation into the murder of michael lewis   detective briggs   doing an admirable amount of due diligence   has confirmed that cindy lewis's brother danny  had access to his employer's pickup truck  the week of the murder   and the dog hairs  admitted into evidence  match those found at his workplace   so our state's attorney   in his radiant wisdom   has decided to withdraw the charges against your client  and pursue a case against mrs  lewis's brother   isn't that right  mr  brody   all i need is a yes or no   yes   good   then we're done here   thank you  thank you so much   hi  jackie   no  it just went a little late  that's all

need to pick up a few things   and i'll be home soon   all right  jackie  i don't know if i've said this   but thank you    for stepping up   of course i would  why wouldn't i   i'll see you soon
