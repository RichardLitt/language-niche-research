madam vice president     how are you    i've got a little bit of the bug   but other than that  i'm good   i'm sorry to hear that  well  drink plenty of liquid   well  that's sort of a stupid thing to say  isn't it   'cause you can't drink a solid  can you   soup   well  soup is solids suspended in liquid  so it qualifies as a liquid   see that  gary was a major at u v a  in science   so occasionally that's of use   so we'll see you guys this afternoon     great  nice to see you    so nice to see you   take care  soup   press release for selina approval     hey  mike  your perspiration      i know     i'm just saying    can't help it  sign of a healthy body     there are products available  mike    i tried them all   sweat right through 'em  i got very large pores   hey

it   hey  dan  can you get some more oxygen in here  please   yeah   this thing is completely useless  by the way   can move more air by farting   i'm sure you can  ma'am   those don't open  those are anti suicide windows   they only put those in after you started working here  right  gary   so  here's the deal   clean jobs in the bag  so that's good   but we've got filibuster reform talks this afternoon that we've got to deal with   so let's nail this  okay  everybody     let's seize the agenda    you're making it sound like a coup   i'm not gonna say i'm not enjoying the president being in south africa   god  wearing some kind of shawl at a lion sanctuary   did you see that photo  it's unbelievable   anyway  i'm just talking about redefining     dan  what was that phrase that you used in our meeting     what was that     two point me     two point me   that's exactly right  i love that   ma'am  your two hour with glen yates just canceled   he's got the bug   all right  well  that means i've got two hours free   let's capitalize on this  you guys   c'mon  let's go somewhere  let's meet the public     you want to normalize it    yes  exactly   i want to meet some regular normals  where we gonna find them   photo op with the normals and the normalistas     there's a book fair      oh  my god        in adams morgan    too dull  no   you're not gonna get a good photo holding a book     you need something active    it's like kids read or something   kids are unpredictable  they wet their pants     keep it simple  keep it simple    yeah  not good   ma'am  frozen yoghurt  all right  is huge in this town right now   it's hot out  let's go to a store   there's one that i know that i go to all the time on u street   it's owned by three generations of african americans   i mean there's a narrative built right in   excellent  perfect  done deal   we can totally normalize with those guys   that's what we're gonna do  make it happen  guys   all right  we're going to a yoghurt shop   when was this  two point me  meeting with selina   oh  are you still tracking my every move   i thought we agreed to move on   move on from what  we dated for like a week   it was like getting of a mild food poisoning   look  amy  i am genuinely sorry that my arrival here  has caused you to become so self conscious and gain a little weight   fuck point you     are we early    yeah   i want to get there early   i want the people who are on time to think that they're late     oh  mind games  love it    yeah   i didn't appreciate the reference  to my potential suicide earlier  i'm not a joke   no  you're the guy with the big bag of lip balm  gary   you're fucking kissinger   every single thing you say to me is emasculating     do you realize that    yes   i think that senator doyle still might go cold on sponsoring this bill   well  've got to warm him up  'cause we need his support on   junk the jams  or whatever they're calling it now      unclog the backlog      unclog the backlog    i do a serious job   i'm next to the veep more than any other human being   you are distantly orbiting her   i'm her moon   so would you take a bullet for the veep  gary     oh  my god    no  no  no   because  you know  you're gonna be right in the line of fire   it's not my job  i would help her if she was down   right  with the lip balm if she got shot in the lips   that could crack 'em pretty bad   great  we missed the elevators   doyle is essential  he's like the russian doll of the senate   comes with little senators inside of him   hey  gary  can i have a kleenex     where are my people    oh  here they go   come on   don't shoot  don't shoot  please don't shoot   shoot him  you can shoot him   where the hell did you go     dan  you're gonna have to go in the limo    oh  sure  yeah   ma'am  i think we should start ramping up the whole launch  of  two point you  right now   you know  just kind of a little hint out there  about what clean jobs is gonna be     yeah  i think the same thing    i can get right on this   leon west has given me his private cell   oh  good  all right  let's set up 10 minutes  of face time with him after the doyle meeting   copy that  i'm on it   you know what  i'm nervous about doyle     he can be a real hogfucker    he's a stickler   wait a minute  hand sanitizer  ma'am   you know what i heard  senator doyle wears pantyhouse   oh  really   no  but now that you have that image  he's not that scary   oh  listen  tell dan  to start working on the yoghurt store  okay   wait a minute  gary   gary  this is way too much   what do you want me to do  what   okay  let's not do that again  all right   andrew  how are you   madam vice president  a pleasure   oh  come on  selina  please   well  let's play this one by the book     eric  of course    we just saw him this morning   yeah  you spoke about soup   so    should we get to it     let's get to it    let's    okay     i'm gonna lighten this up a little bit    please  please do   hi  everybody   well  we have lots to talk about   yup  let's do some talking     you need me to sponsor this bill    yes  i do   i do need you to do that  and i want to know what you need from me   what do you need  you need some non earmark earmarks   you need support during your reelection campaign   i just won't be photographed eating a hot dog  or any other phallic food   oops  that was mistake     really don't need any of that  ma'am    okay   what i need is very simple   actually  what i would like     what the hell  eric   what was that  what just happened   he was gonna seze on you and i blocked it   i am so sorry  madam vice president   that is nice work  eric  i mean  you want to take another shot   i don'think we're drenched at this end of the table     oh  my god  i'm sorry    that scared me to death   he can be a gold plated fucking shit gibbing     he works for you    i mean  he almost sneezed in your face   i think it's treason  let me get you a cup of coffee   i would love a cup of coffee   oh  my goodness   listen  i've got this covered now   okay  why don't you go round up a few more senators     okay  you sure    mm hmm  filibuster smackdown     that's what i call it    all right  dig it   oh  wow  i'm shaking from that  are you guys   no  we perfectly understand senator murray's reservations   yeah  of course  she must be guided by her conscience   no hard feelings whatsoever     uh  dan    yeah   i hope you don't take this the wrong way   but can i just say  you kinda look like an asshole   hello  did you tell them  amy  oh  come on  come on     i took a bullet for the veep    how'd you take a bullet  gary   it was a sneeze bullet  right in the face   saved selina from the bug  pure instinct   it was like a dirty bomb and i    bam     dived on it  mmm   hey  hey  it's the flunkies   and people say you're bad at your jobs     you here to spy  jonah    i'm not here to spy   i work at the white house  so i can just walk in and say    i'm from the white house  what the fuck are you doing    what  you work at the white house     oh  my god  can i blow you    uh  yes  you can   i will meet you out in the hallway in a few seconds   sure  i'll get a stepladder   anyway  i work for the white house  what the fuck are you doing   trying to figure out what flavor frozen yoghurt the veep should get   mint   it implies freshness  trust  traditional values     fascinating    this is one of my areas   yeah  food choices  seriously  put it up   oh  swirl  racial harmony and crossing the aisle   so is cookies and cream   white house  this is jonah   okay  watch your head   oh  fuck you  no  not you  sir   very excited about this filibuster reform bill   that is great to hear   if you can get a senate reform bill  through the place it's designed to reform     that would be amazing    yeah   i mean  that would be like  persuading a guy to fist himself   jesus christ   tell me  mr  flatterbox   what do you need from me  really   well  i need you to keep oil guys  off the clean jobs task force     don't do this to me  andrew    i'm going to do it to you  yup   this is a nuanced area   you are not in the pocket of oil   no  i'm not in the pocket of oil  no   so we can make this work     i'm eager to be constructive    right   it seems to me that somehow we can make this happen  then i'd     deal  you keep oil guys off clean jobs   i will sponsor the filibuster bill   well  we can work     this out     great  terrific    wonderful     coffee    hmm     cup    oh  uh huh  sure   gary  senator doyle's guy looks like he's dying   if i were you  i would go straight to the pharmacy and take one of everything   i'm gonna have a blowout if i walk to the pharmacy   that's what i'm worried about   if you're gonna shit your pants  i don't want you here     hey    i think i did the right thing   but i just need you to confirm that i did the right thing   i said something to someone   what exactly did you say  ma'am  and to who   to whom   senator doyle said that he would sponsor the bill     oh   if we keep oil off of clean jobs   and there was an implication  perhaps       you didn't say yes    no   i didn't say  yes    i said  yeah    okay  well  we told oil we'd put one of their guys on clean jobs   that's why we got away with the cutlery tweet   i know  i know     she's aware of that    okay  i was charmed by doyle   he's got that little twinkle in his eye   he was talking about fisting people   he just niced me  i got niced   and where were you  amy  by the way   no  you said you had it covered   no  i didn't have it covered  and it's your job to know  that if i say i have it covered  i don't have it covered and you cover me   i need you all to make me have not said that   i need you to have    make me unsaid it   let's just slow down for a second   make two columns  one with filibuster  one with clean jobs   because now they are versus   doyle gives us filibuster  so put him there   okay  but oil gives us clean jobs     clean jobs is your legacy    yes     hold on a second    what   what if we put an ex oil guy on the task force   you see what i'm saying   someone who's cozy with oil  but not active oil     former oil    that's lying   creative semantics   well  that's a creatively semantic way of saying we're lying   still creative   oh  hey  jonah  jonah  jonah   that we    yeah  that we might like   what i'm saying is that we go with what i just said   the  um  the     jamaican rum flavor   that's a really strong flavor choice   i mean  it's unexpected   it's funky  it's kind of sexual   yeah  i don't want to make too quick of a decision   let's consider other flavors     like vanilla    oh  c'mon  vanilla is a girl's flavor   no  i have no choice here  amy   because i was backed into a corner   so other flavors aren't an option for me  okay   perhaps if you had done your job better   then  oh  i could choose vanilla or chocolate  or fucking blueberry with fucking sprinkles on it   but that's not an option for me  okay     that flavor's not an option for me    okay   you know  i think jamaican rum is a great choice   and your passion about it is gonna sell it   i'm confused  are we still talking about yoghurt here     we're gonna go with dan's idea    okay   jamaican rum is where we are headed     all right  jamaican rum  mon    okay   that's good   maybe we don't need the accent     hey  dan    yeah   leon west is down at front security for you   leon west  leon west is here for you   the journalist  the beltway butcher   don't you worry for one second  all right     i'm gonna take him to the yoghurt store    i'm not worried   because you are gonna get rid of him  you're gonna kill him  and you're gonna do life for murder and i never have to see your face again   you know  if i wash my hands anymore   the bones are gonna come through   hey  where is dan   he's at the yoghurt store   gary  are you all right  are you getting the bug   no  i'm    oh     okay  you're not gonna like this    what   white house press guys have just been in touch   postus wants to announce clean jobs task force  next week when he is back from africa   we now go over live to the vice president for her pissed off reaction   come on  he wants to announce it next week     yeah    okay  it's my policy     he's sliding in    who knows  yeah  that feels like a slide     this happens every time  does it not    yes     it's like charlie brown and the football    yeah   we're gonna have to rewind this  okay   because i've got dan backgrounding it right now     what  you asked dan to do that    yeah  i did   i asked him because of the whole  veep point two  thing    two point me    the  two point me  thing   now you have to call him and tell him to stay quiet   and you've got to go down to that yoghurt store   you didn't just roll your eyes  did you     no  ma'am    'cause it sure looked like it to me   i can't stand that passive aggressive stuff   this whole day is turning apocalyptic now   okay   okay   leon  hi     just right in here    okay  dan  a very obscure rendezvous   so you either have a very hot story for me   or you're going to shoot me   i have got a story for you   things are about to get very veep tastic     mr  egan  good to see you    anthony   how are you  sir   we are very excited about the
