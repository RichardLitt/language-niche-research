we were suspects or something   do you think we looked guilty   why would we  we haven't done anything wrong   except lie about the jenna thing   we promised we'd never bring up the jenna thing again  remember   it never happened   have you found a way to forget   i still wake up sometimes in the middle of the night   it was an accident   it's medicinal   cramps   i don't get it   how does  a  know

and just clam up   she'd so kill me if i told you   she's dead   ali was seeing someone that summer   i knew she was keeping something from me     from us   well  why didn't she want us to know   he was an older boy  and he had a girlfriend   who was it   she never told me his name   that's only half the secret   it's more than you ever got from her   how is that ali told us nothing  and we told her everything   because she made us feel like we were part of something special   we were   i miss that   me too   i miss ali   i can't believe you still wear that   ali still wears hers   wore   when ali didn't come home that night   i knew something terrible must have happened   but there was always some part of me  that imagined someday she'd just show up   yeah   i used to think that maybe she'd just     run off with some guy   she was laying on a beach somewhere   or getting a tan out by the pool with that hot lifeguard   ohh  yeah    what was his name   who cares    save me           can you keep it       swear this one you'll save      better lock it in your pocket      taking this one to the grave      if i show you then i know you      won't tell what i said      'cause two can keep a secret      if one of them is dead    sync by yescool   that's the last of the milk   it's on the list      over the area right now with a lot of warm air   but we've got a cold front moving in from the west right here behind me   newscaster  in other news   rosewood detective darren wilden  held a press conference this morning   wilden  the coroner did release his findings this morning   and although alison dilaurentis' body  did show signs of a blunt force head trauma   the cause of her death was suffocation   are you okay going to school today   yeah  i'll be fine   i don't want to think about what the police are saying   and you shouldn't either   try to remember alison as the beautiful girl you knew   i'm really sorry  mom   for what   the cop   it's over  okay   we won't be seeing him again   is that amber rose   it's a good color for you   i had to look twice to make sure that was hanna   right   that was some funeral dress   her mother didn't get that from curvy girl

much sleep   my mom found another one of alison's boxes in the basement   there were pictures of her in my room   her room   she's everywhere   and that poster   someone should take those posters down   it hurts way too much to look at them   emily     i'm so sorry     i am behind    is everything all right   mom  this is maya st  germain   oh  maya  hi  hi   well  i would say welcome to the neighborhood  but     it's kind of hard when your backyard's a crime scene   still   it's where people come to be close to her   they light candles and leave teddy bears   i get it  but it still feels like her house   sure   i can understand how you're not sleeping   you know  maya  why don't you just spend a few days with us   you could sleep in emily's room   thank you  mm hmm   female vocalist    i'm the kind of girl      who listens      you never know what you might be missing    nice    so i hear you're gunning for varsity captain   well  i have a shot  so     if a hastings has a shot  she

  yeah  of course   i'd like to transfer out of your class   can you come inside for a minute  please   yeah   i understand where you're coming from   i just    wish that you could stay in the class   this isn't an easy decision   but i feel like it's the right thing to do   i can keep my feelings in check   i can't   and even if i could  i don't want to   it's too hard to sit in this room every day and call you mr  fitz   okay  i can't pretend like i don't know you   so     will you sign it   are you sure   yeah  i'm    i'm sure   thank you   mm hm   okay   i am all for boob jobs   but when

hastings   hanna marin       wait   it's from  a     dead girls walking     so let's see     you thought you heard her scream   i i said that  yeah   and when you three woke up  in the barn  alison was gone   and so was spencer   yes  i woke up before them   and i realized that ali was missing  so     so you went looking for her   that's what happened   i got that   so  what's up  was this a slumber party  or      is this an interrogation   no  just a routine follow up   why did you guys all fall asleep   i guess we were tired   tired   really   is that how you remember it  hanna   yeah   yeah  you guys were tired   look  we've told you everything we know   just like we did the night she went missing   i know  and you see  the thing is   it's almost exactly what you said last year    almost like it was rehearsed   like spencer said   we've told you everything we know   he knows we're lying   lying is not a crime   it is when you're giving false statements to the police   it's called obstruction of justice   oh  please  we lied about drinking   but the truth that matters is we don't know anything  about what happened to ali that night   we also know about someone  who might have wanted to hurt her   we should have told the police the truth about jenna's accident  the night it happened   i wanted to  remember   we had a chance to do more than just tell the truth   we had a chance to stop ali   but we didn't   and telling the police now about what happened to jenna  isn't going to make her see again   it'll just ruin our lives   oh  my god  she's back in school too   jenna   hey  it's   it's aria   do you    want to come sit with us   sure  okay  thank you   so you're gonna be between hanna and emily   and spencer's right across from you   jenna  thank you   yeah  and here's a chair   so     this would be alison's chair  right   no  we're not even sitting at that table   you know  she came to visit me in the hospital after the accident   alison did   mm hm   everyone misunderstood alison   but i knew exactly who she was   when did you get back  jenna   we heard that you were in philadelphia   a school for the    visually impaired   you can say  blind   spencer   it's okay  it's not a dirty word   wow   it's so quiet   you guys used to be the fun table   what happened to you girls    male vocalist    we like to watch you laughing      picking insects off plants      no time to think of consequences      show yourself      take only what you need from it    look at this     i see you   oh  my god  i can't believe it   who was it  ali  what did you see   he was in that tree  spying on us   i am so creeped out  who was it   it was that perv  toby cavanaugh   are you sure  yes  i'm sure   he was right there   i bet he saw us all naked   should we tell someone   i mean  we could   but i have a better idea     are we sure he's not in there   he's not  okay   you've got the lighter  right  spencer   let's wait a second   what  emily   i don't want to do this  fine   go back  you're on your own   okay  maybe emily's right   we should just call the cops  they'll take care of it   where's the fun in that   girls  toby cavanaugh is a freak   and we need to teach him a lesson   if he thinks he can come and spy on us  while we're in your bedroom  emily   he needs to know that his little domain  is no longer a safe little hideout   who knows what he does in there all day  that little freak   are you sure that it was toby   yes  and it's a stink bomb  for god's sakes   we're not nuking the place  now  let's do it   give me the lighter
