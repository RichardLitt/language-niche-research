submachine guns   insurgents would have used ak 47 with 7 62 ammo     has more of a  crack    contractors shot them up  all right   you i d 'd the weapon from the gunshot sound   it has a very distinctive sound   castleman security is hard core  folks   a billion dollar company   they got fat government contracts everywhere we got troops   that's charles dufort  c e o   he's very paranoid and very professional   i want to get this clear right now   this is a private army you're talking about taking on   they got their own intel assets   they got a lot of trigger pullers   yes  and lobbyists in every office in washington  d c   the problem with a cover up  is all the paperwork it takes to keep the lies straight   internal e mails  memos   exactly     so      let's go to work   so  we steal the evidence and threaten to expose them     blackmail    ah  yes     but just enough blackmail to pay for perry's rehab     maybe a couple of million more in damages   never hold up in court   ah  but that's why corporal perry is lucky   he doesn't have lawyers  he has thieves   hardison   next time  i wear the suit   dufort's here  i'll make contact   see what you can squeeze out of him   parker  hardison  time to hit his office   i i got to go back to the office   i i just remembered something   what   i just remembered gravity     and the squishiness of all my manly bits   i

defense contractor     charles dufort    oh   executive orders doesn't work for the u s  government   yet   perhaps we could do something about that   yes  well  um  it was very nice to meet you   now

get an rfid card to eliot   my company's focused on meeting senators   but i'm thinking congressmen   you know the great thing about congressmen   will get one elected   but then  once they're in   the incumbency rate is over 95    so you can get  on an average    in these uncertain times   buying a united states congressman  is one of the best investments a corporation can make   ohh  i just threw up in my mouth a little bit   i'm a professional criminal  and i find that disturbing        well      no  overthrowing the government is too harsh a way to describe it   we just help them along   it was a                               shouldn't be too hard to get out and wash   oh    oh  this is the first day i've worn it   thank you   let me see if i can get someone to help you with that

much   i got all of perry's medical records     sure  that's    that's pretty normal   but i've got psych evaluations  high school records   they're reading his e mails   tapping his phones   i've got surveillance photos of perry here from the hospital yesterday   why are they spending so much money watching our guy   i mean  the investigations of the shooting were done months ago   see those guys   private contractors   because it's not about the shooting   the cover up has nothing to do with the shooting   it's about the trucks   congressman   uh  yes   your support on the next appropriations bill would be very helpful   we've already earmarked the no bid contracts for castleman     they deserve it    nobody's perfect   look at all the trouble they had with that shooting in najaf   i'm sorry   i don't really follow that sort of news   i just review the contracts   of course   excuse me   parker  hardison  bug out  go back to the office   we're going to the hospital   you need to

they're not looking me in the eye   men only really look a woman in the eye  when they're making the effort to lie to her   well  you can't argue with that   noted and filed   all right  jenkins is dufort's pet congressman   let's see if we can get him to bit  the best way to get two people to reveal a secret     get them to turn on each other   may i put that away for you   that didn't sound

american companies     like castleman    like castleman   and they support  uh  the country   well  i'm here because congressman calloway wanted me to let you know  that he's open to discussions now that  congressman jenkins has gone soft on you   jenkins al delivers   jenkins told my boss  to his face     that he's tired of covering for you   we've backed him for years   well  jes wanted my boss to meet this woman  from a british company     eh   uh      executive orders   i didn't pick you at random  congressman   castleman can be a fickle friend   rumor has it they're looking for some fresh blood   i'll tell you what   if your earmarks and your no bid contracts  are still in that appropriations bill        but if they're not   well  congressman calloway would be open to enjoying the same favors  that jenkins has enjoyed for all these years   but of course  jenkins has new friends now   you should look out for the signs  congressman     missed phone calls     no more little favors   those are the same signs that your wife is cheating on you   that's right   and what am i supposed to do when that happens   play the field   thanks very much for coming  tommy   pleasure   congressman jenkins is very careful   irect bribes  but he's renovating his house   and so far  he's received over  600 000 worth of work  for a little over 50 grand   castleman owns the contracting company  huh   i mean  he's going through like three shell companies  but  yeah   this man loves his house   just check out his web browsing habits  look here   you see  the man spthree weeks picking

congressional floor called the hopper   a wooden    whoa  whoa  a wooden    a wooden box     a wooden box    wood   oh  we can put a man on the moon   but all our laws go into a wooden box   what we need to do is  we need to get dufort  to believe that jenkins is abandoning him   that jenkins submitted the appropriations bill  that doe have any of the usual contracts for castleman   which means that we have to put our own pages into the bill   that means the only place that we could get at it wo    ahh  okay               i mean  break a law  everybody's done that     my mama's done that

listen to them     this is your contractor's problem   oh  please  let's not pretend   you pulled all our earmarks from the appropriations     there's about an hour of this  but here's the high point   somebody screwed up  i've always been there for you   i called manila   i cleared customs for you in los angeles   and that was a risk   now  after that  there's    it's     well  whatever you call the  rich guys on telephones  version of makeup sex   but now we know   castn makes a thousand shipments a month   but one shipped thromanila  right after the shooting   linked to phone records om the congressman   their shipments come through here   now  somewhere in this madness is container 541   it's currently sitting at the port of los angeles   what's in it   no idea  but it's moving in two days     heading to the main castleman storage facility in kansas   now  that     that's why they tried to hit perry  right there  that's it   yeah  wanted to tie up all the loose ends  before they tuck this one away at home base   what do you ship in a crate from iraq   oh  boy   something worth killing for   port of los angeles  how's security   dockyard entrance is no problem   there it is

frustrates you   position one  what's your status      just done walking the perimeter   copy that  i'm on my way   what do you think is in there   artifacts from baghdad museums   maybe some from the saddam palaces   no  i bet it's weapons   a lot of back alley arms dealing going on in a war zone   money's good  too   hey  line of sight   you shouldn't be away from that container   something's wrong with the webcam   get some men up therep and fix that webcam   i want it working in an hour  move   okay   that's worth killing for   ultraviolet checks out  paper checks out   the watermarks  the ink  it all checks out   there's a whole container of it  from iraq of all places   it's got to be counterfeit   no  it's real   it feels zeal   hey  what do you got going on  you and hardison   what is it  like a creepy contest   i don't know  what is it   200   300 million in u s  currency   what's it doing in iraq   we sent it there   what   beginning of the iraq war   my old company helped insure  the largest currency transfer in history   billions and billions in 1s  5s  and 20s  all cash   sent to iraq for reconstruction   bribes   as needed    9 billion went missing   wait  billion with a  b     9 billion of u s  taxpayer money just     disappeared   castleman gets a cut of the booty   the day they go to move it   real soldiers  they see the transfer   one of the contractors spooks  starts shooting   yeah  but corporal perry didn't see anything   well  they don't know that   but castleman's a billion dollar company   why would they even care about this cash   because it's cash   you know  money is money  that's one thing   cash is a whole other thing   for all the money in the economy   there's only about  500 in cash for every american  that's it   untraceable small bills     perfect for slush funds  or  um     improvements for a u s  congressman   small time donors  you know  for re election   no electrotrail   it's money laundering   how so   all right  well  castleman uses the illegal cash  to re elect his congressman   congressman gets him no bid contracts for government jobs   and then the government        pays for his services with legal money   and there's the circle right there   they turned the entire u s  government into a money laundering scam     that's right       i'm impressed   i never thought i'd say this  ever
