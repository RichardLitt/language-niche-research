sooner or later  the people you love let you down   and here's where it ends up  sleazy men  cocktail waitresses        cheap motels on the wrong side of town        and a soon to be ex spouse wanting a bigger piece of the settlement pie   that's where i come in   forty dollars an hour is cheap compared to the financial security        sordid photography can secure for you        your offspring  your next lover   but do us a favor if it's you in there  dispense with the cuddling   this motel tryst  it is what it is  make it quick   the person sitting in the car across the street might have a calculus exam in five     make that four hours  and she can't leave until she gets the money shot    well  this can't be good   car trouble  miss   this is my school  if you go here        your

you're my volunteer   pope   an essay on man   epistle one   hope springs eternal in the human breast  man never is  but always to be blest  the soul  uneasy and confin'd from home  rests and expatiates in a life to come  and what do you suppose pope meant by that     life's a bitch until you die    okay  thank you  ms  mars        for that succinct and somewhat inappropriate response   i think what pope's saying is that the thing that keeps us powering        through life's defeats is our faith in a better life yet to come   random locker searches   it's the latest tactic the administration has adopted in their losing war on drugs   except the searches aren't really random   i know when they're gonna happen before vice principal clemmons does   veronica mars  this should be good   veronica  will you please open your locker   buster   this is a little embarrassing   i used to sit there  at that table   it's not like my family met the minimum net worth requirement   my dad didn't own his own airline like john enbon's        or serve as ambassador to belgium  like shelly pomroy's        but my dad used to be the sheriff  and that had a certain cachet   let's be honest  though  the only reason i was allowed past the velvet ropes        was duncan kane  son of software billionaire jake kane   he used to be my boyfriend   then one day  with no warning  he ended things   and let's not forget logan echolls   his dad makes 20 million a picture   you probably own his action figure   every school has an obligatory psychotic jackass   he's ours     you okay

dad's office  duncan's mom   she hates me almost as much as she adores her son   veronica mars     my dad's with a client    apparently   that's okay  i'm happy chatting with you     like i said  my dad's with a client    i heard you   your dad's tracking bail jumpers half the time        and yet  somehow  all the cases that come in here still get handled     how is that    we're efficient   very efficient   look  i'm just gonna leave this file here open on your desk        and if you decide to take a look at it  cool   one of my clients  loretta cancun  dances at the seventh veil     classy    these are my people  v   she was busted for vandalism  taking a baseball bat        to the washing machine that stole her quarters     and johnnie cochran was booked    i make no apologies   i like this case  it's tawdry   cancun says the seventh veil has an interesting way        of keeping their liquor license  despite their rather lax id policy   she wants to make a deal   if your dad has time  he should look into it   don't get the wrong idea  mr  mars  i don't like you   i hate the fact that i'm here   but i do know if anyone will be dogged and resourceful        in this matter  it'll be you   don't call me at home  i'll call you   and i'll need it right away   hi   sure  she's a bitch  but can you blame her   after all  dad did try to send her husband to jail for life     how was school    if you think we're gonna talk        about my day and not the fact that celeste kane was in your office        you're deluded    you're making good grades   kane's got something on the side  doesn't he   say what you want about real cheese   i am a fan of the orange powder packet stuff   my grades are fine  and i like the orange powder too        but can we talk about mrs  kane   yes  she thinks he's seeing someone  late nights  motel matches  the usual   sexual appetite     gone    did you take the case     we need the money    good     i would've been pissed if you hadn't    i wouldn't have cared   give me some of that apple     oh  don't      mars investigations   just a sec   it's andy   keith mars   how long ago   what's he driving   i'll get the 7 30 out of san diego

if all goes well  i'll be back tomorrow night        and if not  the night after     i'll call  and i'll check in    you always do     and veronica    yes   when you go after jake kane  you take backup   i always do   by the time dad's plane landed in el paso        i'd already picked up jake kane at his house and followed him to his office   streaming video was invented and perfected here at kane software   the day the company went public  jake kane made a billion dollars   everyone who worked for him        right down to the secretarial pool  became millionaires   he's beloved here   half the people in this town owe their fortunes to him   and i knew the family well   jake's son  duncan  was my first and only love   his daughter  lilly  was my best friend   god  lilly  i see the prozac's working   high on life  veronica mars   i've got a secret  a good one   girls  less talk  more scrub   later   those were the last words lilly and i ever shared   later that night  as i was driving home from picking up dinner with dad        a call came in over the radio   all the dispatcher said was that there was a disturbance at the kane estate   dad gave me specific instructions to stay in the car        but the moment i saw duncan  i knew that this was more than a disturbance   what happened   duncan  what happened   where's lilly   but everyone knows this story  the murder of lilly kane   it was on the cover of people magazine   it made entertainment tonight   the town flooded with journalists   duncan  talk to me  please   and  of course  everyone remembers reading about the bungling local sheriff        the one who went after the wrong man   oh  my god   that bungling sheriff was my dad   but if my dad wasn't right about jake kane then        it looks like mrs  kane is right about him now   not a lot of high powered business meetings taking place        at the camelot at 1 in the morning   they say the divorce rate is twice as high for parents who lose a child    lose a child    now  there's a euphemism for you   that hardly takes into account the way she was found   what  you guys find a way to unlock the porn   it's the lilly kane video   how do you think the family feels   six weeks after lilly's death  someone from the sheriff's department        leaked the crime scene video  within 24 hours  it was all over the net   streaming video made it possible   someone made a fortune while dad took the blame   so does your     does your dad still think that lilly's father did this   that's my girlfriend   your friend   duncan's sister   your dad is destroying the kane family   what's the matter with you people  huh   what's the matter with you   he did it  lianne  the man is a liar   my dad's belief that jake kane was the murderer became a moot point   an emergency recall election removed him from office   mom wanted to move out of neptune   the loss of status  the loss of income was too much for her   we were gonna move  all right  we couldn't afford our house   but dad wasn't gonna be run out of town  neither was i   dad  come here   the neptune sheriff's department     hey  i'm sorry  honey   me and mom are gonna work this out  okay     apprehended abel koontz  a disgruntled former kane software employee   koontz  a software designer  was fired during the development stage        of kane software's streaming video project   shoes and a backpack belonging to the deceased        were discovered on koontz's houseboat by sheriff don lamb  who said     well  this can't be good   car trouble  miss   yeah  as a matter of fact
