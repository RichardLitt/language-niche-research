older ted  kids  i'm gonna tell you an incredible story   the story of how i met your mother     are we being punished for something    no     yeah  is this gonna take a while    yes   twenty five years ago  before i was dad  i had this whole other life   it was way back in 2005   i was 27  just starting to make it as an architect     and living in new york with marshall  my best friend from college   my life was good   and then uncle marshall went and screwed the whole thing up   will you marry me   yes  perfect   and then you're engaged  you pop the champagne  you drink a toast   you have sex on the kitchen floor     don't have sex on our kitchen floor    got it   thanks for helping me plan this out  ted   dude  are you kidding  it's you and lily   i've been there for all the big moments of you and lily   the night you met  your first date  other first things   yeah  sorry  we thought you were asleep   it's physics  marshall   if the bottom bunk moves  the top bunk moves  too   my god  you're getting engaged tonight   yeah  what are you doing tonight   what was i doing  here  uncle marshall     was taking the biggest step of his life  and me   i'm calling up your uncle barney   hey  so you know how i've always had a thing for half asian girls   well  now i've got a new favorite  lebanese girls   lebanese girls are the new half asians   hey  you wanna do something tonight   okay  meet me at the bar in 15 minutes  and suit up     hey    where's your suit   just once  when i say 'suit up ' i wish you'd put on a suit     i did  that one time    it was a blazer   you know  ever since college it's been marshall and lily and me   now it's gonna be marshall and lily and me   they'll get married  start a family   before long  i'm that weird middle aged bachelor     their kids call 'uncle ted '  i see what this is about   have you forgotten what i said to you the night we met   ted  i'm gonna teach you how to live     barney  we met at the urinal    oh  right  hi   lesson one  lose the goatee  it doesn't go with your suit     i'm not wearing a suit    lesson two  get a suit   suits are cool  exhibit a   lesson three   don't even think about getting married till you're 30   thirty  right  you're right   i guess it's just  your best friend gets engaged     you start thinking about that stuff    i thought i was your best friend   ted  say i'm your best friend     you're my best friend  barney    good   then as your best friend  i suggest we play a little game i like to call   'have you met ted '  no  no  no  no  we're not playing 'have you met ted '  hi  have you met ted     hi  i'm ted    yasmin     it's a very pretty name    thanks  it's lebanese   hey     i'm exhausted   it was finger painting day at school and a 5 year old boy     got to second base with me     wow  you're cooking    yes  i am   are you sure that's a good idea after last time   you looked really creepy without eyebrows   i can handle this   i think you'll find i'm full of surprises tonight   so there's more surprises  like what   marshall was in his second year of law school   so he was pretty good at thinking on his feet   boogedy boo  and that's all of them   i'm gonna go cook   i'm so happy for marshall  i really am   i just couldn't imagine settling down right now     so do you think you'll ever get married    well  maybe eventually   some fall day  possibly in central park   simple ceremony  we'll write our own vows   band  no dj   people will dance  i'm not gonna worry about it   damn it  why did marshall have to get engaged   yeah  nothing hotter than a guy planning out his own imaginary wedding  huh     actually  i think it's cute    well  you're clearly drunk   one more for the lady   oh  hey  look what i got   oh  honey  champagne   yeah   no  you are too old to be scared to open a bottle of champagne   i'm not scared     then open it    fine   please  open it   gosh  you are unbelievable  marshall   there are two big questions a man has to ask in life   one you plan out for months  the other just slips out     when you're half drunk at some bar   will you marry me   you wanna go out sometime   of course  you idiot   i'm sorry  carl's my boyfriend   what's up  carl   i promised ted we wouldn't do that   did you know there's a pop tart under your fridge   no  but dibs   where's that champagne   i wanna drink a toast with my fianc e   i don't know why i was so scared of this   it's pretty easy  right     why am i freaking out all of a sudden  this is crazy   i'm not ready to settle down   how does carl land a lebanese girl   the plan's always been     don't even think about it until you're 30   exactly  the guy doesn't even own a suit   plus  marshall's found the love of his life   even if i was ready  which i'm not   but if i was  it's like  'okay  i'm ready  where is she '  and there she was   it was like something from an old movie     where the sailor sees the girl across the crowded dance floor   turns to his buddy and says   'see that girl  i'm gonna marry her someday '  hey  barney  see that girl   oh  yeah  you just know she likes it dirty     go say hi    i can't just go say hi   i need a plan   i'm gonna wait until she goes to the bathroom   then i'll strategically place myself by the jukebox so that     hi  have you met ted   hi   let me guess  ted   i'm sorry  lily   i'm so sorry  take us to the hospital   whoa  whoa  whoa  did you hit her   hit me  please   this guy can barely even spank me in bed for fun   he's all  like  'oh  honey  did that hurt '  and i'm  like  'come on  let me have you  you pansy '    wow  a complete stranger    no  no  no  it's okay  go on   so  these spankings   are you in pajamas or au natural     so what do you do    i'm a reporter for metro news 1     oh    well  kind of a reporter   i do those dumb little fluff pieces at the end of the news   you know  like  'monkey who can play the ukulele '  but i'm hoping to get some bigger stories soon   bigger  like  'gorilla with an upright bass '  sorry  you're really pretty     oh  your friends don't seem too happy    yeah   see  the one in the middle just got dumped by her boyfriend   so tonight  every guy is 'the enemy '  you know  if it'll make your friend feel better     you could throw a drink in my face  i don't mind   she would love that  and it does look fun in the movies   hey  you wanna have dinner with me saturday night   oh  i can't  i'm going to orlando for a week on friday   some guy's attempting to make the world's biggest pancake     guess who's covering it    that's gonna take a week   yeah  he's gonna eat it  too  it's another record   hey  what's taking so long   i know this is a long shot  but how about tomorrow night   yeah  what the hell   jerk   that was fun   de    wait for it    nied   denied   we're going out tomorrow night   i thought we were playing lazer tag tomorrow night   yeah  i was never gonna go play lazer tag   the next night  i took her out to this little bistro in brooklyn   wow     that is one bad ass blue french horn    yeah   sort of looks like a smurf penis   son  a piece of advice   when you go on a first date  you really don't want to say smurf penis   girls don't ordinarily like that   but this was no ordinary girl   lily   how long have you been sitting there   stupid eye patch   mom  dad  i have found the future mrs  ted mosby   marshall  how have i always described my perfect woman   let's see   she likes dogs   i've got five dogs   she drinks scotch   i love a scotch that's old enough to order its own scotch   can quote obscure lines from ghostbusters   'ray  when someone asks you if you're a god  you say  'yes ''  and i'm saving the best for last   do you want these  i hate olives     she hates olives  awesome    the olive theory   the olive theory is based on my friends  marshall and lily   he hates olives  she loves them  and in a weird way   that's what makes them such a great couple   perfect balance   you know  i've had a jar of olives just sitting in my fridge forever   i could take them off your hands   they're all yours   oh  it is on   it is on till the break of dawn   but  wait  it's only the break of 10 30  what happened   i gotta get one of those blue french horns for over my fireplace   it's gotta be blue  it's gotta be french     no green clarinet    nope   come on  no purple tuba   it's a smurf penis or no dice   there you are   we got a jumper  some crazy guy on the manhattan bridge   come on  you're covering it   all right  i'll be right there   i'm sorry   i had a really great time tonight   yeah  well   so  did you kiss her   no  the moment wasn't right   look  this woman could actually be my future wife   i want our first kiss to be amazing   oh  ted  that is so sweet   so  you chickened out like a little bitch   what  i did not chicken out   you know what  i don't need to take first kiss advice     from some pirate who hasn't been single since the first week of college   ted  anyone who's single would tell you the same thing   even the dumbest single person alive   and if you don't believe me  call him   hey  loser  how's not playing lazer tag  because playing lazer tag is awesome   oh  i killed you  connor  don't make me get your mom   hey  listen  i need your opinion on something   okay  meet me at the bar in 15 minutes  and suit up   so  these guys think i chickened out  what do you think   i can't believe you're still not wearing a suit   she didn't even give me the signal   what  is she gonna bat her eyes at you in morse code   'ted   'kiss me '    no  you just kiss her    not if you don't get the signal     did marshall give me the signal    no   i didn't  i swear   but  see  at least tonight  i get to sleep knowing marshall and me   never gonna happen  you should've kissed her   i should've kissed her   well  maybe in a week when she gets back from orlando   a week  that's like a year in hot girl time   she'll forget all about you   mark my words  you will never see that one again   there she is   she's cute  hey  carl  turn it up      persuaded him to reconsider   at which point the man came down off the ledge   giving this bizarre story a happy ending   reporting from metro 1 news     back to you  bill    the guy didn't jump   i'm gonna go kiss her     right now    look  dude  it's midnight   as your future lawyer  i'm gonna advise you that's freaking crazy   i never do anything crazy   i'm always waiting for the moment  planning the moment   well  she's leaving tomorrow and this may be the only moment  i'm gonna get   i gotta do what that guy couldn't  i gotta take the leap   okay  not a perfect metaphor     'cause for me it's fall in love and get married     and for him it's death   actually  that is a perfect metaphor   by the way  did i congratulate you two     i'm doing this    let's go     word up    we're coming with you   barney   all right  but under one condition   look at you  you beautiful bastard  you suited up   this is totally going in my blog   stop the car  pull over right here   i gotta do something   excuse me  pardon me  just a sec     enjoy your coffee    hey   hey   go  go  go   everybody brings flowers   okay  moment of truth     wish me luck    ted's gonna get it on with a tv reporter   'this just in ' okay     kiss her  ted  kiss her good    kiss the crap out of that girl   marshall  remember this night   when you're the best man at our wedding and you give a speech   you're gonna tell this story   why does he get to be the best man   i'm your best friend   as i waiked up to that door  a million thoughts raced through my mind   unfortunately  one particular thought did not   i've got five dogs     not good  not good     no    get back in there   you're wearing a suit   robin  ted   hi   i was just     come on up   marshall  he's in   so  ranjit  you must have done it with a lebanese girl   okay  that's my barney limit   i'm gonna see if that bodega has a bathroom   actually  i'm from bangladesh     the women hot there    here's a picture of my wife    a simple 'no' would have sufficed   she's lovely   so  ted  what brings you back to brooklyn at 1 00 in the morning in a suit   i was just hoping to     get those olives     that you said i could have   would you like those olives with some gin and vermouth   are you trying to get me drunk   for starters     thank you   so  marshall  this olive theory based on you and lily     yeah    you hate olives     lily loves them  you can't stand them    yeah  i hate olives   two weeks ago  spanish bar on 79th street   dish of olives  you had some  what up   you have to swear that this does not leave this cab     i swear    i swear   on our first date  i ordered a greek salad   lily asked if she could have my olives   i said  'sure  i hate olives '  but you like olives   well  i was 18  okay  i was a virgin   been waiting my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives   marshall  i'm gonna give you an early wedding present   don't get married   i think i like your olive theory   i think i like your new french horn   i think i like your nose   i think i'm in love with you   what   what   what   come on  man  you said your stomach's been hurting  right   you know what that is  hunger  you're hungry for experience   hungry for something new  hungry for olives   but you're too scared to do anything about it   yeah  i'm scared  okay   but when i think of spending the rest of my life with lily   committing forever  no other women   doesn't scare me at all   i'm marrying that girl   lily   lily  i like olives   we'll make it work     so  orlando  you gonna hit disney world     you love me    oh  god   i can't believe i said that  why did i say that   who says that     i should just go    hold on   wait a minute   i promised you these     olives    yeah   thanks  i love you   what is wrong with me   why are we still sitting here  let's go  we can still make last call   what do you say  lil  'yo ho ho  and a bottle of rum'     'cause you're a pirate    okay  eye patch gone   and we can't just abandon ted   if it doesn't go well up there  he's gonna need some support   it's been  like  20 minutes  do you think they're doing it   you think they're doing it in front of the dogs   doggie style   i knew this girl in college  she had this golden retriever     okay  we can go to the bar  just stop talking   hit it  ranjit   so  when you tell this story to your friends   could you avoid the word 'psycho'   i'd prefer 'eccentric '  goodnight  psycho   great     how do i get to the f train    oh     two blocks  that way and take a right    thanks   you know what   i'm done being single  i'm not good at it   look  obviously  you can't tell a woman you just met     you love her  but it sucks that you can't   i'll tell you something  though  if a woman   not you  just some hypothetical woman   were to bear with me through all this   i think i'd make a damn good husband because that's the stuff i'd be good at   stuff like making her laugh and being a good father     and waiking her five hypothetical dogs   being a good kisser     everyone thinks they're a good kisser    oh  i've got references   goodnight  ted     and i'm a good handshaker    that's a pretty great handshake   and that was it  i'll probably never see her again     what    that was the signal   that long  lingering handshake  you should've kissed her   there's no such thing as the signal   but  yeah  that was the signal   signal   carl  thank you  there's something i gotta do   by the way  you should've kissed her   carl  you guys weren't there   i am so turned on right now   guys  trust me  i've seen the signal     that was not the signal    yeah  ted  we're not on you anymore     to my fianc e    to the future   to one hell of a night   that was not the signal   i asked her about it years later  and  yeah  that was the signal   i could've kissed her   but that's the funny thing about destiny  it happens whether you plan it or not   i mean  i never thought i'd see that girl again   but it turns out   i was just too close to the puzzle to see the picture that was forming   because that  kids  is the true story     of how i met your aunt robin   aunt robin   i thought this was how you met mom   will you relax  i'm getting to it   like i said  it's a long story
