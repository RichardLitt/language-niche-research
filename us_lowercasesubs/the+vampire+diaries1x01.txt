you left that girl alive tonight   that's very clumsy of you   ah  that can be a problem   for you   why are you here now   i could ask you the same question   however  i'm fairly certain  your answer can be summed up all into  one little word     elena   hey   we're gonna go mainline coffee  wait for news   i gotta take jeremy home   elena  there's no way i'm psychic   i know that   but whatever i saw   or i think i saw   i have this feeling     bonnie  what   that it's just the beginning   she took my breath away   elena   she's a dead ringer for katherine   is it working  stefan   being around her  being in her world   does it make you feel alive   she's not katherine   well  let's hope not   we both know how that ended   tell me something  when's the last time  you had something stronger than a squirrel   i know what you're doing  damon  it's not gonna work   yeah  come on  don't you crave a little   stop it  let's do it  together   i saw a couple girls out there   or just  let's just cut to the chase   let's just go straight for elena   stop it   imagine what her blood tastes like   i can   i said stop   i was impressed   i give it a six   missing style  but i was pleasantly surprised   very good with the whole face    thing  it was good   you know  it's all fun and games  damon  huh   but wherever you go  people die   that's a given  not here   i won't allow it   i take that as an invitation   damon  please   after all these years  can't we just give it a rest   i promised you an eternity of misery   so i'm just keeping my word   just stay away from elena   where's your ring   oh  yeah  sun's coming up in a couple of hours   and  poof  ashes to ashes   relax   it's right here   you should know better than to think you're stronger than me   you lost that fight when you stopped  feeding on people   i wouldn't try it again   i think we woke zach up  hmm   sorry  zach   you ok   i called jenna  she's on her way   those people in uniforms   last time i checked  they're the police   people are going to stop giving you breaks  jer   they just don't care anymore   they don't remember that our parents are dead   because they've got their own lives to deal with   the rest of the world has moved on   you should try  too   i've seen you in the cemetery writing in your diary   is that  is that supposed to be you moving on   mom and dad wouldn't have wanted this   are you sober yet   no    keep drinking  i gotta get you home   i gotta get me home   why didn't he go for me   you know  how come  the guys that i want never want me   i'm not touching that   i'm inappropriate   i always say the wrong thing   and     elena always says the right thing   she doesn't even try   and he just picks her   and she's always the one that everyone picks   for everything   and i try so hard   and     i'm never the one   it's not a competition  caroline   yeah  it is     i was a heartbreaker      i loved you      the same way i do      but i've got so much
