take your brother outside as fast as you can  now dean  go   mary  no   dad's on a hunting trip   and he hasn't been home in a few days   jess excuse us   i swore i was done hunting   for good   i can't do this alone   now you're taking off the middle of the night to spend the week end with them   hey  everything's gonna be ok   i promise   you think mom would have wanted this for us   dean  we were raised like warriors   you have a responsability  to dad and his cruisade   even if you do find the thing that killed her  mom's gone  and she isn't coming back   don't talk about her like that   dad's gone   i've got his journal  he left me a message   it's coordinates he left us  it's weird  man   hey  dean   what i said earlier   i'm sorry   no chick flick moments   yes    no   we got work to do   dude  you're cheating   no  you just suck   hey  hailey  day six  we're still out near black water ridge   we're fine  keeping safe  so don't worry  talk to you tomorrow   hey  where you going  my moment of victory   nature calls   brad   gary  what's going on   i am  um     you always said roses were lame  so  i brought you  uh     jess     oh  god   i should have protected you   i should have told you the truth   you okay   yeah  i'm fine   another nightmare   want to drive for a while   in your whole life  you never once asked me that   just thought you might want to  never mind   look  man   you're worried about me  i get it  and      thank you  but i'm perfectly okay   all right  where are we   we are just outside of grand junction   you know what  maybe we shouldn't have left stanford so soon   sam  we dug around there for a week  we came up with nothing   if you want to find the thing that killed jessica    got to find dad first   dad disappearing  and this thing showing up again after 20 years   it's no coincidence   dad will have answers  he'll know what to do  it's weird  man   these coordinates he left us  this black water ridge     what about it  there's nothing there   it's just woods   why is he sending us to the middle of nowhere   so black water ridge is pretty remote   it's cut off by these canyons here   rough terrain  dense forest   abandoned silver and gold mines all over the place     dude  check out the size of this friggin' bear   and a dozen or more grizzlies in the area   it's no nature hike  that's for sure   you boys aren't planning to go out near black water ridge  by any chance   oh  no  sir  we're environmental study majors from u c  boulder just working on a paper   recycle  man   bull   you're friends with that hailey girl  right   yes   yes  we are   ranger    wilkinson   well  i will tell you exactly what i told her   her brother filled out a backcountry permit saying he wouldn't be back from black water until the 24th   so it's not exactly a missing persons now  is it   tell that girl to quit worrying  i'm sure her brother's just fine   we will   well  that hailey girl's quite a pistol  huh   that is putting it mildly   actually  you know what would help is if i could show her a copy of that backcountry permit   you know  so she could see her brother's return date   yeah  heh heh   what  are you cruising for a hookup or something   what do you mean   the coordinates point to black water ridge  so what are we waiting for   let's just go find dad  why even talk to this girl   i don't know  maybe we should know what we're walking into before we actually walk into it   what   since when are you all  shoot first  ask questions later  anyway   since now   oh  really   you must be hailey collins   i'm dean  this is sam  we're rangers with the park service  ranger wilkinson sent us over   we wanted to ask you some questions about your brother tommy   let me see some i d   there you go   come on in  thanks   that yours   yeah   nice car   so  if tommy's not due back for a while  how do you know something's wrong   he checks in every day by cell  he e mails photos  stupid little videos   but we haven't heard anything in over three days now   well  maybe he can't get cell reception   he's got a satellite phone  too   could it be he's just having fun and forgot to check in  he wouldn't do that   our parents are gone  it's just my two brothers and me   we all keep pretty close tabs on each other   can i see the pictures he sent you  yeah   that's tommy   hey  hailey  day six  we're still out near black water ridge   we're fine  keeping safe  so don't worry  okay  talk to you tomorrow   we'll find your brother  we're heading out to black water ridge first thing   then maybe i'll see you there   look   i can't sit around here anymore   so i hired a guide  i'm heading out in the morning  and i'm gonna find tommy myself   i think i know how you feel   hey  you mind forwarding these to me   sure   so  black water ridge doesn't get a lot of traffic local campers mostly    but  still  this past april  two hikers went missing out there  they were never found   any before that   yeah   in 1982  eight different people all vanished in the same year   authorities said it was a grizzly attack   and  again  in 1959  and again  before that  in 1936   every 23 years  just like clockwork   okay  watch this   here's the clincher   i downloaded that guy tommy's video to the laptop  check this out   do it again   that's three frames  it's a fraction of a second  whatever that thing is  it can move   i told you something weird was going on   yeah  i got one more thing   in '59  one camper survived the supposed grizzly attack  just a kid  barely crawled out of the woods alive   is there a name   look  ranger  i don't know why you're asking me about this   it's public record  i was a kid   my parents got mauled by a    grizzly   that's what attacked them   the other people that went missing that year   those bear attacks  too   what about all the people that went missing this year   same thing   if we knew what we were dealing with  we might be able to stop it   i seriously doubt that   anyways   i don't see the difference it would make   you wouldn't believe me   nobody ever did   mr  shaw  what did you see   nothing   it moved too fast to see   it hid too well   i heard it  though   a roar  like      no man or animal i ever heard   it came at night   got inside your tent   it got inside our cabin   i was sleeping in front of the fireplace when it came in   it didn't smash a window or break the door   it unlocked it   do you know of a bear that could do something like that   i didn't even wake up until i heard my parents screaming   it killed them   dragged them off into the night   why it left me alive   i've been asking myself that ever since   it did leave me this  though   there's something evil in those woods   it was some sort of a demon   spirits and demons don't have to unlock doors  they just go through the walls   so it's probably something else  something corporeal    corporeal    excuse me  professor   shut up  so  what do you think   the claws  the speed that it moves   it could be a skinwalker  maybe a black dog  whatever we're talking about  we're talking about a creature  and it's corporeal   which means we can kill it   we cannot let that hailey girl go out there   oh yeah  what are we gonna tell her she can't go into the woods because of a big  scary monster   yeah   her brother's missing  sam   she's not just gonna sit this out   no  we go with her  we protect her  and we keep our eyes peeled for our fuzzy predator friend  so finding dad's not enough   now we got to babysit  too   what   nothing   i'll tell you again  i don't think ben should come   roy     look  you're paying me good money to keep everybody safe  i think ben's safest at home   you guys got room for two more   you want to come with us   who are these guys   apparently  this is all the park service could muster up   you're rangers   that's right   and you're hiking out in biker boots and jeans   well  sweet heart  i don't do shorts   oh  you think this is funny  it's dangerous backcountry out there  her brother might be hurt   believe me  i know how dangerous it can be   we just want to help them find their brother  that's all   roy  you said you did a little hunting   yeah  more than a little   what kind of furry critters do you hunt   mostly buck  sometimes bear   tell me  uh  bambi or yogi ever hunt you back   what you doing  roy   you should watch where you're stepping    ranger   it's a bear trap   you didn't pack any provisions   you guys are carrying a duffel bag   you're not rangers  so who the hell are you   sam and i are brothers   and we're looking for our father   he might be here  we don't know   i just figured that you and me  we're in the same boat   why didn't you just tell me that from the start  i'm telling you now   besides  it's probably the most honest i've ever been with a woman     ever   so  we okay   yeah  okay   and what do you mean i didn't pack provisions   this is it   black water ridge   what coordinates are we at    you hear that   yeah   not even crickets   i'm gonna go take a look around   you shouldn't go off by yourself   that's sweet  don't worry about me   all right  everybody stays together  let's go   hailey  over here   oh  my god   looks like a grizzly   tommy   tommy   tommy  shh    shh     why   something might still be out there   sam   the bodies were dragged from the campsite   but here  the tracks just vanish   it's weird   i tell you what   it's no skinwalker or black dog   hey  he could still be alive   help   it seemed like it was coming from around here  didn't it   everybody back to camp   our packs   so much for my gps and my satellite phone   what the hell's going on   it's smart   it wants to cut us off so we can't call for help   you mean someone   some nut job out there just stole all our gear   i need to speak with you    in private   okay  let me see dad's journal   all right   check that out   oh  come on   windigos are in the minnesota woods or northern michigan  i've never even heard of one this far west   think about it  dean  the claws  the way it can mimic a human voice   great   well  then this is useless   we got to get these people to safety   all right  listen up  it's time to go   things have gotten more complicated   what   whatever's out there  i think i can handle it   if you shoot this thing  you're just gonna make it mad  we have to leave now   one  you're talking nonsense  two  you're in no position to give anybody orders   relax   we never should have let you come out in the first place  all right   i'm trying to protect you   you protect me   i was hunting these woods when your mommy was still kissing you good night   yeah   it's a damn near perfect hunter   it's smarter than you   and it's gonna hunt you down and eat you alive unless we get your stupid sorry ass out of here   you know you're crazy  right  yeah   you ever hunt  chill out   stop  stop it  everybody just stop   look   tommy might still be alive   and i'm not leaving here without him   it's getting late   this thing is a good hunter in the day   but an unbelievable hunter at night   we'll never beat it   not in the dark   we need to settle inand protect ourselves   how   one more time that's     anasazi symbols   it's for protection  the windigo can't cross over them   nobody likes a skeptic  roy   you want to tell me what's going on in that freaky head of yours   dean    no  you're not fine   you're like a powder keg  man  it's not like you   i'm supposed to be the belligerent one  remember   dad's not here   i mean  that much we know for sure  right  he would have left us a message  a sign  right   yeah  you're probably right   to tell you the truth  i don't think dad's ever been to lost creek   then let's get these people back to town  and let's hit the road     go find dad  i mean  why are we still even here   this is why     this book   this is dad's single most valuable possession  everything he knows about every evil thing is in here   and he's passed it on to us   i think he wants us to pick up where he left off   you know  saving people  hunting things     the family business   that makes no sense   why why doesn't he just call us  why doesn't he tell us what he wants  tell us where he is   i don't know   but the way i see it   dad's given us a job to do  and i intend to do it   dean     no   i gotta find dad   i gotta find jessica's killer   it's the only thing i can think about  okay  all right  sam  we'll find them  i promise   listen to me   you've got to prepare yourself   i mean  this search could take a while   and all that anger   you can't keep it burning over the long haul  it's gonna kill you   you got to have patience  man   how do you do it   how does dad do it   well  for one  them   i mean  i figure our family's so screwed to hell  maybe we can help some others   it makes things a little bit more bearable   and i'll tell you what else helps     killing as many evil sons of bitches as i possibly can   help me   please      help   it's trying to draw us out   just stay cool  stay put   inside the magic circle   help   help me   okay  that's no grizzly   it's okay  we'll be all right  i promise   it's here   i hit it   roy  no   roy   don't move   it's over here  ugh   roy    i don't     i mean  these types of things   they aren't supposed to be real   i wish i could tell you different   how do we know it's not out there watching us   we don't   but we're safe for now   how do you know about this stuff   it kind of runs in the family   hey   so  we've got half a chance in the daylight   and i  for one     want to kill this evil son of a bitch   well  hell  you know i'm in   windigo is a cree indian word  it means   evil that devours    they're hundreds of years old   each one was once a man  sometimes an indian or other times a frontiers manor a miner or hunter   how's a man turn into one of those things  well  it's always the same   during some harsh winter   a guy finds himself starving  cut off from supplies or help  becomes a cannibal to survive  eating other members of his tribe or camp   like the donner party   cultures all over the world believe that eating human flesh gives a person certain abilities    speed  strength  immortality   if you eat enough of it   over years  you become this      less than human thing   you're always hungry   so  if that's true  how can tommy still be alive   you're not gonna like it  tell me   more than anything  a windigo knows how to last long winters without food   it hibernates for years at a time  when it's awake   it keeps its victims alive  it stores them  so it can feed whenever it wants   if your brother's alive  it's keeping him somewhere dark  hidden  and safe  and we got to track it back there   and then how do we stop it   well   guns are useless so are knives   basically     we gotta torch the sucker   dean   what is it   you know   i was thinking that those claw prints  so clear and distinct  they were almost too easy to follow   you okay  his neck's broken   run  run  go  go  go  go  go   come on  i got you  i got you   hailey   dean   if it keeps its victims alive  why would it kill roy   honestly   i think because roy shot at it  he pissed it off   they went this way   it's better than bread crumbs   hey  it's okay  it's okay  it's okay   dean   you  wake up   dean  hey  you okay   yeah   hailey    hailey   wake up  wake up   gotcha   you sure you're all right  yeah  yeah  where is it   it's gone for now   tommy   tommy   cut him down   we're gonna get you home   check it out   flare guns  those will work   looks like someone's home for supper  we'll never out run it   you thinking what i'm thinking  yeah  i think so   all right  listen to me  stay with sam  he's gonna get you out of here   what are you gonna do   it's chow time  you freakin' bastard   yeah  that's right  bring it on  baby  i taste good   all right  come on  hurry   hey   hey  you want some white meat  bitch    i'm right here   get him out of here  sam  no   go  go   go   come on   come on   sam   come on  hurry  hurry  hurry  go   get behind me   not bad  huh   that's when it circled the campsite  i mean  this grizzly must have weighed 800  900 pounds   so  really  i don't know how to thank you   must you cheapen the moment  yeah   you riding with your brother  yeah   let's go   i hope you find your father   thanks  sam   man  i hate camping   me too   sam  you know we're gonna find dad  right   yeah  i know   but in the meantime  i'm driving
