mean nikki   she's 14  kyle    hmm   now  would it be fair to say that this comet is close in size  to haley's comet  or is it a little bigger   well  actually  as far as comets go  this one's a little smaller than haley's   but what makes this particularly interesting to us  is how close it will pass by earth   and what are the predictions on how close it will pass   hey  kiddo  somewhere between two  and five million miles   you're missing the show   there's a big comet      the distance from the sun to the earth is about 93 million miles     nasa says we'll never see one closer in our lifetime   yeah  i didn't think that would work      appears to have little or no tail   well  it's a little unusual     hi   how is he   the same   same as always   some of your mail's still

description living down in monterey   but it wasn't him  was it   shawn can be anywhere   even if you found him it wouldn't wake kyle up   at least i'd have some answers   i'm worried about you  tom

know you can hear me   let me in   you want me to wake the whole neighborhood   tom   what are you doing here   your phone is off   ryland wants us to come in   what's up   there's been a murder   the police are holding one of the 4400   that's him   that's orson bailey   bailey  some kind of businessman  right   right   life insurance  yeah   disappeared in the '70s   '79  declared dead in '86   seatle police are holding him  in connection with a homicide  in madison park last night   do they know he's one of the 4400   bailey told them  thats why they called us   well  i thought the returnees  were told not to discuss their status   well  we counsel them to avoid it  if they possibly can  but  you know   we were talking job interviews  and housing applications   there's not really a protocol  for being questioned about a murder   you said holding  not charging   that's right  there are some conflicting reports  about what actually went on at the crime scene   we'll check it out   quietly  i don't want to be  dodging microphones at the 6 00 news   quietly it is   diana   hi  this is linda   i can't take your call right now   but please leave me a message and i'll call you back   linda  it's me again   you said we needed to talk  so pick up the phone   linda  come on   all right  call me   everything all right   yeah  same old same old   call me  don't call me  i wish she'd make up her mind   you know  i had a boyfriend once   every time he'd tell     a boyfriend   well  don't look so surprised   yeah  anyway  the thing about this guy  that used to drive  you can stop   i barely got started   all i'm saying is   you don't have to try to make me feel better   well  it was more of an attempt at bonding  via a shared similar experience   can you open the door   how long did you go out with this guy   nine months   nine months  mm hmm   so  you're equating your nine months  of dating with my 19 years of marriage   yeah  you're right   okay  forget it   you want me to drive   what for   i don't know  so you can brood   just get in   look who floated in on a ball of light   remember me  farrell   rossi   hi   well  it looks like the steroids finally kicked in   funny man  funny   always did appreciate your sense of humor   like that time you sold me those concert tickets  right before you disappeared   to the foo fighters   how was the show   i wouldn't know  the cops were waiting for me when i showed up   tickets were stolen  man  you got me arrested   you got arrested for stolen tickets   yeah  i had five tabs of x on me   i had to pee into a cup once a week for two years because of you   stop it  hey  hey  come on  get off of him   this is between me and your brother   yeah  well  i'm making it between you a me   see you around  freak   oh  by the way  how'd you like  the new paint job on your ride   you okay   i'm fine   the security cameras caught everything   the guy definitely had a bug up his ass   except  as far as we can tell  he never went inside   kensington fell into all that glass and impaled himself   you've been through all the footage   every scrap  bailey never made it past the gate   wait  hold on a second  did you see that   that's glass   yeah   something blew out the windows  but from the inside   yeah  we're still trying to figure that one out   there was no seismic activity   no evidence of a bomb or a gas leak   and bailey's not talking   we've sent half a dozen guys in there   but he hasn't given us anything   look  i've been over and over this with you people   we're not the police  we're homeland security   well  tell the bozos out there  that i had nothing to do with what happened to adam   let's just go over your day again   you went to see  adam kensington about a job   and even though your name is still  on the company letterhead  he brushed you off   i know how that'd make me feel   i admit it  i was angry   i went to adam's house to  uh     i don't know why i went   but i didn't kill him   let me read you an e mail  kensington sent his attorney  after your visit   it's not important   just a sec    bailey is making desperate claims   regarding his financial stake in the company    he actually threatened to sue    i don't think he realizes   that there are probably going to be   hundreds of lawsuits involving the 4400    it'll take years    the poor bastard  he really is a rather     pathetic case    i am not a lawyer   but i'm not an idiot either   you've had me here for 12 hours   now  either you charge me  with something      or let me go   so  we're just going to let him walk  after what happened in there   yeah  looks like it  but for future reference   if i ever want to play good cop bad cop  i'll let you know   which one do i get to be   this isn't a joke   there's a time to lean on a guy  and that wasn't it   you shut him down   look  i'm sorry   but bailey admitted he was angry with kensington   he was at his house   i didn't say it was over  did i   do you think they ever thought about me   oh  sweetie   they were your parents   i am sure that they thought  about you every day   thanks for bringing me here   oh   this place used to be so nice   now the kids leave their garbage everywhere   ah  it really is a shame   you don't have to worry  crown ridge is nice   crown ridge cemetery   yes   that's where you'll be   be      be what   buried   kensington's a popular guy around here today   the whole staff's been through to look at the postmortem   yeah  why's that   well  he might have been a boring old suit when he was alive   but in death    he's a rock star   god  look at that   those were his parietal bones   we've seen beating deaths in here as bad as you can imagine   even the guy that jumped off the space nedle  and had to be brought to us in a garbage bag   but i have never seen a skull in this kind of shape before   thousands of tiny little bone fragments     kensington was impaled   are you saying that's not how he died   oh  that would have killed him   but he was already dead from a shattered skull   hello   hello  is  uh    lily there   who   is this heidi   yes   i'm richard tyler   a friend of your mother's   my mother's name is carol   are you sure you have the right number   this is the moore residence  isn't it   yeah  buthere's no one  named lily here   sorry   well  i'm afraid i can't give you  any medicine for the nausea   why not   because it wouldn't work   you're not sick  lily   you're pregnant   that's impossible   the the quarantine doctors would have told me   you said they gave you  a full screening seven weeks ago   if you just conceived   it wouldn't have shown up in their tests   conceived       when   i assume it happened right before you disappeared   but there's no mistake   you're definitely pregnant   now  there's nothing to worry about   i would like to see you again next week   and you can get used to the information   shawn   hey   how you doing   mm

don't think so   why not   um  well  they're going to be listening to music  i've never listened to   talking about movies i've never seen   school is bad enough   partying with a bunch of runts from     is that how you saw me  a runt   you were 14  nikki   and now   i'm late for class   where's my wife   my wife  where is she   mr  bailey  you have our deepest condolences   what   we called your hotel room   there was no answer  elizabeth   it was a pulmonary embolism   about 1 00 this morning   we tried to revive her   no   a pulmonary embolism     please  mr  bailey   calm down   don't tell me e's dead   mr  bailey  just calm down   she's all i have   let go of me   no   no   get away from me   so the red dots  mark the spots where the american members  of the 4400 originally lived   you mean the returnees   not according to the press   it's the 4400   you know  you have to admit   it's a bit strange   a nice round number like that   ff i wonder if it has any significance   so you're saying that if 3 781 people  had suddenly showed up that night   it wouldn't have been as strange   i'd say    slightly less strange   this  however  is downright weird   here's where the 4400 are right now   two weeks after their release    they're just not going home   and none of them can come up with a good reason as to why   you think it means something   in the cdc  we'd call this  a statistically significant disease cluster   yeah  well  in the fbi   we'd call it a freaky coincidence   well  i don't believe in coincidences   disease clusters   i believe in those   what do you mean  you're pregnant   i just found o a few days ago   i don't understand   when you were disappeared  i'd been in new york  for weeks studying for the bar   i can't explain it   i haven't been with anyone else   so what are we talking   immaculate conception   i don't know what we're talking about   i wish i did   you know  when you disappeared     i would have given anything in the world  to talk to you again   i had whole conversations  with you in my head   i missed you so much  lily   but we can't do this   i have another family now   and i'm sorry  i know that's not fair you  but     brian  i'm still part of your life   whether you want me to be or not   lily  you haven't been a part of my life for 11 years   i want to see heidi   i'm sorry  that's impossible   she's my daughter   she doesn't know that   she thinks that carol is her mother   you never told her about me   she was a baby when you left   hell  we were babies when you left   you can't stop me from seeing her   i already have   what is that   it's a temporary  restraining order   brian  i haven't done anything wrong   lily  i'm a lawyer   i know how to work the system   now  i don't want to use this   but i will if you force me to   my first priority has to be to protect my family   i am your family   i wish you were   but you're not   not anymore   i'm sorry  lil  i'm asking you   please  stay away from heidi   and from me   i'm sorry  lil   at first i thought it was an earthquake   everything was shaking  falling off the walls   but then  i can't believe i'm going to say this   things started to fly around the room   paper  chairs   what do you mean  fly   i mean fly  like it was a tornado   except there was no wind   everybody was screaming  mr  bailey was shouting   my head felt like it was going to burst   and then suddenly it was over   what about bailey   oh  he looked scared   like the rest of us   that's when he ran away   the staff    everyone's saying  he's one of these people   the 4400   is that true   listen to me very carefully   you are not going to talk about this  to the press or anyone else   and the same goes for your staff   if i pick up a paper and see a word of this  or i see it reported on the news   i'm going to take an interest in this place   things flying around the room   i know  but we got a half dozen witnesses  all saying the same thing   yeah  flying   i've got to do a briefing for home sec dc  in the morning and i'm going to tell them what   well  i'd go with   the incident is under investigation    bailey checked out of his hotel  after he left the nursing home   he could be on the run  we're not sure   find him   you bought us some time   but this story's going to leak  and i want bailey in our hands before it does   so is calculus everything you remember it to be   uh  you heard about  williamson and ms  sinclair  right   no   no   oh  they found them in the janitor's closet   what is that   making out  not dead   what   everybody in school's been talking about it   yo  freak   you still hiding behind your little brother   you know what  brad   you need to shut it down   you want to shut me down   you know  the only

mrs  bailey   it's a box of trinkets   they're not trinkets  they're memories   the kind you leave behind   you know  for your family and friends   i should get to work on that   i'm not going there   well  believe it or not   some of us are happier alone   no one's happier alone   if they think that  they're kidding themselves   i thought you weren't going there   you see this   this looks

north facing exposur  somewhere within the vicinity of appleton lake   if it's still standing   no structures in grids one  two  three and nine   four and seven each have one  but they're the wrong shape   let's eliminate all those   that leaves us with  five  six and eight   that's too small   at's the wrong orientation   that's too small  that's too big   nothing but trees in eight   it's not there anymore   hang on a second   get in a little tighter on this   well    it looks like it could be a house   no  this was taken 50 years ago   these trees would be huge by now   enlarge again

smart little girl   thank you   the thing is   that the griffins didn't really give a reason  why they brought you back   maybe they didn't have a reason   could be   were they mean to you   no   were you mean to them   no   why do you think you're back here   i don't think they like kids much   why do you say that   they brought me back and i'm a kid   you don't really want to tell me the reason  do you   that's okay   maybe you'll change your mind one day   maybe   woman hi  this is linda   i can't take your call right now   but please leave me a message and i'll call you back   what  she's still not answering   nope   can i ask you a question   no   well  i'm going to ask you anyway   so your son  how long has he been in a coma   three years   that's a long time   you have no idea   maybe you and your wife  you can work things out   you know  one day kyle's going to wake up  and i'll have to tell him his whole family's fallen apart   i go to that hospital every day  and i tell myself that makes me a good father   oh  you are a good father   kyle's lucky to have a dad like you   not everyone does   you can trust me  'cause i know   a baby   you sure   i had the doctors do the test three times   'cause the thing is that brian  was out of town when i disappeared  and i haven't been with anyone since i've been back   i don't understand it  how how could you be      i don't know   i'm sorry to be dumping this on you   it doesn't    it's not really fair   it's okay   i want to help   there's some sort of connection between us  isn't there   i feel it   i can feel it  too   that's why i came back   but it's more complicated than that   your grandmother and i   we weren't just friends  it was    it was more than that   we were going to start a family   i think part of me already knew that   the way you talk about her   the look in your eye   here it is  i thought i was playing it so safe   it must have been difficult  the two of you   a white woman and a black man in the '50s   mmm  black  back then  i was negro  colored or worse   we didn'care   we figured after the war   we'd take off to some big city  like chicago or new york or paris   but you never made it home   no   i never did   i'm glad you found me   me  too     bye  bye  baby      don't be long      i worry about you      when you're gone      bye  bye  baby      don't be long      i worry about you       mr  bailey  it's tom baldwin  homeland security   we met at the police station   remember   mr  bailey  we're here  to help but you've got to talk to us   go away   i'm afraid we can't do that   i just want to be left alone   i don't want to hurt anyone   that's good because we don't want anyone else hurt   if you leave  i promise  no one will ever see me again   i'll just stay here    listen to me        away from everyone   we both know that's not going to work  mr  bailey   now please  open the door   we can figure this out together   i'm on your side   no  you're not   no one is   my nephew  he's one of the 4400   just like you   i've seen how hard it is for him   i know it's even harder for you   you don't know anything   my wife  she was  everything to me   believe me  i'm sorry for your loss   i don't want any pity out of you   go away   i just want  to be left alone   we can't do that   i said     get away from me   stay away  please   tom   your nose   hold on     i can't control it   whatever it is you're doing  mr  bailey  stop it   i can't control it   stop it now   you all right   yeah   i'll call for an ambulance   okay   we're going to get you some help  mr  bailey   just don't die on me   well  he's alive   but it doesn't look like he's going to be talking to us anytimsoon   as far as the general public's concerned   we're going to deny it ever happened   yeah  but we know better   the question is  will it happen again   so what do you suggest we do  round them all up and put them back in quarantine   you saw what bailey could do   i mean  you felt it    same as me   who knows what the rest of them are capable of   i sure as hell don't   but then again  it's not my job to find out   it's yours   aren't you glad you wanted back in   i never thanked you for saving my life   i never shot anyone before   but seeing him lying there like that     you going to be okay   yeah  i'll get there   you know  i meant what i said to ryland back there   if orson can do those things   who knows where all this is going   so far we've got one case  and maybe that's all we'll ever have   you ever noticed anything unusual with shawn   because i just need to know  if you had  you'd tell me   there's nothing to tell   wha     yeah  look at this guy   there's like three other sites just like this   but this one's got a lot more stuff than the other ones   what are you guys doing   research   on t 4400    it's just     you know  the web  there's a site for everything    the forty four hundred menace    i know this guy  i was in quarantine with him   they're saying he killed someone just by thinking about it   so that makes me  some kind of freak   no  no  we were just     i want to know how you took brad down so fast   come on  he did someing to him  you saw it   danny  you have no idea what you're talking about   neither do you   shawn   what   you were thinking the same thing   translated by klm07
