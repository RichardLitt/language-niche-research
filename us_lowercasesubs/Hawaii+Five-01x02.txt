the guy that killed your father   he's got crews on it 24 7   they will find hesse's body     yes  governor   kidnapping victim's name is roland lowry   his car was t boned an hour ago   gunshots were exchanged  passengers were killed   this all happened in broad daylight   well  that seems like a pretty messy grab  just to yank an ordinary guy off the streets   this guy's not ordinary   lowry's ex nsa   he used to have top secret security clearance   which means his abduction could be  a serious national security threat   right   what else the governor say   she said   find him    hey  got your message   good  come on  let's start processing   governor's task force  we'll take it from here   chin  kono  stay on the suv  danny and i are on the van   officer lee   north winds must be coming in

it   i'll try   car was a rental   come on  you're gonna make it  to my graduation  right  you know   i don't think that's such a good idea   between our family and hpd     i don't care what they think   you're the reason i became a cop   well  a ceremony doesn't make a cop   doing the job makes a cop   i want you there   no  you don't  they think i'm dirty  kono   they're gonna paint you with the same brush   i'm doing this for you   stay on the car  i'm gonna go pull the footage  from that traffic camera  see if it got anything   ss 190 armor piercing rounds   these guys were definitely well backed   definitely not a local job   what do you got   this van   reported stolen two days ago   two dead guys in the suv   hired muscle from bruddah's private security firm   that's interesting   why's it interesting   this is density layer  ballistic glass   laminated onto a shield of resilient polycarbonate   why can't you just say  bulletproof    i mean  how hard is that  get chin to call  the security company  find out where they were going   guys  roland's last call was  at 6 15 a m   same time he was abducted  who did he call   his son  evan   we got a witness            steve  evan  do you know where your dad was going this morning   no   i mean  he probably told me  but i was only half listening     it was some big meeting   do you know what it was about   look  we don't really talk about his work   did your dad ever have any disagreements with anyone   is there anybody that you can think of  that'd want to hurt your dad   no  i'm telling you  he's the most  boring person you'll ever meet   what about your mom  where's she   she died when i was seven   all right  buddy  look   there was two other men with your dad this morning   they were bodyguards   you have any idea why he would hire bodyguards   seriously   yeah   bodyguards   n no  i have no clue   i can't believe it   that could've been the last time i ever talk to my dad   and i called him a dictator     woman  evan   you all right   i'm so sorry   you okay   god  you must have been so scared   i can't even imagine it   you know  you're gonna come and stay with me  until they find him  yeah   okay   who's that   name's natalie reed  she's roland's girlfriend   she have any guess who'd want to grab her boyfriend   no idea   all right  stay close  if this is a kidnap and ransom   then the abductors might try to make contact   and if they do  i want someone who can run the trace   okay  hey  listen   give us a couple hours  we'll run down some leads   we will relieve you   i promise you  you won't miss  your graduation  it's cool  brah   grabbed the video footage from a traffic cam near  the crime scene  i'll mine it  see if there's anything  on there that can help us identify the shooters   did you get in touch with  the security company that roland hired today   yeah  i spoke to the owner   turns out  roland hired the bodyguards  for an appointment he had  this morning   where were they going   hickam air force base   you know anyone at hickam   a stupid question  of course   man  roland became paranoid   firing off memos in the middle of the night  directly to the joint chiefs of staff   which pissed off his immediate superiors to no end   what were the memos about   he was constantly telling us how vulnerable we were to attack   in fact  he moved to hawaii not to retire   but to carry on with his work   he felt this is where he could do the most good   what does that mean   hawaii's in a strategic position in the global theater   and that the united states pacific command  is directly responsible  for 150 million square miles   literally half the earth   why do you think pearl harbor was a target   is that why he wanted to see you   'cause he felt we were still vulnerable   and he said he was working on something that could prove it   okay  what was it   he didn't feel comfortable  talking about it over the phone   so he was bringing it over today   so roland was about to expose  some serious threat to the island   that's why i took the meeting   that's why he was kidnapped    mcgarrett   steve we've got a wounded runner injured in the gunfight   the tape shows he was hit in the grab  and he went into the kahiko on kalia road       hotel security cameras show  he went up the elevator on the right   he was shot  knew he couldn't  go to the hospital  he's looking  for a place to hide and heal  i got blood   he went up   hey   he's on 36     uh  we're cops  don't worry   you like hippos   i like hippos  too   i got a daughter    she loves hippos  everybody likes hippos   he'll be okay     go  go   you have an amazing way with children   what     here  here   clear   clear   he's on the roof   found him   is he dead   not yet   hey      have a nice nap  princess   who are you     huh   the man asked you a question   where's roland lowry   what do you want with him     hey  you know  i've been shot  too   yeah  you really ought to get that looked at   what's it been  an hour or two since you got hit   what's gonna happen is bacterial infection is gonna set in   and trust me  you do not want that   it goes straight to your bloodstream   sepsis  organ failure  next thing you know   they're yanking out your kidneys   and from what i hear   dialysis is  um  it's not fun   let me ask you a question   your buddies really worth all that trouble   huh  i mean  you guys couldn't have been  that tight  right  they left you behind   danno  move   chin  hold him down  what are you doing     what is the matter with you   give me a piece of paper   run that print   let's go   hey  hey  steve  what do you think you're doing  hey    hey     are you out of your mind     you want to play  huh   let's play  this is not guantanamo   you can't hang a guy off the roof   all i'd have to say is that you came at me with a gun   we struggled and you fell  what do you think of that  huh   hey  listen to me  listen to me   if a suspect dies  he no longer has the ability to speak   ergo  he's useless to us   you think anybody's gonna care   you just killed two people  buddy   i'd be doing the world a favor  that's enough   ladies     you can stop now   i got a fingerprint match  off an interpol database   ergo   you and i are going to have a long talk  later  you understand  get him up     the guy's name is sergei ivanovich   serbian national with a rap sheet  a mile long  he's part of a gang  who pulled mostly bank jobs  jewelry heists   smash and grab type stuff   thieves  thieves take things  not humans   maybe they graduated to kidnapping   or maybe they knew what roland  wanted to show the general   and they want to get their hands on it   either way  take this guy to the office  throw him in a hole   then i want you to run deep background   find out when sergei got to the island  where he's been   all known associates  the whole shot   got it   where you going   we are going to roland's house  okay   these guys are thieves   i want to know what they were after   that way  you're going   shut up   let it go  just let it go   please do not speak to me right now   okay  so we're gonna do that whole thing again  why do we      will you zip it for a second  i'm gonna speak now   it is my turn   sergei ivanovich   he is a suspect   that means we treat him as a source of information  and then we book him  okay  torturing and killing is not part  of the job description  i wasn't going to kill him   why are you talking  i'm just trying to explain     why are your lips moving    go ahead   i know the governor gave you a free pass  okay   but immunity and means does not entitle you  to hang a guy off a roof   all right  i was going to break ivanovich   i just needed a little time to get into his head   that is how police work is done   is that too theoretical for you  huh   can i speak   please  okay   that guy was only going to talk out of fear of death   fear of death   fear of death  what does that mean  fear of death   people will tell you anything under fear of death   that doesn't necessarily make it true   did you see the tattoo on his hand  what   the blue star   did you see the blue star tattoo he had on his hand   that's a new belgrade serbian mafia tattoo   these guys are not smash and grab types   they kill kids   they slaughter families   that boy's going to lose his father   is everything going to become a personal mission for you   you hang a guy off a roof  because you lost your father   danny  you know what      no  no  no  no  no   i swear to god  i just want to know   i want to know  because if everything is going to become  a personal mission to you   okay  i count my odds  at job security  not to mention survival   pretty slim   okay  we are partners   so if you are going to be the shoot first  and ask questions later type of a guy   i would at least like to be consulted  so i know when to duck     okay   okay   just for the record  i wasn't going to kill him   well  that is good   got security cameras  double dead bolts   two separate entrances   where's the automatic gun turrets   evan was right   roland does take  his personal security seriously   yeah  well  it's living proof   just because you're paranoid  doesn't meant they're not out to get you   all right  we're looking for files   notebooks  his computer   oh  thank you  inspector obvious   i'll check the back     fall asleep with your eyes open again   that's funny   this wall seem  weird to you   i'm not an architect  but there should be another room here     wow   wow   this is slightly above my level of expertise   what are you doing   no  no  don't touch it   don't    no  no  no   good  you just put a blip in the matrix   we need to find someone who can make sense of this   you were naval intelligence   none of this looks familiar to you   no  i    look  i've seen super grade level cryptography  before  but this isn't it   this is   this is something else   this is like off the grid hacker world   hacker  i think i know a guy  who can help us   you know a guy   yeah  i know a guy  i know people  too   okay   you got any cash on you   steve  how'd you say you know this guy   his name is adam charles   first case i worked when i got here six months ago   he got busted hacking into atms  all around the island  basically a good kid   he just got caught up with some knuckleheads   and they were using him for his skill set   right  and your heart just bled for him   no  i  uh    just put a good word in with the judge   i mean  this kid had a scholarship to mit   the whole nine   he's really a    a genius    at least 42 minutes of the day   what about the rest of the time   baked like a potato   ah  pakalolo   yeah  he says it helps him  see patterns  and all codes are basically patterns   oh  my   dessert before dinner   hey  jersey   aloha   toast   you're looking all kama'aina   it's the tie  right   really sells it   i don't know what that means   uh  we need a favor  toast   grab your stuff  we're going for a ride     evan  you got to eat something   hey   chin  hey  kono  we found one of the men who grabbed roland   he give you anything   no  but we found out he's part  of a gang of serbian thieves   i'll e mail you a picture   listen  you think you can talk to evan   ask him if he knows this guy  or anything about his dad's business   international contacts  overseas phone calls   anything that might be able to tie roland to the serbs   yeah  sure  i'll try   how's the kid doing   about as well as can be expected  considering   how about you   i'm fine  why   well  you're cutting it kind of close   you might miss your graduation   no worries   you become a cop by doing the work   not walking across a stage  right   good news is  you're off the hook   you don't have to be there   well  good luck with the kid   thanks   any news   nothing concrete   he won't eat  he won't talk   i'm really worried about him   do you have any paper   toast  oh  your kidnapped dude's got a sweet setup   yo  take your time  toast   i mean  it's it's    it's just national security   i'll take my time and do it right   can i smoke in here  guys   no  no   harsh   no way   this is unreal   like unicorn style   i mean  i've heard rumors about this guy online   but i thought it was all just urban legend   he really did it   did what  what did he do   okay  he built a skeleton key   it's basically a worm  that can bypass asymmetric encryption  on high grade security networks   and also allows remote access to infrastructure systems   danny  great   you want to dumb it down for my friend here   just look   wait  wait  wait   that's a rendering of the power grid  of the entire island of oahu   and the radar array for honolulu international airport     what did roland do     i don't know   but you're talking about places with heavy grade  asymmetric encryption   and your boy here hacked them   all with this computer  roland did that   no   i mean  this is all just archives    logs of what he did   skeleton key's definitely not on these drives   my guess is        it was right in there  steve  okay   at least we know what he wanted to show general nathanson    the skeleton key and what it could do   okay  so hold on   if roland can hack  into the island infrastructure   any government network computer     and whoever has him can do the same   what are you making   a crane   in japan  it's a symbol of peace   honor and loyalty   i once had to make  for my cousin's wedding in kyoto   whoa  1
