downloaded from  previously     this is supreme bullshit   you do know that we're not allowed to shoot people on sight anymore   i'm gonna reassign you  eastern district of kentucky     i don't wanna go back there    still got family in kentucky   ex wife here   next time i see you  i'm gonna     fire in the hole   how well did you know boyd crowder   we dug coal together when we were 19   did you know boyd's brother  the girl he married    ava   she ended the union last night with a  30 06   i had a crush on you from the time i was 12 years old   you get out of harlan by tomorrow  or i'm gonna come looking for you   now you're talking   guess i just never thought of myself as an angry man   honestly  you're the angriest man i have ever known     looks like it hurts   why  yes  raylan  thank you for noticing   somebody shot me in the chest the other day   you getting something for the pain   well  i can goose it as needed  but i've been holding off   i was hoping that you'd stop by   i wanted my mind clear and my mouth not all full of rubber when i saw you     let's hear it    what do you think i'm gonna say   i wouldn't know   you know  if ava hadn't come in that room     and distracted me with that rifle       you think i could have got you first    i don't know   well  it don't matter   the real question is  why didn't you kill me   did you miss my heart on purpose   i was aiming to kill  that's the way i was taught   sometimes you don't hit the bull's eye   no  i suppose not   but  you see  i have this     this belief  this conviction  that it wasn't just an accident and that     i was wondering if the fact that we were friends  if     if that played any part   then last night i woke up  and     i knew why you didn't kill me   i was laying here  in pain     in awful pain   but i didn't hit the pump because     i knew it wasn't just pain from a gunshot wound   it was something deeper   it was a pain from my very soul   and i realized that   well  i couldn't any more blame you for my situation here  than a farmer could blame his neighbor for a hailstorm   a hailstorm being an act of god   that's right   me shooting you was an act of god   god was acting through you  raylan     through your gun     to get my attention   to set me on a new course   now  i know not yet what his will for me is  but i have faith   i have faith  that the path will be illuminated before me as i need it to be   for even through this searing pain   i am at peace   for i am born again in the eyes of the lord  raylan   and i wanted to thank you  for playing your part   now  if you will excuse me   i must tend to the needs of the flesh  you understand   raylan   did you come all the way out here just to see me   what do you think   initial here  here  and here   stand up   how come   we're gonna play pin the tail on the donkey   just stand up   come through and stand on the feet   you got your feet on backwards   turn around   just checking you for visible injury   all's i see is the nose   which i got when he hit me with a shotgun barrel    for no good reason    is that how you remember it   you should thank him  that's the only reason you got to spend two days here  instead of going straight to big sandy   hey  careful with the teeth     you got any more marshals in the car    task force is undermanned    just me   want to put him in leg irons   oh

arlo givens   any relation   i suppose there's still some   he's my father   no shit   and here you've become a us marshal   how'd that go down with him   i wouldn't know   now take your handcuffs out and cuff your hands behind your back   so  you cooper or price   i'm one of them   fine   i'll wait and find out tomorrow when your picture's in the paper   my name is michael cooper  glad to meet you   you didn't care so much for price  huh   get on your feet   what was he in for   his real crime   being a lousy drummer   he's not incompetent  he could play a paradiddle   but he's showy  has no sense of time   how can you tell there's a bad drummer at your door     i don't know  how    the knock speeds up   nice  you a musician   no  just someone who likes music   yeah  and shitty jokes  come on  let's go   and what were you in for  mr  cooper   i expect you know that already   for one bank job   the thing is  a fella died as a direct result   foreseeable circumstances   but  honestly   if you hire a moron for a driver  it's foreseeable   you taking my badge and my car to get past any roadblocks  huh   and your hat   good night  deputy   good night  mr  cooper   shit   come in  come in   now  let me get this straight   he took your gun   sorry  two guns   your badge   your car   and your hat     he take anything else    not that i can remember   he didn't rape you  did he   we found your car at the airport   which means that cooper either left town  or he wants us to think that he left town   we found this in the trunk   that look familiar   you didn't find any guns  did you   sorry   the dogs chased price into a culvert  and then rachel talked to him   she and tim can bring you up to speed   all right   just a second  shut that door   i got a call this morning from ausa david vasquez   wants to talk to you about your shooting boyd crowder   what's there to talk about  he pulled first  there was a witness   but  you see    put it like this   if you was in the first grade and you bit somebody every week   they'd start to think of you as a biter   he also wants ava to come up to lexington to talk about it     fine with me    which part   about her talking to vasquez  or about her coming up to lexington     you can't sleep with her    i know   i won't   you starting to regret me coming here   not yet   price says the only reason why he helped cooper escape  is because cooper promised him a lot of money   this could be from his last job  he got away with  180 000   never recovered   tell me about the dead driver   he was a mensa candidate named drew baxter   a few hours after the robbery   cooper and baxter headed out of town  baxter's driving   they get pulled over for a traffic violation   baxter decides to floor it   hilarious hijinks ensue   baxter drives head on into a tree   goes through the windshield  and into  the afterlife   and it all fell under commission  so cooper got charged with his murder   so  why is he breaking out with only three months left on his bit   i mean  does he got a daughter getting married  or a granddaughter graduating school   no kids  and his mother and father passed   he was married when he went inside   younger woman  one time exotic dancer  named shirley kelso   didn't divorce until five years ago   still lives in town  i thought i'd go have a word   i'm gonna take a team and check acquaintances   i'm gonna go with him  nothing against acquaintances   but one time exotic dancer shirley sounds a little more fun   what the hell did you say to him   i'll catch up with you at the car     hello  winona    what did you say to gary   i believe i said    hi  gary      why  what did he say i said    he didn't   he didn't sleep that night  and the next morning   he was still shaking  and every night since then   he checks the windows  and he checks the doors     and then he checks them again    i don't know   winona  does gary spook easy   what are you implying  you wouldn't be startled  if somebody broke into your home in the middle of the night   i'm not implying anything   i heard you got jumped by an old convict   does 55 still seem old to you   are you gonna shoot him if you catch him   all right  look  i won't show up unannounced anymore   you won't show up at all anymore   art tells me you were a sniper with the rangers   yeah  i was   what's the longest you ever had to watch a target     three days    three days   shitty little village outside kandahar   you watch a man that long   you can get to know him better than his wife does   how he reads the paper  picks his nose   what glass he likes for tea  what one for milk     if he jerks off  what he looks at when he     when he does     if he's nice to the dog when no one's around   what's the trick to something like that   keeping your focus   they told us to come up with stories about ourselves and the target   what do you mean   stories    nothing elaborate  imagine taking shirley to the movies   watching  price is right   eating takeout chinese   they eventually stopped that       the business with the stories    why is that   they found some folks get so involved in the tales they're telling themselves   they grow to like the target   and when they got the green light  they couldn't pull   that ever happen to you   is that her   looks like it   us marshals   shirley kelso   you think he's here   you're welcome to look around   who's this   they're with the marshals  i'm guessing they're looking for my ex   my cousin dupree  he's staying with me  till he gets on his feet in construction     y'all want a beer or something    yeah  love one   pabst  schlitz  mickey's       it was a joke  we can't have a beer    i don't want your job  then  do i   either of you seen or heard from douglas cooper   you mean since he broke out or since ever   since last night   no  and i swear to you  you give me a card or a number and he turns up   you'll be the first person i call   marrying him was the biggest mistake of my life   you stayed married to him till five years ago   there were tax advantages   any idea why he'd bust out with just a few months left on his bit   none at all  i mean  you ask me  he's long gone     i mean  there is nothing for him here    when's the last time you saw him   before the divorce  yeah   what do you think   sure made a big deal about running down her ex husband   of course  that might have been for dupree's benefit   you don't think they're cousins   maybe  maybe not  either way  she's banging him   that's got to suck  to break out of prison   expecting a blissful marital reunion   i got to think  no matter how long you've been divorced   seeing your old lady shack up with someone else  is gonna annoy the shit out of you   if cooper does show up   you sure as hell won't call the number on that marshal's card   coop might not be so happy to see us  you know   who gives a shit   he's the only one who knows which house to go into   it doesn't matter  i hope he shows up   i'm glad you feel that way   sit down  take a seat right there   how'd you pick the houses   i saw reports on the tv in prison about somebody  breaking into houses in riverbrook  tearing up the floors   i know you haven't found the money yet  i knew that  the minute i saw this shit hole   how did you pick the houses   you told me you hid the money in a house  under construction in a development   and i just figured out it had to be riverbrook   picked the houses at random   you always said your lucky number was 323   so we went for houses with 323 in the address     y'all sleeping together    we're cousins   from all the lotions  condoms   and devices i saw sitting on your nightstand   it's clear you're sleeping with somebody   it ain't like we're first cousins or anything   there's no need to hide it  he already knows   there was one device   kind of a vibrating thing with ball bearings going all around   making it wobble all over   that's randy rabbit  it's our best seller   if i'd known you wanted that  i'd have got it for you back in the day   i was 22 when you went in   you were the 1st man i ever slept with  i didn't know what i wanted   we can all have a real interesting conversation later  about the merits of various sex toys  but right now   maybe we can focus on how we're gonna get you out from that marshal   and what's all this  we  shit   i'm just here to make sure you hadn't already found the money   but we can help  we got tools     we got pry bar  a sawzall    fine  i'll take 'em   how you gonna get out  you know they got marshals watching   i'll wait till after dark  and i'll sneak out back   you're gonna walk to riverbrook  i got a car     i'll steal one    you just leave us   what's gonna stop us from just calling the marshal   good point  maybe i'll just kill you   i'm not gonna kill you   and you aren't gonna call that marshal  and get sent away for all them burglaries you've done   you know how to bypass burglar alarms   i do   burglar alarms that have come along in the last 15 years   fiber optics  net based   i was an alarm installer before   how do you think we got in and out of all those houses without getting caught   all right     you're in    all right      shirley  too  we're a team    fine   but you share the 10    why don't you run out on the porch  and sit down for a spell and keep an eye on that marshal     cousin dupree   i'll do that   i know you must be angry   but i swear i kept my knees together  for 10 years after you went in   finally i realized i had to live   baby  i understand that   frankly  i'm surprised you hadn't gone after my money before now   we only went after it now 'cause we had to   folks in riverbrook   they've been remodeling instead of selling 'cause of the downturn   and we just didn't want someone to stumble on it     that's all    that was the reason  huh   nothing to do with me getting out in three months   i told dupree about it a couple months ago   and he knows alarms and all  and he just thought we should try it   you know  dupree has ambitions  plans   for what  a chain of dildo stores   not just dildos   i told the manager i was your girlfriend   i'm not being presumptuous and saying that i am   i just wanted to surprise you   and you did   i can't sleep with you  ava   now look who's being presumptuous   i know about the assistant attorney who wants to talk to you   i can't be getting amorous  with a witness in a shooting i was involved in   couldn't we just make out a little   you want me to drive back to harlan   you can stay   i could always sleep on the floor   it's your bed   i'll take the floor   can we just put on a little music and dance   do you know why the pentecostals don't have sex standing up   it could lead to dancing   you can talk about cars having a new car smell   this car has  an  old car somebody died in  smell   you had a car somebody died in   you mean baxter   technically  he died outside the car     when he hit the tree    no  i'm not talking about baxter   i'm talking about the red car   my lord  that '71 valiant     i called it the rocket    the rocket  that's right   he told me he got it cheap 'cause the old guy who owned it died in it  and no one wants to buy a dead man's car   and i kept joking maybe it was haunted   and then we went for a drive in the country    windows down   breathing in the night air     and all of a sudden i hear this moaning sound   you know  like a ghost   and i about shit a brick   and this one can't stop laughing   andhe shows me a tape recorder under the seat  playing him sounding like a ghost  can you believe that   y'all want to keep jawing about the old days   or y'all want stay on the money train   what address are you looking for   i'm not   when i stashed the money  these houses were still being built     they didn't have addresses    then what are you looking for   you were onto something with my lucky number    323   but it's not in the address   are you gonna tell us or not   the first thing they built out here was that school we passed back yonder   that was my starting point   i took the third right and the second left   and the third house on the right      which puts it right     here   no burglar alarm   apparently i didn't need your help after all   about as much as we needed your car stealing skills     i stole one    could have rented one faster   and it wouldn't have smelled like a grave   keep it up and your 10  is gonna be 5    whatever you say  old man   you want to argue  or find some money   come on  martha stewart  just drop that   here we go  right here   maybe you counted wrong   i counted right   maybe you counted wrong  i didn't count wrong    not then  not now   the only possibilities are  some other folks found the money and are long gone  or that school got up and moved somehow     which do you think is more likely    let me get this straight   after all this time  you don't have any idea where that money is   no  i guess i don't   we don't really need you  then  after all  do we   come on  let's go   i'm sorry   you have gone so long  i just couldn't wait   sorry   you look good  coop   come on  we got some shit to do     do you know where the money is    i do now   where are you going   i ain't getting in that shit heap again   we get the money  we'll take ourselves another car   ain't nobody gonna stop us  now  come on   i think i know where cooper's money is   come on  baby  when we get that money   i'm gonna buy you anything you want   shit   got to ask     why the hat   honestly   i tried it on one time  and it fit   shit   you don't do exactly as i say  you get two in the chest and one in the head   you boosted a gremlin   hell  with all the alarms and stuff they got on cars these days   that's all i could get   i tried to get a mustang   so  what happened   they take the money and run   no  there wasn't any   why'd they shoot you   i don't know   i don't care   i thought i broke out 'cause of the money   but then i saw shirley   maybe dupree figured out where the money is   i don't see how   i told him either the money was here and somebody found it and took off  or that school up and moved   i knew where the money was in relation to the school   which one   we passed two driving around   shit    we shouldn't have taken the money     you enjoyed it just as much as i did    shut up   how'd you find it   mr   i'm too cheap to hire a plumber  tried to put in a new dishwasher  and flooded the entire place  and then we had to replace the floor   i'm an idiot  but if it wasn't for me     we never would have found my money    and we wouldn't be sitting here   where was your second guessing when you got your new boobs   you enjoyed them a lot more than i ever did     they're very nice    shut up   now   i want what's left of the money right now   or i start shooting   there is none     i'll start with you    he's telling the truth   after the boat and the car and my boobs and the tvs   it's all gone     he's got them tied to chairs    we take the back   rachel and raylan  you take the front   you got a story for cousin dupree   yeah  but it's pretty simple   if he does anything out of line  i get to shoot him   that's a good story   how much those shoes run you    700    700    for a pair of shoes    they're alligator   got your alligator's attention   we'll get you every last cent we have   just please don't shoot anymore   untie the woman   she might could take us to the bank   no  shit   stop   the banks ain't open this hour   shit   let me think   us marshals   i was wondering if i could come inside   no  you can't come inside   dupree  this isn't your home   mr  lonner     may i come inside    god  yes  come inside     you ain't calling the shots here    just coming inside  to explain things to you     there ain't nothing to explain    10 seconds   can you just keep your gun down for 10 seconds   i can tell you both what's what   you can see my hands      you mind standing where i can see you   now i'm gonna give you a choice   you won't like it  but it's real simple   if you raise your gun again   you're dead   aim at the family  you're dead   if you move too fast from where you're standing   dead   in fact  i'd say dropping your weapons  and putting your hands behind your head is the only viable option  but  that's your choice   we got guns and hostages here   i see that   do you really think you can draw and fire  before one of us pulls the trigger   this ain't about me   this is about deputy tim gutterson   sniper in the afghan war   i don't see him   you got a little sniper in your pocket   he's out back  across the street there   he bullshitting   i see cars and people   i don't see a sniper   he's there  or i wouldn't be here   where's the light switch for this room   now  i know that wasn't on the list  but       where's the goddamn light switch     on the wall  by your friend   shirley  find that switch     on three  flip the switch    don't do it   one     two    three   why'd you turn the light back on   he had no need to shoot my husband   initial here   here  and here   going solo again   another deputy in the car     learned your lesson    until i forget   stand up  walk through   put your feet on the feet   you know the drill   how's the gut   they tell me my plumbing's okay  but  every which way i move hurts   i think we're good   did you find the money   the couple in the house found it   they enjoy it   they bought a lot of stuff   have you seen shirley   i haven't   i know she's still in custody   but she helped you guys nail dupree  right     that ought to count for something    she's still gonna pull some time   maybe we'll get out about the same time   maybe   maybe   man   she looked good    downloaded from
