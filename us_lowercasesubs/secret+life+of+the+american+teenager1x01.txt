 glad you're home   i was worried you'd marched over a cliff or something   your dad went back to the office  he dropped your sister  at a friend's house to do homework  if  that band director wants to do all those fancy precision drills  that go on for hours  he should just move to north korea   seriously  that man is a nut   mom  no  he's not   i dont know  it just seems like a lot of hours  to be spending marching around with a french horn going nowhere   nowhere  we could end up at state championships   state championships   i made pot roast  your favorite   you know  i could call up that kim jong il wannabe and complain if you want   by the time you get home  you barely have time  to eat and do your homework  let alone have any fun   you're only young once   you should be having a little fun     falling in love    vo by         who    who   mark molina   the new counselor   the new single delicious counselor   that's it   you've got something more exciting than mark molina   i

almost killed me   i can't take the stop and go  especially the stop     that's too bad    no kidding   it's not good for a guy  it's unhealthy   dangerous  even   i heard of a guy who had to go to the hospital for that   permanently damaged him  he's  like  sterile or somethin'now   well  i told you  i don't do it on the first date   or the second   we've been out on more than a couple of dates

grace   that's a really nice name  grace   thank you   can we help you with something   i'm sorry  i shouldn't have interrupted  i just   i saw you and thought maybe you were going to the game together   i wanted to invite you both to our church for a post game celebration   with the gym being repaired there's nothing at school   so we thought we'd try to invite everyone to our church   we have a gym in the youth fellowship hall   there won't be a sermon  i promise   just music  dancing  and we always have really good food   and it's free  to everyone   we'd love to   but  we can't   see  my mom's out of town  so we're going over to my house  to drink beer and have sex   she's so funny  isn't she     funny    well  i'm sure she didn't mean that   she was just trying to shock me  and it worked   really  could you come   you and adrian could bring anyone you want  as many people as you want     everyone's welcome    will you be there  grace   hey  joe  aren't you kind of an expert on leonardo da vinci   i'm an expert on a lot of things   i hear the first report up in history is on the     yeah  da vinci's war machines   sorry  but you're too late   i'm already under contract to the football team   so  you can still help me out  buddy   no  i can't  it's exclusive this year   new counselor   yeah  mr  molina   mister  well  what's your first name   my first name   well  you don't think anyone around here is gonna call you mr  molina  do you   yeah  yeah  i do     well  good luck with that    thanks   are  condoms still available through your office   no   yes  they are   i hate that guy   i hate him  look at him  now he's hitting on her   why are you so obsessed with grace bowman   ok  why are you so obsessed with grace bowman   because she's grace bowman  she's a goddess   she's not a goddess  she's a christian   you are not a christian   i would become a christian if i could have grace bowman   if by  have   you mean  have sex with  that would be impossible  she doesn't have sex   she's not gonna have sex until she's married  especially with you   or you  even if you became a christian   why wouldn't she have sex with me even if i became a christian   'cause you're you  and she's grace bowman   she's a goddess   what are my chances with someone who's not gonna wait until they get married   your age are having sex   guys     he's a guy  isn't he    he's not looking for a guy   what do you know about 15 year old     gals   obvious avoidance of the word  girls    that's encouraging   maybe  not    have partners three to five years older   all right  well  i've gotta start somewhere   where do you think i should start   maybe there   she's kinda cute  who is that   her name is amy  she plays french horn  she's in the band   she's smart  she's nice  she might be desperate enough to go out with you   no one's that desperate  you wanna bet     why does it have to be a bet    why not   'cause  one  you always lose  and  two  it objectifies amy   who's a person  not a horse   three  because winning is an obsession with ben  and he will stop at nothing   it's a bet   you have to give us something more than one night at band camp     it was nothing    ok  by  nothing   you mean what   it was    not that great   and by  not that great   you mean      i'm not even sure it was sex  ok  guys   why not   i didn't exactly realize what was happening  until after two seconds  and then it was over   it wasn't fun and definitely not like what you see in the movies   you know  all romantic and stuff   maybe it wasn't sex   maybe you just had  like  a really bad dream   and you just think you had sex   yeah  or maybe it was just a really bad guy  that she had really bad sex with  come on  who was it   he doesn't go to this school  it was just some guy at band camp   i just  i can't believe you didn't tell us   telling you now   yeah  well  whyareyou telling us now   no   amy  you're not   that's the second bell  i have to go     we can't just go to class now    well  i have to   i have to  too  i'm in enough trouble as it is without skipping class   i have to go     hi  i was watching you      hi   i'm happy you're so interested in the youth fellowship programs   but i'm afraid you've made me late for class   so you owe me  i'm expecting to see you and adrian  both there tomorrow night with all of your friends   hi  i'm grace   hi   hi  i was just wondering if you were going to the game   we're having a party at our church after   and i would love if you could come   hey  you   it's    amy  right   i'm just messin'with you  kid   you don't think i could ever forget the night we spent together  at band camp  do ya   get out  i'm gonna puke   come on  let's get out of here   i think i broke the school record for the mile   i ran all the way to the grocery store and back in 15 minutes   and that is counting the weird   awkward stare i got from the old lady that rung all that stuff up   why are you two taking a test   they're for you   i hope you drank enough water  don't use it all on the first one   we wanna make absolutely sure   i think the only way to be absolutely sure is if you go see a doctor   i don't have that kind of doctor  all i have is a pediatrician   do you guys mind   here you go   thank you   welcome     here you go    thanks  hon   what's that ring  i never noticed you had a ring like that   it's a promise ring  my parents gave it to me when i promised  them i wouldn't have sex until i get married   i know what a promise ring is  i    i just didn't know you had one   last night   my parents and i had a long talk about you and me   but i thought your parents were happy we were dating   i thought they trusted me   i'm a christian   i'm just as committed to abstinence as you are   besides  sexual purity in or out of marriage isn't a one time vow  grace   it's a daily recommitment to god and his plan for us   i know that and my parents know that   and they're happy we're dating and i'm happy we're dating  because  you are a christian  and we do share a commitment to our faith   that's why i had no problem making a promise to them   when do you think we'll get married   if we do get married   and someday i do hope to marry you   in case i never said that  i     i do hope to marry you  you know  someday   well  i'm 15  you're 16   i think it's gonna be a while   i've got high school and college and i hope medical school   how long is medical school  exactly   what difference does it make  true love waits   but you don't have to be out of medical school before you get married  right   i mean  you can get married before medical school  before college  even   jack  we've talked about this before  lots of times   i wanna be out of medical school before i get married   my dad waited till he was out of medical school  and my mom waited with him   ok  i know     are you ok    yeah   i'm fine   hypothetically speaking  and  not that i'd even be interested in this   i don't even know if it's a sinafter marriage   but i have heard that some people have found that     excuse me if this sounds vulgar   but we have the relationship where i respect you   you respect me  we can tell each other anything  right   right  so just say what you wanna say   all right   is oral sex allowed before marriage   i mean  if two people are committed to one another  and in love with each other  would that be allowed   i don't know   i'll ask my mother   i'm kidding  kidding   but you deserve that   of course it's sex   and you need to keep your mind away from those kinds of thoughts  jack     i mean  what is wrong with you today    i don't know  just     this ring  it just   i don't know  it made me think about things   and you know when you tell yourself not to think about something   and you just cannot stop thinking about that something   it's called willpower   pray i get some  pray i get lots of it   grace  i love you   and you are the most beautiful girl in the world  and  and i'm not saying i wanna do anything right now   but waiting till you're out of medical school   you are gonna be fine   we're gonna be fine   we're gonna save what's meant for marriage  for marriage   and with the help of our lord and savior jesus christ  we'll make it  jack   through high school and through college and through medical school   i love you   hello   hello  jesus freaks   are you done here  i need a place tosit   sure  please  sit down  we were just leaving   i    think i'm just gonna stay here for a minute   but convince adrian to come to our church party after the game     it's adrian  right    yeah   i overheard a little of that   so  you two  you don't     interesting   i just want in the band  i love music   i've always wanted to play an instrument  those uniforms are insane   those epaulets   who came up with those   you're not trying to get out of gym  are you   gym  i would get of gym if i joined the band   does one have to do with the other   both are considered physical activity   well  i know some students in the band who are  engaging in a lot of physical activity   the drummer   others  not so much   never mind  just sign me up   you know  ben   i think it's very admirable  that you'd like to learn to play a musical instrument   however  i think you're lying about your motive   i think you want in the band for some other reason than your love of music   what  ha  lying   mark  we've gotta talk  you're the counselor   you're new here  and obviously you're new at the job   am i right   according to my records  you're new here  too   you're a freshman  right   good research  you're absolutely correct   just tell me why you want in the band   i've been rejected by the french horn player   a certain amy     something or other   therefore i've decided that i'm in love with her and cannot live without her   ergo  i must take up an instrument and join the band   so what do ya say   not that i don't relish the opportunity  to climb the ropes and jump over the horses in gym  but  love calls  and i must answer   so this whole thing is motivated by rejection   to be perfectly honest  mark  it's  all motivated by the fact that i'm 15   i'm a virgin   and if i ever want to have a sex life  i've gotta start somewhere   and my advisors have advised that i start with this band chick   first year band students    beginners'band     is in a different class   it's not even in the same period as marching band   so if amy  the french horn player  is already in band   a change in your schedule is not gonna help you out   how long would it take to learn to play the cymbal   i don't know  but i think it's calledcymbals  and as easy as it looks   i would think you'd still have to learn to read music  so you'd know when to smack 'em together   fine  i  i'll do it  i'll learn how to read music  how hard can it be   if blind lemon jefferson can do it  i can do it   let's get that meeting scheduled as soon as possible   why do you even have to be in the band   why can't you just call this woman up and ask her out   because  as you mentioned earlier  now i kill two birds with one stone   i get a shot at the chick  plus i get outta pe   hey  but if you can take a compliment  i think you're making progress   i like the suggestion just to call her   now  i'm not a phone guy   but i like that you'd suggest something so practical and personal   you might just do well here   i'll find you after i've set up the meeting   i'll look forward to it     could i have a condom    for what   you're gonna need to know what a condom's for if you're  gonna make it at this job  mark   get outta my office   i'll find the band director   life stinks   well  it's kinda funny considering we're in a bathroom   well  what are we gonna do   we   amy  we're in this with you   we're there for you  and anything you want us to do  we'll do it   yeah  just    what do you want us to do   i don't think there's anything anybody can do  madison   i mean  i'm the one who's pregnant   my god   can't believe i'm old enough to use the word  pregnant   in a sentence  much less actually be pregnant   jeez   ok  look  i'm just gonna say this one more time  and then i'll shut up   i think you should see a doctor   because that's what it says on all three tests   to see a doctor   yeah  well  maybe doctors make them put that on the box  so that they still get paid for an office visit   or maybe they put that on there so you can come in early enough   so that way you have options     options    well  i mean   if you don't really wanna have a baby at 15   you better not be suggesting she get an abortion   i'm not suggesting anything   i just think you should see a doctor   and i would go to a doctor before you go to whoever this guy is   there may be something else wrong with you that's making you test positive  for pregnancy even though you're not pregnant   like the monkey pox or a flesh eating virus   that would be a relief   no  no  no  it would   she's right  i'm calling my doctor   you're calling  don't you think your mother should do that   you don't think i'm telling my mother about this do you   you have to  either you're sick or you're pregnant     she's gonna find out sooner or later    why   because  she'll either die or have a baby   and i hate to point this out  but somebody's gotta get that doctor bill   no  they'll just bill it to the insurance   your parents will see the insurance   wait  what if you tell your parents that  you had to write a paper at school about some woman that you admire   the only person you could think of was your pediatrician   since she hadn't seen you in so long   she went ahead and gave you a checkup while you guys talked   yeah   yeah   it's a good idea   except it's a lie   ok  would you stop freaking her out  ok  she's a woman doctor   she's gonna help her  she'll understand   yeah  maybe   look  i'll go with you  we'll go right after school   sshoot   i have yearbook staff right after school   did i tell you i got on the yearbook staff   no  but congratulations   i can go after ballet   it's ok  i'll go by myself   i should probably go alone   all right   why do these people think there's something wrong with a belly button   it's not like everyone doesn't have one   i mean  i have one  they have one  you have one   personally  i don't see the big deal if it shows   it's not like anyone else is covering their buttons   they're supposed to  it's in the dress code   yes  mother  but no one pays attention to the dress code   not until today  when i get hauled into the principal's office  and asked to put on a sweatshirt   why should i follow the rules if no one else does   i'll tell you why   i don't wanna get another call from  the principal's office and neither does your mother   we don't like being embarrassed  by our 13 year old daughter who insists on dressing like a streetwalker  we take our hard earned money  to buy you decent clothes that meet the dress code requirement   forget the school dress code  we have our own dress code   didn't just break the school's rules you broke our rules  rules of good taste   what are you trying to prove  that you're not 13  you're 13   that you're sexy  you're not sexy   do you know what sexy means   it means you're ready to have sex  and you are not ready to have sex   neither of my daughters are ready to have sex   and you two will not be ready to have sex for a long time   a long  long time   maybe after you've been married a couple years   wanna make sure it's gonna work out first   heh  funny   am i right   he's right   although i doubt you get your father's permission even after you're married   you're right   right about what   showing my bellybutton means i wanna have sex   do you have to be such a geek and ruin everything for me   hey  your sister's not a geek  she's a nice girl  and you know what   boys like nice girls   so why don't you start trying to look a little nicer  and be a little nicer   amy  are you feeling ok   you don't look well   yeah  no  i'm fine  i'm just a little tired   bless this time we have together as a family  and know we are grateful for each other   thank you for your many blessings and let us  always remember to share with others   giving the same love and respect to everyone that we'd give to one another   amen   amen     thanks for dinner  mom    thanks for dinner  mommy     thanks for dinner  baby    you are welcome   how'd it go at school today  grace   youth fellowship party  any takers   no one said they'll definitely come  but i think they will   am i going to the party   your mom and i aren't even invited to the party  tom   so i tell you what we're gonna do   we're gonna go to the game  stop by and rent a video   and then we'll hang out here all night tomorrow   that's right  we'll get some popcorn   maybe even i'll make your favorite brownies  how's that   that's ok   i wanna go to the party   i think you should go  tom   the party's for everyone   you can ride over with jack and me  jack won't mind   he might mind   besides  i don't think we'd displaying the trust we have in you if  we make your older brother your chaperone for the evening   i do make a good chaperone   yes  but she does not need a chaperone   your sister made a promise  and we know she intends to keep it   why does she need a ring   she needs a ring to remind other people that she made that promise   like jack   it's not about jack   no  this is about all boys  including jack   tom  why don't you go to the party for a little while   then your mom and i will pick you up afterwards  what do you say     better than nothin'    yeah  better than nothin'   sooner or later  i think you're gonna tell me why these sexual conquests  make you feel like a man   because i know you know why you do this   and i know you know it's not gonna help   we go down this road every week   and then we hit a brick wall   having sex  with as many women as you can is not gonna make you feel any better   and i think it's making you feel worse   aren't i supposed to tell you how i feel   you been coming here enough years to know i'm not that kind of shrink   come on   tell me how you feel   i feel like my     my frickin'father stole my childhood and  dumped me in another family and said   you take him  i don't want him   he's damaged goods    i like the way you started out   although i'd love to hear a little more anger  in your voice  because you have a right  to be angry   because your father did steal your childhood by sexually abusing you   but he didn't dump you anywhere   gigantic hand of social services  reached down and plucked you out of a deplorable  situation and placed you in a family that doesn't see the damage   they see the potential  and hey love you   and i know you love them   but it's the loving yourself i'm trying to get you to come around to   i thought you were trying to get me to come around to not having sex  with every girl i meet   can you see how these two things are related   can you see how you're constantly fighting to prove  your masculinity all because your father was some sick bastard   can you see how you have it within your power  to not let what he did have anything  to do with who you are at this point in your life   i'm not sure i wanna see it  how do you feel about that   i feel     like you don't wanna see it  because you think if you do   you'll lose your otivation for having sex   without constant indiscriminate sex   you'll be a new person  a better person   a person you might actually like  even love   i got some bad news  i love myself constantly  and indiscriminately  too   and worse news our time is up  and i got a date   no  you were late   you have ten more minutes   hi  ricky   jack   yeah  i know who you are   the guy that's not having sex with his girlfriend   what can i do for you   yeah  that's still sex   i told you not to make a bet with him   you really think it's gonna be so difficult to get amy  to go out with you that you have to join the band   one she probably go out with me anyway   bt this way  i look like i'm the kind of guy who'd probably do anything  for a dame  and two  it gets me out of gym   and three she may think you're stalking her   which may seem romantic to you  terrifying to her   four don't use  dame  outside your close circle of friends  which is us   come on  call her   i'll call her  i don't wanna call too early   i don't wanna look too anxious  dames don't like that   what time's the game start tomorrow night   seven  home field   good  i won't have to leave work early   you don't have to go   of course we're going   we're not gonna miss seeing you march in your first high school halftime   thought you didn't like marching bands  and you hate football     but i love you    i don't have to go  do i   yes   can i talk to the two of you alone   you have to talk to them alone about something   like what  finally decide to wear a bra   ashley  why don't you get that  it's probably for you   must be serious  she's sitting down   why the long face  sweetheart   for you  it's a guy   you have a boyfriend  is that what you're trying to tell us     hello    george  give her some privacy   see  i told ya  boys like nice girls   come on   ben   no  no  i'm sorry   i don't remember   father  forgive us for our many sins   for not being strong when temptation leads us astray   give us the strength to do thy will   especially when it's much easier to give in to the pleasures of the flesh   let us not be distracted by the women who are here  to lead us into situations that would lead us straight into hell  and destroy our souls forever  but to cheer us on to victory   their     short skirts   tight sweaters and  hot bodies   say something about winning and make it snappy   yes  help us focus on our game   though difficult that may be  and lead us into victory   amen     more  more  more  more   you should go  you're great   so are you   sure you don't want anything   no  thank you   thanks for coming out with me tonight   my dad's quite the driver   i've been training him to keep his eyes  off the rear view mirror so we could have a little privacy   this is kinda my first date   yeah  it's kinda my first date  too   i don't like what i'm hearing   what are you hearing   idiots falling in love     ben    yes  ben     one the first date    yes  on the first date   how often does that happen   i think the technical term is    once in a blue moon   you seem a little nervous   am i making you nervous  with all my nervousness  because i'm nervous   no  no  i'm ok  really   i think so  too  you're ok  amy juergens   even more than ok   you're good looking   you gotta be smart to play that french horn     how long you been playing that thing    third grade   why french horn   i don't know  i guess i was too small to carry the tuba   funny  too   what a dame   dame   will you excuse me  just for a sec     how's it going    what are you guys doing here   what do you think we're doing here   we're spying on you     so    so this is a really stupid idea     why    because i'm pregnant   not in the church    gym   ok  so are you gonna go out with him again   until he finds out i'm pregnant  or till my parents find out i'm pregnant   then he'll never wanna take me out again   and i'll never be allowed to date again   ok  so  here's what we were thinking   wait  you and madison were thinking the same thing   yeah  can you believe it  it's because it's the perfect plan   you date ben  you get ben to fall in love with you   then you have sex with ben   then you tell ben you're pregnant  then you marry ben   see  problem solved   it's possible  you said he joined the band to be with you  right   so obviously he already likes you  and i checked him out   he's an only child  and his family has money   so   so  what are your other choices   why are you staring at the drummer   the drummer's in the band   anybody who's in the band can go to    band camp   no   no  amy  not him  please  no   you better watch out   i think the drummer's looking at your french horn player   he's the one who better watch out  i'm taking over his territory   the majorette   the percussion section   i'm taking to the cymbals like a duck to water   you think that's gonna impress amy enough to     enough to    fall in love with me     so it's love you're after    yeah   kinda surprised myself   should i take it to mean you won't be needing a condom   hey  save that talk for your office   it's the first date  be cool   be cool   i am cool   i hate that guy   no  he saw you staring at him  now he's coming over here     good  'cause i'm gonna kill him    madison  don't say anything   don't you say anything  either  don't tell him   just stick to the plan   ben's more likely to marry you than he is   and you do not wanna have bad sex for the rest of your life   hello  ladies   what's with them   so  amy  was that your date i saw you with   you like that guy   he's not your type   head do me a favor  dance with grace's brother so i can dance with her   the only one amy's dancing with is me   i'm surprised you dance   what with your having no sense of rhythm and all   see ya at band practice   i think someone feels threatened   so  you dance     not really    either do i   how hard can it be   how many students do you think
