me take this again   you were the local beat cop in that photo  right   you would've taken a witness statement from that woman  maybe  it was a long time ago     wouldn't there be an evidence file    it was a long  time  ago   this is a funny town you've got here   well i'd say  unique   now  is there a point coming my way   i've been a lot of help to you recently   discreet help   and i was just hoping for a little quid pro quo     ooh  that sounds illicit    i was shooting for  civil    all right  ok  it's gonna take a couple of days   how long are you gonna be in town  that depends on you   then just relax  enjoy yourself  you know what you ought to do is go and visit  the haven moose farm  it's not to be missed     enjoy the vacation    i don't do vacations   then look at it like a  uh  learning opportunity   dad     hey    you're still in haven   oh  apparently  i'm vacationing   actually  i'm looking into the woman in the picture    unsuccessfully   what can we do for you  nathan   there's something strange down at the rust bucket  i'm heading out   hey  can i tag along   i'm not really big on the moose museum  it's actually a farm   farm  gallery  museum    can i come     well     i think it's a good idea   nathan here can use all the help he can get   after you   finally  some peace     whoa    all right  so first question is   why is there a giant metal ball   oh  everyone knows that ball   second question  there's a ball everyone knows about   yeah  it's part of a sculpture that's usually up on green st   it's been there forever   every year  high school seniors try to steal it   fail  pick something else       and they fail because         it's a big bronze ball     someone's gonna pay for this    excuse me  sir   agent   uh  officer parker  haven pd    sort of   uh  did you see anything   yeah  a big metal ball crushed my place   was there anybody pushing it  or a truck that unloaded it     just a ball rolling down the hill    is there any person     in particular that you may have upset recently   ed driscoll was in my face last night   driscoll was here   yeah  he's not a big fan of this place since he gave up drinking     you know him    yeah  i know him  i also know his place is up on green st   where the ball was up until last night     you don't lie  do you    on what   on inviting myself along   it's a huge metal ball  who could resist that   exactly   well  there's nothing complicated about that ball   outer shell of bronze  filled with about 3 tonnes of sand   and how long would you say it's been anchored here   church bought it in '68  installed in '69     too heavy to move after     no rust on these chains      i only put them on last year   the new insurance company made us do it  i told them the ball wasn't going anywhere   bet you wish you hadn't said that   all right  let's go find driscoll   well  he doesn't look like the kind of guy who'd get into fights with bartenders  and then destroy the place   you should wait until he opens his mouth     why  do you know him well    more than i'd like   this child belongs to god now   amen   he will walk in the path of the lord with us   it is up to each and every one of us to keep him on that path     hallelujah    hallelujah   the best chance he has of staying on god's path is to live amongst the godly   and to steer clear of the troubled and ungodly   can i hear an  amen    amen   haven    is a fine place to raise a family   but you and i know     it is chock full of the ungodly     can i hear an  amen     amen     what the hell was that    i have some history with the rev   well  you think you could have told me that before     probably should've    yeah  probably should've   okay  so what do you know about him   he's a pompous  self righteous ass   he's never been violent  as far as i know  just angry   been that way since his wife died   all right  so you think you can keep that to yourself while we go talk to the rev   hello   you left in a hurry   and you must be agent parker  you keeping tabs on me  reverend     you're here about the sculpture    tell us about the rust bucket   it's a cesspool  but someone in the town did us a favour and destroyed it   that  someone  being you   agent parker     has anyone taken the opportunity  to welcome you properly to our town  answer nathan's question   i don't condone violence of any kind   if wanted to destroy that bar   would i use a sculpture from this very church   then why were you yelling at the bartender last night   hm  perfect timing    hanna   special agent parker   this is my daughter  hanna  and her foster son  bobby  hi   bobby  i told you  don't bring that bike in the church   i'm sorry    i forgot   hanna  would you mind telling agent parker     why i was expressing my frustration in the bar last night   well  i  um  i'd rather not   my daughter hid from me the fact that she was working there   and i went there to bring her back to do god's work   where her talents can be a better service   dad  um  everyone's waiting for you at the reception   duty calls   hanna  do you have anything that you may want  to tell us about what happened at the rust bucket  no  sorry  um     i only started working there  and we left hours before it happened     bobby  you heard anything    no  sir     you mind keeping an ear out for us    sure  nathan   agent parker   my daughter hanna makes a dynamite seafood stew   every sunday night  so if you're free   we'd love to be able to welcome you properly to our town   thanks  but i have this whole  gigantic metal ball thing that i have to look into   and i don't think you're telling us everything about why you were at the rust bucket   audrey  you're not from here   so i've given you the benefit of the doubt   but let me make something clear   those are the last questions i'll answer about that place   wow  what a sweetheart     so  what was that between you and his daughter   i asked hanna to the prom without her father's permission   he found out  and said she couldn't go   so the prom is why the rev would barely look at you   and 'cause we ignored him  ran up to the ledge     and watched the meteor shower    and      and    meteor showers are better naked   nathan wuornos   just another teenage boy trying to tear your girl's clothes off   no  the meteor shower was my idea  the rest was hers   ah     polyester is so beneath you   oh  ah   oomph   hello     natha      parker   audrey   what did i do on my vacation   i was cocooned by a blanket  you came and cut me out  no big deal       i still think you should get checked out    know what  i    i'll live  ok   i know you'll think this is ridiculous  but when you think about it   it's gotta be the rev  he collects butterflies   and i saw a butterfly right before i was cocooned   god  i can't believe i'm saying that  me either   look  you can deny strange things are going on around here   but we need to press the rev  and hard   what are you gonna say    you wrapped me up in a cocoon  confess    yeah  you might have a point   we need to talk to hanna without the rev around   i already called the church  she's at the food bank   her favourite days are when her father's somewhere else  they said that   well    i might have added that part   here you go  howard   um  bobby  i'm gonna take a break  ok   you know what  a break sounds great   hanna  can i talk alone with you for a minute     uh  well     bobby  let's take a walk   okay   thanks   it's really great that bobby does volunteer work with you like that   well  to tell you the truth  he won't leave my side   getting him to school in the morning is not for the faint of heart  believe me   so  you're his foster mom  right   uh  well  my dad took him in a year ago     thank you    yeah   um  his family was in a car accident  bobby was the only survivor   so    your dad took him in  but you're his foster mom   dad's good at the big gestures   it's the day to day stuff that bores him   yeah  you know  taking in a child     that's  uh    that's an amazing  beautiful thing   actually  you know what  i didn't think i could do it   what the rev wants  the rev gets   and now i can't imagine life without him   the rev's not easy   he's ok   he's the one that brought me home from the hospital when my parents died   and    i don't think i came out of my room for a week   and he didn't try to make me   and after a while i started coming down for breakfast   and he didn't say a word to me  just brought me to school     he's cool that way    is he always cool that way   between me and you  i promise   he has moods   and when he gets weird  i just go to my room  but     hanna just takes it   she's just more used to it  i guess   your dad has quite a temper  doesn't he   he doesn't like surprises  that's all   he's just    he's protective   is that why he doesn't want you to work   um    you know  i know that it's pathetic that i don't stand up to him   i always promise myself i will  and then i never do   um  if you'll excuse me  i    i have to finish this   agent parker     how dare you    hold on  rev   harass my daughter when she's doing god's work   you hit your daughter  rev   i have nothing to explain to you     nathan    i see it    what are you doing      hey   the last time i saw a butterfly like that  i ended up in a cocoon   have you both lost your minds   ahh   what's happening  my god  what's happening   hey  what are you doing   go go go go     so  you think i'm crazy now    i never said you were crazy   this isn't the first weird thing i've seen in haven  nathan   and i've only been here a week  so can you just tell me what's going on   every town's got a few skeletons in the closet   well  this is a big freaking closet  all right     can we at least agree that whatever's going on here  this is not normal     yeah    and can we also agree  that whoever's behind this  it can't be the rev  unfortunately     which means it's someone else    did i say   unfortunately      you know what's not working for me    the bucket   yep  why isn't it working for you   since the rev's no longer a suspect   the bar's got nothing to do with the hotel or the church   they do have one thing in common     what's that    hanna driscoll   hanna's got nothing to do with this   she worked at the bucket  she was there when i grilled her father     and she has issues with the rev    but why destroy the bucket   okay  let's get the bartender in here and see what we can find out   fine   what was hanna driscoll doing for you   just bookkeeping  deposits  payroll     does she have any reason not to like you     why  what'd she say to you    just answer the question     i was gonna fire her    why     she was dipping in the till    hanna driscoll   i told her i was thinking of letting her go right before this freak ball thing   can you give us a second   if he was firing her  it would give her motive to destroy the place     i don't see hanna stealing    nathan  your prom was last century   she had a strong motive to attack me   i could subpoena her bank records   i'm sorry  but yeah  i think you need to do that   just heard back from the bank   hanna driscoll doesn't have a bank account in haven   damn  i had a good feeling about that one   hanna has 57 000 in an account in bangor   far enough away to keep it secret from the rev     well  he could've lived without      mm hm  could've   i got nothing to say to you  except  get the hell off my porch   now that's just unfriendly  considering we just saved your life   you looking for the lord in the bottom of a bottle   i take 'em where i find 'em     we're here to see hanna    she's not here   where is she     out    where     rev    don't you call me that   reverend driscoll  i think that hanna was the one that attacked you   well  then you're a fool  officer parker  because i wasn't attacked   then what would you call it   did you know that hanna had almost  60 000 in her bank account   she was fired for stealing from the rust bucket  that's why she destroyed it   that's not possible   hey  hanna  are you here   she's not here   she's at the junior high school science club   oh    i pity you  nathan   you walk alone  but you think your shadow is the lord's   but the lord cast you out  and now  you're truly alone   maybe i am alone  maybe i always will be   but i'm not trying to lose myself in the bottom of a bottle   nathan   nathan  let's go   i remember when i was in the science club   feels like 100 years ago  that's 'cause it was    thank you    thanks for helping me out   hey  that's what   that's what friends do   bobby  you look exhausted   you're not getting enough sleep  how late did you stay up working on this   uh  most of the night   need to beat your score   well  you finish setting up  and i am gonna see if i can bribe a judge or two     all right  well  i like the way you think   mary lou     hanna  is there some place we can talk    is my father all right   he said that he was gonna take it easy after that    event   we need to know why you have  57 000 in the bank   hanna     were you stealing from the rust bucket  is that why you destroyed it     is that what otis told you    is it true   otis stopped repaying his bank loan   the bank hired me to audit his books  call them  they'll confirm   otis is the one who's skimming     otis is stealing    i earned that money     how    took me 7 years  and the bank wasn't my only client   and i didn't put the money in haven  because my father know everybody and       he would find out    he would find out what   that i'd leave him  just like my mother did   your mother died     she died 3 days after she ran away with the deacon in the church   not the story my dad tells  is it   if you'll excuse me  i have a few things i have to do before i get back to help bobby   he has a booth on butterflies   butterflies   hey  bobby   you here for practice  uh  no  i just forgot something in my locker   if you change your mind  just come on out anytime   the team misses you   will do  coach   bobby   bobby   crap    this is gonna suck   all right       uh    bench    yeah  yeah   the fire alarm  hopefully that'll get us out of here quickly   yeah   what the hell just happened here     he's a great kid    there's nothing strange  you haven't had any problems   after what bobby went through with his parents  it's amazing there aren't   especially since i know bobby's always felt responsible  he does  why   survivor's guilt  he's the only one who made it out of the car     what happened    driving home from the family cabin  the car lost control   i don't think the kid's had a decent night's sleep since  did you see him leave   miss driscoll took him home after the fire alarm  probably had to wake him up  though       wake him up    i think he was catching a nap right here in the locker room   not the first time  either  since the accident   bobby  hanna  anybody home   what the hell happened here   oh    might have found the bottom of the bottle     let's go see if bobby's in his room   bobby   i don't think they came back here   hey  do you see that     remind you of anything    a certain metal ball   and these  the rev's necklace was pulled like a magnet   ah    my personal favourite  the hotel cocoon experience    nd the water and the wire in the school hallway     these are the things bobby sees before he falls asleep   they must be working their way into his dreams   all right  when you dream  it mixes everything up and combines it with your fears   the attacks came out of that  and he thought we were coming after him   maybe to break up his new family   he's trying to stay awake  he doesn't want to dream     he knows he's hurting people    we need to find him before he falls asleep again   where would bobby and hanna go  rev     why should i tell you    sooner you tell me   the sooner i'm out of your house   miller's crust  his parents had a cabin up there   just passed there  they were killed at twin pines overlook     now get the hell outta here    works for me   that boy     isn't one of god's people  he's one of yours  nathan   that's why i never let you near my daughter   because you woulda killed her  just like your people killed my penny   hm  way i heard it  she was free of you for 3 days before she died     probably the best 3 days     ok  all right     not now  nathan   the troubles are back  like it or not   you find that boy  don't bring him back here   kiddo  why don't you lie down  and i'll make you something to eat  something     incredibly unhealthy     how about just a coffee    no  when did you start drinking coffee     a while ago    you should be sleeping     hanna  can we talk about something    anything   what was that stuff about  the troubles      i don't want to talk about it    all right     are you ok   i'm ok     i know  but it must have been tough     i'm ok   but thanks   bobby  you can't really believe that   i don't want to  but when i wake up   the things that i dreamed happened   sometimes i don't sleep much either  and when i don't   it really messes with how i'm thinking   that's not what's happening to me   no    no  i know it isn't   i'm just saying that problems are so much easier to work on when you're rested   and you are so exhausted   can we just agree to disagree on that one   sure   hi  this is hanna  please leave a message   hanna  this if officer parker  i need you to make sure that bobby doesn't fall asleep   i'll explain when we get there   twin pines overlook's coming up soon   about 10 minutes   don't need to say it   i'm pretty sure that's not gonna help   bobby must be dreaming  we have to wake him up     seriously    what   ugh     whoa  why are you speeding up    i'm not     bobby is   relax  bobby  you're having a nightmare     slow down    i'm not controlling the car   maybe if we're in his dream  he can see us   ok  maybe  why  what are you thinking     hey  kiddo    are you talking to me   no  i'm talking to bobby  honey   bobby  it's mommy   bet you're pumped to get home to your projects  huh   i'm sure it's great  oh  wait  i have to tell your dad something   ok  here  it's coming up  twin pines overlook     no  bobby  bobby  please    no  stop  go back    just wake up   bobby   it can be different this time  you can change things   you can save us this time  bobby  i know you can   i know you can  bobby  i trust you   dad  don't play with the radio   dad  don't play with the radio  nathan   no  dad  don't touch the radio  watch the road  please   ok  bobby  i'm watching the road   ah  aahhh   whoa   whoa     you did it  bobby   you saved us  thank you   there you go  it's ok  bobby  i'm here   bobby  stop dawdling or we won't make the cabin by nightfall   he's a different kind of kid  hanna     just like you were    like i was     appreciate the help  thanks   have you told bobby why the reverend won't let him stay at his house   honestly  i don't know how to tell him  he always tries to please my father   that's why he chose butterflies for his science project   you'll tell him when the time is right   nathan    i'm sorry i let my father come between us   it was a long time ago   yeah  it was   but sometimes i can't help imagine what my life might've been like if i'd ignored him     and let you take me away from here   we're doing fine here without you   anyway  i   yeah  i never knew my parents   um  do you ever think about them   you know  there were graduations  proms   things like that that they didn't show up for   but in a way  you're luckier than me   because i knew my parents   yeah   and because your new family showed up   so  uh  dr  carr gave me these for you     what are these    imipramine  it stops night terrors  it should help       for now    now   the doc says that it tends not to work on adults   oh  well  thank you  audrey   so  did you talk to the reverend   it's like we're living like strangers in the same house     he won't even look at me    i'm sorry   i saw him at the supermarket  and he looked the other way  just kept moving   but  you know  his shopping cart was full of frozen dinners     for 1  and i figure that's bound to get old  right     yeah    thanks   well  we had a flood here about 10 years ago  so things kind of got shifted around   as you can see  there's tape still on there  it's the original     what is this  a joke    definitely not   what about the photographer who took the picture  where's the colorado kid buried   there are still leads that we could track down   it's a very old case  agent parker   she might be my mother     well  then stay here and find her    what   why don't you come work for me  you know  you have a very rare talent   most people just want to see things  the way they want to see 'em  whereas you see things the way they are   that is a skill that i value   hell  it's kind of a skill we desperately need around here  that keeps getting clearer   so  you know  you could actually make kind of a difference here   and  more importantly for you  i could maybe help you  find some of the answers that you're looking for   if you were to stay     i'll think about it    ok   your father just offered me a job     what'd you say    i said that i would     think it over   might be a good idea   really  what makes you say that   february 1983  i was 7   i went sledding on that hill right over there   i crashed into a tree   but i felt fine  so i ran back up the hill  ready to go again   and lisa botkee took one look at me  and threw up   i had blood all over my coat and a bone sticking out of my arm   and i never felt a thing   wasn't the only thing that happened that year   don't remember a lot of it  people whispering  kids pulled out of school      the troubles    couple years later   i got better and i stopped hearing about them   and you're afraid they're coming back   no  they are back   and i'm afraid they won't go away this time   i might need to stick around for a while and see     you sure you want to do that    that crime picture with that woman  that i think might be my mother     that was taken around the time that you say the troubles started   i think it's all connected   i guess we're gonna find out   wanna grab something to eat   how about pancakes   yeah  i could eat some pancakes   sync by mczolly
