bit of an odd bird  that one   i wouldn't guess he had any real friends at all   much less one as lovely as you   nolan knows when people look at him   they see dollar signs   so he's built up a few defense mechanisms   it's hard to know who to trust when it comes to money   couldn't agree more  so who do you trust   with my money   myself since 2008   i've been sitting in cash and short term bonds  wondering when that second shoe's gonna drop   my fund actually made money in 2008   really  well  what do you have  a crystal ball   and a magic hat   bit of free advice   the other shoe's not gonna drop anytime soon   you should consider getting back into the market   never said i wasn't considering   well  then you and i have a lot to discuss   call my office   we'll set a lunch when you're ready   loser pays   always   another shocking turn  in the david clarke treason trial came today  as financial advisor bill harmon took the stand  with searing testimony  against his longtime

find out   about your pretty little neighbor   filthy rich and squeaky clean as far as i can tell   her daddy was a wealthy expat   gave her enough to bounce around the globe   collecting degrees and doing good deeds   no romantic scandals or divorces   nothing stateside   there's a few stones left unturned   i don't expect much   why are you so interested in this girl anyway   because she's interested in my son   need i remind you what happened  with that cocktail waitress  daniel fell for last summer   no  i was the one who cleaned up that mess   i can promise you   emily thorne is no cocktail waitress   i'm not interested in what she's not   i want to know who she is   well  then perhaps you should go straight to the source     ask her yourself   frank  did you know   about conrad and lydia   i'm head of your husband's security   of course i knew   but you kept it a secret from me anyway   it's my job to keep secrets   you of all people should appreciate that   now please come

care of her  man   i'd love to  just need someone  to show me the ropes   wait  wait  wait  you don't know how to sail   i was thinking we might make another arrangement   unbelievable  man   i'm    i'm not gonna teach you how to captain my own boat   oh  well  actually  i'd rather leave  the whole captain thing to you   what i want is     someone to hang out with this summer   like     gilligan and the skipper   except this little buddy  can get you on some killer guest lists   you're serious   why would i want to hang out with you   'cause you don't want to see the  amanda   on the bottom of the ocean   go sit down   hello  anyone in there   just a second   hey  it's charlotte     declan    hey   everybody   i hope it's okay  i brought a few friends   yeah  i just     boat's not big

we're wasting our time   you coming   sorry    my dear amanda    the worst betrayals always come   from the ones we trust the most    if i'm at all culpable for what happened to us   it's because i gave away my trust too easily    it's a good age  not a worry in the world   well  she's growing up without a mom     that's a worry    last i checked   you were working on a plan to change that with victoria   what's going on  bill   i'm in trouble  david   you remember the greenville merger   yeah  you made a killing on that   i had a mole on the board of directors   my god  bill   tell me you're joking   i knew that merger was coming   the s e c  gets ahold of this   you're going to jail  bill   grayson's security seized my database this morning   frank called me   grayson wants to cut a deal   what kind of deal   any kind of deal he wants   grayson's holding all the cards   you and david clarke worked closely together   did you consider yourself friends   i thought we were  yes   and when did that change   when i discovered that he had been using  inside information to make illegal trades   after i turned him in   i found out he'd been laundering money as well   and what was the name of the organization  you believe david clarke was laundering money for   americon initiative   the same americon initiative  that claimed the responsibility  of blowing up flight 197 last summer   yes   hello   is this emily   yes  it is   emily  this is victoria grayson   i took a chance and dialed the number  i had for lydia's old landline   i hope i haven't disturbed you   no  not at all   i wanted to invite you over to the house tomorrow for tea   is that something you think you might be able to do   yes  that sounds lovely   good  i think it's time you and i get to know each other  a little bit better   i'm looking forward to it   till then   if you invest your money with grayson   you're definitely gonna see a return  that's a guarantee   i came up through the ranks there   so i know how they work   grayson's gone soft over the years   i still believe in making big trades when it's warranted   that's right   valerie thomas   emily thorne   nice to meet you   nice to meet you   so bottom line     you're young   you're sitting on a huge pile of lazy assets   now is the time you should be taking  some calculated risks   i'm not afraid of taking risks  mr  harmon   i just need to know that you're not rolling the dice blind   still need proof of that crystal ball  huh   for your eyes only   these are real returns of our top tier investors  of the last five years   now that's double digit gains across the board   this     could be you   that's incredible   can i get a copy   a good magician never reveals his secrets   we provide the highest level of confidentiality to our clients   it's vital to the health of the hedge   a courtesy you can also expect  should you decide to come aboard   well     you've given me a lot to think about   ms  davis   thanks for picking me up  on the street corner like a prostitute   yeah  all right  don't send anyone through  for the next half hour  sharon   well  i'll return calls when i'm back at the office   so you do still return calls   lydia  i understand  you're upset   i'm not upset   i'm ruined   what's this   michael's attorney presented these to the judge   and they triggered the fidelity clause in our prenup   i get nothing   the beach house  my jewelry   the damn dog     everything is gone   i am sorry  lydia   really  i    i am  but     what can i do about it   you can write me a check   a big one   this is emily   emily  it's karen with kellar house real estate   i'm afraid i have some bad news   the beach house sold to someone else   what   who   where the hell you been all day   there's a ton of work to do around here   you really screwed me  you know that   i promised a girl i'd take her sailing   yeah  that's why i asked if i could borrow the boat   okay  well  i'm sorry  i couldn't accommodate your joyride   you'll just have to find another way to impress her   what is your problem   you and dad have been acting like such tools lately   are you really that blind to what's going on   dad's broke   i sold the boat to keep this albatross going   is that true   cancel that transaction   it's too late  pop   the bank already applied the sale to your loan     th    then we'll buy it back    with what   all of our assets are right here in this room   dad  i'm trying to save this place for you   nobody asked you to do that  jack   i'm the captain of this family  not you   jack  i'm sorry   i didn't know   well     now you do   hello  jack   i'm trying to book my next sailing expedition   but you are making it very difficult   i told you  if you got in my way   i would take you down   you stole my house   if i hadn't  victoria would have   she outbid you with a cash offer this morning   how could you have possibly known that   'cause i hacked the realtor's computer   i've been tracking the sale all week   victoria outbid you   so i outbid her   why is it so important  for you to be a part of this   when i met your dad   i'd already been laughed out of every boardroom  in new york   i was an mit misfit  with a vision that nobody got but him   the only reason  nolcorp exists  is because your father gave me cash from his personal account  to develop it   and that's because he believed in me   i want the deed to the house   it's already in your name   consider it a     birthday gift for amanda   tomorrow is the big day  isn't it   daniel mentioned that you were captain  of an equestrian team in barcelona   uh  yes  just for a semester   oh  when was that  exactly    why do you ask   i rode steeplechase when i was in boarding school at montpellier   i'm curious what else we have in common   what are some of your other interests   history for one   i'm practically obsessed with it   funny   at my yacht party  you were more concerned  with current events it seemed   art conservation is another one of my passions   that's why i joined new york's landmark preservation eociety   my father always said that our past defines who we are   i would say our choices are what define us   maybe for the lucky   but sometimes in life  we're not always given a choice   emily   hi   hi  what's going on   well  your mother invited me over for tea   daniel  for god sake  pull yourself together   you're a sweaty brute   my apologies   had i known my mother had summoned you   i'd have looked at least 50  less brutish   no  it's fine   i should get going  really   i have to work out some issues with my realtor   things got a little aggressive     in our bidding war today   oh  i'm sorry to hear that   will you be on the hunt for a fallback rental   or are you headed back to the city   actually  as of this e mail   i've just become the official new owner  of the beach house   that's great news  congratulations   thank you   now how about

tea  mrs  grayson   i can't tell you how much i've enjoyed this   oh  man   i wish i could've seen the look on victoria's face   and don't say it was priceless   because that was bought and paid for  baby   i'll get you your money back   no  no  no  keep it   we'll write it off as an initiation fee into our little club   it's not a club  nolan   and we are not partners  do you understand me   yeah

want to go big on a particular stock   i'll make sure it's worth your while   actually  now that you mention it   what can you tell me about allcom cellular   chinese smart phone manufacturer   not really huge in the global market   but i wouldn't count 'em out down the road   why   i want to get in with them  today   today   any particular reason   little bird may have whispered something   thank you   i'll wire the funds this afternoon   and we can deal with the whole  portfolio transfer next week   sounds good   hey  pop  you doing all right   the bottle was half empty when i started   okay  well  i'll be sure to make note of that in the inventory   a young man shouldn't have to give up on his dreams  because his old man can't run a business   i haven't given up on anything  dad   and neither should you   you know  when your mother left   it all went to hell  didn't it   you must be so ashamed of me   dad  i'm not    ashamed of you   i'm proud of you   you've kept this place

surprise me   does she suspect anything   not a thing   in other financial news   wall street is buzzing with rumors  that allcom cellular is now a front runner  for an exclusive contract with innovative chip maker nolcorp   nolan ross  the notoriously cagey  c e o    and founder has promised     emily  bill harmon   listen  that little bird that whispered allcom     it wouldn't happen to be the gentleman i saw you  hugging outside the cafe this morning   well  i'm not saying that it was and i'm not saying that it wasn't   but what i will say    is that i trust that little bird enough  to double my position   that's all i need to know   we're going all in on allcom     get the big dogs in it    you're sure   yeah  yeah  make the trade   everyone in on allcom  people   buy up everything they're selling   everything  now       a fortune 500 company  with nolan being named one of the richest men in the world   he's known for a brazen attitude  and a take no prisoners leadership style   and nolcorp and ross continue  to push the boundaries of cellular technology   we take you now  live   to nolan ross and that announcement  as promised   listen to this  valerie   greetings  earthlings   nolan ross here with what was supposed to be  a surprise announcement about the future of nolcorp   but someone somewhere has a big mouth   i can now confirm that the allcom rumors  came from a woefully misguided employee   allcom is dead to me  and will not be receiving the contract   what  no   instead  i've decided to offer our humble services     no   to allcom's soon to be chief competitor  unitech   well  there you have it   expect unitech to open huge tomorrow   and for those of you who bet big on allcom cellular   get ready to cover some equally heavy losses   in related tech news  the next generation     everybody  listen up   if you value your jobs  keep your mouths shut   as far as our investors are concerned   it's just another sunshiny day   word of this leaks  we're finished   hello  this is valerie calling from bill harmon's office   i'm afraid i've got some bad news  regarding a major stock loss today  and its immediate effect on your

he only sold it to you  to pay off the lien on my dad's bar   no  i did not know that   so you being around right now  probably isn't the best thing for him   i get that a lot   still closed  nolan   yeah  i know   hey  so     what's say you and i hit up  a little party i caught wind of tonight   i'm sorry  gilligan  w    we're done hanging out   well  what if i said  i'd give you your boat back at the end of the season   what's he talking about   wait  wait  wait   you're    you're saying that if i pretend to be your friend   you'll give me my boat back  free and clear   well  see  it'd be better if you didn't    have to pretend   but  uh  that's the gist   um  plus  all the cool parties   oh  he's in   dec     what  that's a hell of a deal   come on  and if anyone could use a night off

thing   hope you're not planning on becoming a comedian   maybe in my next life   my future is pretty well mapped out this time around   one more year at harvard business   then it's straight to the boardroom   wouldn't be surprised if my dad  already has an office picked out for me   that sounds     i know how it sounds   what about your parents   mom  um     caring  smart   and my dad  just
