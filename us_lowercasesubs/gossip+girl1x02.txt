really stupid   i mean  how could i have actually thought that chuck bass just wanted to talk to me   because you trust people  which is normally a good thing   yeah  except when it involves chuck   yeah  pretty much   so the real question is  uh  how are you   me   why wouldn't i be okay   you know  at the end of the night  with serena and the  the  the     was it really that bad   this is me     so   good night    yeah yeah   um  yeah  good night   go walk her to the door something go   ok  whoa  whoa  stop  stop sir  stop  stop  stop   oh  i think i have brain damage   you know what  dan if

trying to be funny   maybe he's shy   or he hates me   no guy in the history of the world has ever hated you   she probably thinks i hate her now   i've waited my entire adolescent life for a date with this girl   you know  serena van der woodsen     and i decide to close the evening with a wave     it was a nice wave    at the end of a date   come on  there's no such thing   and you only get one shot with a girl like serena   i got mine  and i blew it   which means you have nothing to lose   no  nothing except my last shred of dignity   oh  no i think that's gone   you're right   you know what i'm just   i'm gonna go talk to h   i'm gonna apologize for the wave   i'm gonna tell her how much i like her  and i'm gonna ask for a second shot   no  i'm gonna get a second shot     yeah  you

told youi didn't want to see anyone     hi  jenny    hi   what do you want  i realized that i still haveyour calligraphy pensfrom the party invitations   and thought you mightneed them for something   that is the lamest excusei've ever heard   you wanna know what chuck bassis saying about you   no   is he    saying things is anyone   no not yet  anyway   chuck likes to brag abouthis conquests  not his victims   come on  you can help meget ready for brunch   okay  sure     nice flowers    they're hydrangeas   just coffee i'm not staying long   i'd like to get out of herebefore someone throws me down and tattoos me   this is brooklyn  lil not the warped tour   and don't tell me you hadall your tattoos removed   i mean  even that one  that little heart shaped one between your  uh     uh  don't try to be cute  okay   those days are well behind you   and here i thought i was gettingbetter looking every day   so what's the big emergency   dan went outwith serena last night   and us humphreys sure are proud of him   well  currently he's sitting in the lobby of the hotel where we're living   hi can i help you   two americanos     one with an extra shot   you don't actually thinki'm gonna tell my kid who he can and can't date   i mean  is that reallythe reason you came down here   oh  well  i know what you're implying   admit it you're falling for me again   you're right  you're right   it's the low income tax bracket  the bad v neck t shirts the awful jokes   i don't knowwhy your wife you   well  she's got better taste than you   here you are thanks   i mean  come on   why else have i seen you more in the last 2 days than in the last 15 years   an unfortunate twist of fate   but fate nonetheless unless you  uh     are you seeing someone   no  not really   not serious     or he's married that is your type   that's enough  rufus   what's his name i've read about himin  forbes  or  rolling stone    well  whoever he is  i'm surehe can't keep up with you   well  i'm gonna take thatas a compliment  but i'm serious i'm worried about serena   i don't need some new boyinfluencing her  distracting her from her needs   well  no offense  lil   but i'm guessing a kid like danis exactly what serena needs   so  uh     what do you needto talk to serena about   nothing just in the neighborhood     you    i     am nowhere nearthe neighborhood  but i'm workingon a better excuse   you guys  like     i   i don't know   yeah  well that's serena   with her you'll never know   nathaniel   there you are what are you doing   nothing  waiting for you   him   hey  what are you doing here   why  what is this  uh  your hotel   actually  it is   yeah  so unless you havea reason to be here   i'll have to ask youto wait on the curb with the rest of the trash   trash   look  man i live in brooklyn  all right   not the ozarks   no offense to the ozarks   but don't you think we'retaking this class warfare thing a little too far   i haven't even started  man   okay  man  let's just go   don't tell me you're sticking upfor serena's new bitch   if anyone's got a reasonto kick his ass  it's you   he's not worth it not here   this isn't over   hey  anytime  man that one black eyelooks a little lonely   come on  chill out   blair  it's   it's beautiful   i mean  you look     beautiful   it's average   the color is last season  and besides   stella mccartney has a much better versionat bergdorf's   right i     i've been meaningto go by bergdorf's   wow these dolls are great   oh  my god you have a cabbage patch   my brother used to have oneof these his name was
