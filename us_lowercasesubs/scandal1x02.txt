mother of god   you tell him that he better hope to god  amanda tanner doesn't want to come forward with her story   because she just became my client   tomorrow is expected to be a defining  moment for the grant administration   as tenth circuit chief justice patrick keating  is considered the frontrunner to be named  as the president's first supreme court judicial nominee   keating's nomination would not come without controversy   as the more conservative members of president grant's own party  have voiced concerns over keating's past rulings  on right to privacy statutes   you did a nice job with him  the president   getting him elected  i mean   the american people did that   oh  honey  i followed that election   he was a diamond in the rough before you starting working for him   you

angry lover on my hands   but i do remember what it looks like   you're having an affair with olivia pope   i am not having     having  had  don't clinton me with words   something happened between you and olivia   and something happened between you and amanda tanner   i need to know how much trouble we're in   this is not a discussion we are going to have   olivia is representing her   amanda tanner   she's now olivia pope's client   i'm on your side  you understand   i'm on your side   cy  this is a great day for the american people   don't ruin it   sharon marquette   d c 's one stop shop for high priced hookers   yesterday  one of sharon's newest working girls  ginger bell   seriously  her real name is ginger bell   like her parents didn't want her to go to college   like they planned for their kid to be a hooker   ginger bell got herself arrested in the lobby of the hay adams   this is her booking photo  pretty girl   you ever sleep with ginger bell  stevie   abby    moving on   ginger bell sang like a little bird  a bird who has sex for money   the second they locked her in a cell   i don't blame ginger  really  i don't  it was her first night   the first night's always the hardest for a girl  you know   it's the night she learns whether or not she has what it takes   she has to put on her face and go out into the world  and sit in the bar or the lobby or wherever it is they've decided to meet   and then she has to look him in the eye and know  that they're both in agreement  that her body is worth a certain amount of money   of course  it's a lot of money  but it's still a transaction   and then she has to come back and show me what she made  so i know she can go out again the next night and the night after that   i wiped her home computer  and i just searched the copy i made   and there's nothing there  no names  no dates  no tax returns   david thinks there is a client list  and if there is one  we need it   we may not need to use it  but we need to know who's on it   we can't do anything for sharon until we know the landscape   and the landscape starts with that list   well  there were no records i could see  there was nothing encrypted   does someone like sharon even keep records   and that's mason  and that's aiden  in the frog costume   aren't they adorable   and my daughter says they're testing well above grade level   okay  ma'am  i'm sure your grandkids are great and all  but  um    sorry   no  you're right  i enjoy showing them off   what you really want to see is back here   i have them going all the way back to 1986   girl's first name  a date  an amount  and a number     no johns    ten digits  telephone numbers     you're good    i try   phone numbers are perfect  put them in a public records database   and it's as good as a name  maybe better   type in a number and i get every man who purchased one of sharon's girls   his name  his photo  his address   how much he weighs and if he's an organ donor   i'm being thorough   amanda tanner  i want you to go check on her in the hospital   i can help with the madam case   i know i'm new here  and you maybe don't think i'm ready   but i want to be useful   you are being useful  checking on amanda tanner   i mean  you said yourself she's just a girl telling lies  about the president  and she's not going to anymore   she's not going to talk to anybody  you put a stop to that   so  why is she so important   look  i'm just saying  i'm a lawyer  too   and i can do more than get coffee and babysit amanda tanner   don't ask questions  just go   this is why i don't date   this is why i don't trust politicians   it's a who's who of washington   no wonder the u s  attorney wants to get his hands on this list   damn it   liv    i gotta go   who's patrick keating   well  right now  he's no one   but in about 10 minutes   he's gonna be the president's first supreme court nominee   no  listen  it's gonna take at least a couple of hours  for david to get that arrest warrant  don't give up that list for any reason   okay  i'll be back as soon as i can   morning  morris   sorry  ms  pope  but you aren't cleared   when have i ever not been cleared   never  till today   let me see what i can       i'm supposed to take your hard pass    i'm denied   morris  you know me  i     look  i'm sorry  you could still come in if you had an appointment     but you're      is there a problem   because she makes them go away for a living  she's very good   ms  pope isn't on the list  sir     what'd you do now    don't ask   can you get me in  i need to talk to cyrus   she can come in with me  all right  i'll vouch for her   i'm sorry  but she needs an appointment     else i can't let her in    what's your extension  morris   three eight three eight  why   hang on   okay  answer it   hello   hi  this is billy chambers  the vice president's chief of staff   i need a walk on pass for olivia pope  thank you  morris   thank you  thank you     so  what's up    you're gonna wanna hear this   don't you hate hospitals   yeah  a little     is that your sister    she's a friend     gideon wallace    quinn perkins   she gonna be okay  your friend   yeah  i think so   that's good  really good   she tried to kill herself   i was walking by here earlier  i saw the bandages on her wrists   her name's amanda  right  she ever try anything like this before     gideon    yes   which news outlet do you work for   the d  c  sun  and who do you work for   i don't work for anyone  and i'm not going to talk to you   and amanda can't talk to you  because she's been knocked out  on sedatives for the past day and a half  so she can't really talk to anyone   especially a reporter  so you should probably go   this was our guy  you chose this guy  he was your pick  you loved this guy   the president loves this guy   he's clarence darrow for the 21 st century   when he's not writing opinions for the tenth circuit   he herds cattle on his ranch in wyoming   he's flawless  you know how i know  we vetted him and we found nothing   the man is a saint   which is why the president stood in front of the press  and nominated him to the highest court in the land   which i could have stopped  if you hadn't cut off my access   you know why i cut off your access   he's on the list  cyrus   how did you miss this   i didn't  she's wrong  keating's a boy scout   oh  come on  you and the vp should be thrilled   keating's always been too far left for the republican base   personally  yeah  he wouldn't be my choice   but i'm a team player  liv  and so is the vp   manager asks you to put a guy in  you put him in   you can't put keating in   twenty three years ago patrick keating slept with a high end hooker     more than once    maybe we'll be fine   maybe we'll be fine  confirmation hearings are in two weeks   four  tops  maybe this won't come out   it's a dirty little secret  and dirty little secrets always come out   don't they  cyrus   billy  give us a minute   no  no  no  no need  i'm going   but you need to get yourself a backup nominee   since when are you two on opposite sides     liv's one of us    fix the keating thing  now   ms  pope  the president would like a moment with you   please tell the president i'm busy   i don't understand half of this  is this some kind of code   what does  hardwood floors  mean  stephen   why would you think that i would know   because you frequent whores   i do not frequent     fine  you wanna know what it means  it means there's no carpeting   oh   to match the drapes   oh   and what about a  sunny day    on a sunny day  you don't have to wear a raincoat   ah     and all of the languages these girls speak  those are all things   yes  those are all things   so all of these girls are not actually fluent in greek   where are we   almost done with the list of names   any word from the u s  attorney   nothing  maybe he couldn't get a warrant   police  open up   he got a warrant   where's my madam   come on  david   you're after sharon marquette for the publicity   and for getting your name in the paper   and for upping your shot at attorney general  the next time there's a democrat in office   i'm after sharon marquette because she is a criminal   are you seriously the patron saint of streetwalkers now   bring her out or i'll go in to get her   do not touch her   harrison   go downstairs and make sure we don't have any press  waiting to give david a photo op   on it   the madam  olivia  now   abby  get sharon and stephen   what  did you get a name   gideon  his name was gideon wallace  and he writes for the sun   hold on  don't say anything to anyone   i want a private holding cell  no gen pop   and recently cleaned  handcuffs   because the nice grandma is so dangerous   quinn  you do not leave her side  you do not eat  you do not sleep   she doesn't leave your sight  do you understand   yes  yes  i understand   she doesn't leave my sight  she doesn't leave my sight   she doesn't leave my sight  she doesn't leave my     sight   we'll get you out in no time   thank you  dear   no press  but patrick keating and his wife are in the lobby  with billy chambers  they're on their way up   olivia   i'm thinking   harrison  put patrick keating in an office far away from the board   stephen  get sharon out of jail   huck  find out who the hell gideon wallace is   abby  you're with me  all cylinders  people  let's go   no  no  absolutely no   i gave cyrus the heads up because i was doing you a favor   but i don't work at the white house anymore  and keating is not my client   you have a problem  you fix it yourself   liv  it's me  help me out here  this is an fof favor  by the way   don't you friend of fitz favor me   i am telling you  keating is the real deal  and you're just gonna let him go down   come on  you're the big guns  fix it   how about a friend of billy favor   uh  billy here tells me  uh  there's some problem with my nomination   and you're the only one who's qualified to tell me about it   mrs  keating  perhaps you'd like to come with me  get a cup of coffee   she's my wife  anything you have to say to me   you can say to her  i don't have secrets   your honor  your name was discovered on a list of our client's customers  dating back to the early 1990s   according to her records  you visited a prostitute named stacey  a number of times in late 1991 and early 1992   is this because i'm not one of your hyper religious whack jobs   who want to overlook the constitution  in favor of whatever version  of the bible's selling the most brimstone this week   patrick  don't get worked up   sir  i know this is a stressful process   but we are all united in trying to get you confirmed  sir   the entire administration  you have my word on that   if my name's on a list somewhere  i want to see it   my client's privacy is non negotiable  i assure you  the list is real  judge   and your name is on it   this is a bald faced lie  that's what it is   do you know what i've done to get here  what i've had to give up   my entire career  my entire life  has been about sitting on that bench   about the law  about following the law  i would never     judge  that may be true  but we need to go into crisis mode now   my advice to you is that you pull your name from consideration   blame it on a medical ailment or a personal family matter   state how grateful you are to have been chosen   but that you have to withdraw   perhaps we could sit you down with diane sawyer     no  i did not do this  and i will not lie   and i will not withdraw my name  the president called me to serve  and i will not turn my back on my duty to my country   he didn't do this  i know he didn't   losing the nomination  it'll kill him  please don't let that happen   what does your gut say   that he's not a hooker guy or a liar   if he says he's never heard of stacey  i believe him   that calls the whole list into question   makes sense  sharon's a smart lady  she's been doing this a long time   at the end of the day  that list is all she's got   you think she got a little creative with the data entry   would you blame her  i wouldn't   but i'm not willing to throw away a man's entire career  over a little embellishment  track down stacey   find out if keating was really one of her johns   well  it's not the nicest place i've ever spent the afternoon   but it's an occupational hazard  i guess   well  i can get you out of here   and i can make sure you never have to come back here again   but you need to let me give them your client list   no   the u s  attorney is gonna get his hands on it eventually     and it is the only leverage you have    well  maybe   but i didn't stay out of trouble for  nobody knows that better than you   your clients are all grown men  i'm a grown man   i made a choice to do something illegal   and sometimes we have to live with the choices we make   i was the only single mother in my daughter's preschool class   and when she was 17 and found out what i did   what i really did for a living   she didn't talk to me for 10 years   six months ago she calls me up  and tells me i can finally meet my grandchildren   so i know a lot about living with my choices  stevie  believe me   do you want your grandchildren to meet you in jail   no   but the thing is most of the men on that list   they have grandchildren  too   you blocked liv from the white house   i did  for your own protection   i have the secret service  the national guard  and some very scary marine sentries to protect me   i think liv can walk through the white house without posing a danger   i don't think olivia is the danger   i think the person you need protection from is you   this went up on the d  c  sun's blog  today   i need to know what's going on here  the details  all the details   we're not going down because you failed to keep your fly zipped   you work for me  not the other way around   you work for the people  mr  president  i am the people  you work for me   it's two sentences about a disturbed girl   watergate was two sentences about a burglary   hi  cy   mellie   honey  are you ready for the chancellor and his wife   because i think they are ready for us     can't keep the chancellor waiting    you can't   you look fantastic   oh  why  thank you  kind sir   mrs  hanley  where are my remarks   i'm supposed to say something in german   billy chambers told me we've had a snag on the keating nomination   is it serious   we don't know yet  could be   well  you know what i always say  if it's serious  get olivia on it   you sure we're looking for a stacey   'cause i don't think my favorite girl down at camelot's  given name is sinnamon  if you get my drift   sharon had some check stubs   not everyone who worked for her was using a pseudonym   maybe someone kept in touch with stacey  knows her real name   you look like you're gonna throw up  don't throw up in my office   i was doing a thing for olivia and i screwed it up   you screw up  you fix it  you're a fixer  that's the job   i lost a person  i need you to help me track them  or hunt them   or whatever it is you do to find out where someone is   like  right now  at this instant   you try their house  try their house   what are you doing here   it wasn't my fault  i went out to call you   and when i came back  she disappeared   but it's okay  because i'm going to her house right now   and i'm not letting her out of my sight once i get there   once we get there  so i can fix this   sharon won't give up the list   good   we have a client in jail   she won't do the one thing that could get her out of jail   how is that possibly good   if that list gets out  keating's ruined   keating's not our client  neither is the white house  by the way   it's not your responsibility if they look bad  anymore  liv   i don't want to see a man's reputation destroyed  over something that is not true   neither do i  but we've already picked sides in this   and our side is sitting in a d c  jail   good  i won't have to walk far  olivia pope  you've been served   that's a subpoena for sharon marquette's client list   you have two hours to produce it  so  i'll see you in court  going down     it's your turn    please no   i did the last one   who would have thought  ex hookers don't like talking about hooking   you'd never pay for sex  would you   have you   look  everyone pays for sex   at least until they're in a relationship  that's how it works   i buy you dinner  i buy you drinks     it's not out of the goodness of my heart    why do men do it   honestly  to never have to have a conversation  like the one we're having right now   it's your turn   hey  i said share  you have had enough  mister   inez parks  did you ever work for sharon marquette   back in 1991  we're not looking for you   we're looking for a woman named stacey   you both worked for sharon at the same time   take your brothers  go and play with jane and andy  okay   go ahead  mommy will be there in just a minute   what do you want to know   i'll do the talking  you just stand there  don't do anything   look  i could do my job really well if you just tell me what's going on   do you know what you did to me the other day  do you   you made me want to die   literally  actually die  i sliced myself open   and now you're standing here  on my doorstep   which i can only assume is because you know i was telling the truth  about the president   that's why you're here  it's the only reason why you could be     amanda      say it     you don't      say it   you were telling the truth about the president   thank you   now get the hell away from me  and leave me alone   you want to be left alone   a blogger posted a story about you today   just a couple sentences  nothing major   but someone out there is going to follow up   and want you to answer some questions   do you know what you're going to say  exactly what you're going to say   to every question  every time someone calls   because if you don't   there's gonna be more questions from more reporters   you're going to say or do the wrong thing   you'll get flustered  you'll get upset  and you'll say something that'll bring out the dogs   and what started out as two sentences on a blog nobody reads  is going to turn into a full blown tabloid scandal   and the tabloids are going to feel like a walk in the park  once the networks pick up the story   and they will  because this story has a scent   it smells like papers sold  it smells like ratings   your face is going to be on the front page of every newspaper  in the entire world   and there'll be no leaving you alone then   you will never  ever be alone again   i made you want to die  and i'm sorry about that   i'm not proud of that  i'm not   but now i would like to help you   i can help you  if you let me   just leave me alone   write your cell phone number on here and slide it under her door   in a few hours  she's going to call you  and you're going to have to convince her to let us represent her   but how do you know she's gonna call   because i am very good at my job     you find our stacey    nope   but i found somebody that knew her   said back in '91  she planned on moving out west with her boyfriend   montana  wyoming  one of the fly overs   i'm off to court  um     you think zuckerman will buy this is a fishing expedition   as a basis for quashing the subpoena   she might  zuckerman's old school  it's the best we've got   we need to keep that list from going public   take harrison  he's charming     hmm      hmm     i know i shouldn't care   you should not care   you're fine with the fact that he sleeps with prostitutes   everybody has secrets  abby  most of them aren't pretty   in our line of work  i don't judge  neither should you   but why does a man like that  an attractive man   a man with nice clothes and a good job and wavy hair  and a fianc e who loves him  why does a man like that     his name is stephen   why does stephen buy sex from whores   i know  i shouldn't care  why do i care  i'm not his wife   no  you're     liv   one dozen red velvet cupcakes  extra frosting  like you like them   of course you know cupcakes will never work  ms  pope   i have a gun  i could shoot you  but i did get a call from mrs  hanley   the president's secretary   apparently  the president wants you back on the list   thank you   of course  i don't know what kind of cupcakes you gave him   stacey   you didn't even flinch when you found out  your husband had slept with a prostitute because it was you   you put patrick through law school and you moved to wyoming  and his dream became your dream and you dedicated your life to making it real   you're stacey  you're the reason he's on the list   it was my first night  and i was so  so scared   i was sitting at the bar  waiting for my date   and he was late and i was afraid that he wasn't coming   all the girls had told me that there were no excuses with sharon marquette   that you came back your first night out with your money   or you were done  and she was the best   her girls were classy  call girls  you know   not whores   so i sat at the bar  and i waited and i waited   and then patrick came up to me   he could see that i'd been stood up  and that i was pretty upset about it   and so he sat down and he made me laugh   i'd never hit it off with somebody like that  right off the bat before   he didn't know   and i wasn't going to tell him  i liked him   so i started seeing him   i told sharon that he was a client  but i paid for all of our dates myself   you know  we didn't even have sex until our wedding night   and you never told him the truth   patrick would never understand  i mean  we needed the money   and he spent every night at the law school library studying   so i told him that i got a second job  working the night shift   that's what i told myself i was doing  i was working the night shift   it's how we paid for georgetown  it's how he got where he is today   i love that man   i can't tell him that     that his whole life was built on a lie    oh  god   you have a good life with a man who makes you happy  and no one lie can negate all that  but you have to tell him   because if he finds out from someone who isn't you   it's going to break his heart   this subpoena is a fishing expedition  your honor  plain and simple   it's an attempt to drag the hundreds of legal escort clients  sharon marquette has serviced into the mud   name one single prostitution case where claiming  fishing expedition   has actually worked  just one  i'll wait   williams v  pennsylvania  2007   or maybe davis v  florida is more your style   that was back in 1998  i can keep going  your honor   counsel  approach the bench  please   are you aware you are all grown men  and that as such   it should be at least somewhat beneath you to waste my time  on what seems to be no more than a pissing match   we are  your honor   well  thank god for the little things   mr  finch and mr  wright  hand over that client list by noon tomorrow   and mr  rosen  that woman's bail is coming down  to something that wouldn't make donald trump feel extravagant   and let's all get back to making the world a better place   thank you  gentlemen   what do we do now   we get sharon the best defense attorney we can find   i didn't say that   you did  just now  you did  when were you going to tell me   he's a perfect jurist   methodical  analytical  non partisan  he lives by the letter of the law   you chose well   but then  you always do   he would have been a great supreme court justice   i couldn't stop it  it's coming out   i'll have to find another nominee  any suggestions   i don't work for you anymore   you think they'll get past this   i don't know how they can   i think  that those two people want to be together   i think that love  at the end of the day   is stronger than some mistake somebody made   something they did that they regret   i think that love allows for forgiveness   don't you   patrick   more lies  what  more secrets   our whole life  all lies  don't touch me   patrick  i love you   i've always loved you  i did this       i have to go    liv   it's done  everybody loses  let it go   liv  please   what do you imagine that there is left to say     everything    or nothing   it's not an act of love   please try to understand   i understand  i understand that you're a liar   and that you have cost us everything that mattered in this damn world   i'm gonna head down to the u s  attorney's office with the list   hey  sometimes one gets away from us   think of it this way   list gets out  potential clients  every one of these guys   yeah   there's a lot of power up on this wall   harrison   sunny day   hardwood floors   trip to the islands   do you speak greek   gentlemen  thank you for coming   i realize you may not be united ideologically  but thankfully   screwing around seems to be a bipartisan effort   and you all have one thing in common   the services of my client  sharon marquette   and while the two of us don't care how you spend your free time   your constituents might   i think we can all be in agreement  that this small business owner should not be unduly harassed  by the law  am i right   lady  i have no idea what you think you're talking about   but i have a dinner to get to  so if you'll excuse me   oh  charlie   she's talking about how you like to go around the world  dear   twice in one night  if you take your pills   glad to see we're all in agreement   and i'm gonna need just one more thing   my reversal on judge keating  is a simple matter of reviewing the facts  and my personal feeling that he's the best man for the job   just tell me who was on the list   you know i can't do that   i mean  i can guess who was on it  given the long list of calls my boss got  right before he ordered me to drop the case   david  you got what you wanted  everybody wins   she's out of the business  liquidating her assets   buying a place in florida with extra bedrooms for the grandkids   the stain on the district's moral landscape is gone   right   unless you're not actually a white hat and what you were after  was the high profile  fame and fortune thing all along   you realize  don't you  that this is why we can never be friends   and lo  the day was saved by olivia pope  as usual   you know that there are 13 arrows in the eagle's left claw   to represent the 13 states  actually it's 13 everything   on the olive branch   olivia helped us  she's not against us   really  you're not talking to me now   the leader of the free world is standing on the presidential seal  in the oval office  slightly inebriated   i think that would warrant a lecture or at least some words  from his majesty cyrus beene  king of me   what do you want me to say  you won't tell me anything   i'm obviously not someone you trust   so  you just stand there alone on your presidential seal  have a party   i know i don't get to do what other men do   above reproach my whole life   i'm not john edwards  i get it   wear the crown  and that's fine  there's a price   but liv  is the love of my life   and she won't even talk to me   okay   we do not talk about this tomorrow   you hate scotch   i do   but i don't tonight  not with you   and we won't talk about it tomorrow   you're on my side   i'm on your side  mr  president   you think reagan did this  hell  roosevelt   you know nixon and clinton did   but carter and truman   i'm sorry i called you so late   i don't know  i just got scared  like maybe somebody was watching my place   i know that sounds crazy   that's okay   a reporter called my parents  asked them why i wanted to kill myself   they were having dinner   it's already happening  isn't it   i was in trouble once  a lot of people wanted to     i was in trouble   i was alone and it was awful   but if i had had someone  someone who knew what i should say   what i should do   i would have given anything to have that person by my side   and olivia pope  she wears the white hat   i'm here  okay  but we do this on my terms   you'll be glad you came  i promise   hello   hello     what are you doing here    quinn  who's this   the reporter from the hospital  gideon  what are you doing here   i need a quote for my story   your story  you don't have a story  you don't have anything  so go home     no    excuse me   she tried to kill herself the day after she quit working for the president   and she lied about who she works for  and now they're both here in this office with you   and i might just be a metro reporter for a dying newspaper   but you're olivia pope   so  no  no  i didn't have a story  but now     now i do   sync and corrections by majtjkong
