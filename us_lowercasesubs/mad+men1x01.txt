that mean what i think it means   because i'm familiar with most of your ideas   i'm having a situation with my cigarette account   you really are here to talk   the trade commission is cracking down  on all of our health claims   i getreader's digest   this is the same scare you had five years ago   you dealt with it   i know i slept a lot better   knowing doctors smoke   well  that's just it   the whole  safer cigarette  thing is over   no more doctors  no more testimonials   no more cough free  soothes your t zone   low tar  low nicotine  filter tip   nothing   all i have is a crush proof box  and  four out of five dead people smoke your brand     is this the part where i say    don draper is the greatest  ad man ever   and his big  strong brain  will find a way to lead the sheep  to the slaughterhouse    i don't want to go to school tomorrow   you gonna pitch to me or not   midge  i'm serious  i have nothing   i am over  and they're finally gonna know it   next time you see me   there'll be a bunch of young executives picking meat off my ribs   that's a pretty picture   what's your secret   nine different ways to say      i love you  grandma     we should get married   you think i'd make a good ex wife   i'm serious   you have your own business   you don't mind when i come over   what size cadillac do you take   you know the rules   i don't make plans  and i don't make  breakfast   sterling's having the tobacco people in  in nine hours  and i have nothing   people love smoking   there's nothing that you  the trade commission   orreader's digest can do to change that   there's this kid who comes by my office every day   looks where he's gonna put his plants   is he handsome    uh  not right away   pal  could you take the long way up   i am really enjoying the view here   you going to campbell's bachelor party   yeah  i want to be there before they tie  an anchor around his neck and drag him out to sea   i hear she's a nice girl   eh  who wants that   what did you do that for   she'll probably be assigned to one of us   then she'll know what she's in for   you got to let them know what kind of guy you are   then they'll know what kind of girl to be   i have a feeling we won't be going to your bachelor party soon   yeah  well  compared to campbell  i'm a boy scout   excuse me  is he expecting you   he's not expecting anything   oh  honey  don't worry  i'll get home safely   i have an important appointment right now   so why don't you go shopping or something   take your mother to lunch   tell her it was my idea   wow  he's good   it's just a bachelor party  dear   no  i really don't know what they have planned   but judging from the creative brain power around here   we'll probably end up seeing my fair lady   i'll tell you what   i'll drop by your place on my way home   your mother can check under my fingernails   of course i love you   i'm giving up my life to be with you  aren't i   what a great gal   i tell ya  boys  she stole my heart   and her old man's loaded   now  this is the executive floor   it should be organized  but it's not   so you'll find account executives  and creative executives all mixed in together     please don't ask me the difference    great   hopefully  if you follow my lead  you can avoid some of the mistakes  i've made here     hello  joan    like that one     so how many trains did it take you    only one  but i got up very early   in a couple of years  with the right moves   you'll be in the city with the rest of us   of course  if you really make the right moves   you'll be out in the country  and you won't be going to work at all   you'll be here just across the aisle from me   we'll both take care of mr  draper for the time being   i don't know what your goals are   but don't overdo it with the perfume   keep a fifth of something in your desk   mr  draper drinks dry   also  invest in some aspirin  band aids   and a needle and thread   rye is canadian  right   you better find out   he may act like he wants a secretary   but most of the time  they're looking for something  between a mother and a waitress   and the rest of the time  well     go home  take a paper bag   and cut some eyeholes out of it   put it over your head  get undressed   and look at yourself in the mirror   really evaluate where your strengths  and weaknesses are  and be honest   i always try to be honest   good for you   now  try not to be overwhelmed by all this technology   it looks complicated   but the men who designed it made it simple enough for a woman to use   i sure hope so   at lunch  pick up a box of chocolates   a dozen carnations  and some bath salts     i'll explain later    thank you  miss holloway   you're really wonderful for looking out for me this way   it's joan   and listen  don't take this  the wrong way  but a girl like you   with those darling little ankles   i'd find a way to make 'em sing   also  men love scarves   good morning  mr  draper   oh  and mr  sterling   how are you   morning  girls   you look like a hundred bucks  long night   it's not this tobacco thing  is it   it's been on my mind   yeah  well  i should hope so   lee garner  his father  the whole lucky strike family  will be here at 4   you worried   no   if i was worried  i'd ask you what you've got   but i'm not  so i'm just going to assume you've got something   which means you should be worried   so you came here because you wanted to watch me get dressed   no  i wanted to make sure you were here   in body  give me about a half hour  for the rest of it   oh   how do i put this   have we ever hired any jews   not on my watch   that's very funny  it's not what i meant   we've got an italian   salvatore  my art director   that won't work  sorry   most of the jewish guys work for the jewish firms   yeah  i know   selling jewish products to jewish people   that's very good   it's just that our 11 00 is with menken's department store  and i wish we had someone to make them fortable   want me to run to the deli and grab somebody   you missed a button   ah  look at you  gidget   still trying to fill out that bikini   summer's coming   without the medical claims  all we have is a white box  with a red spot on it   my neighbor posed for that   believe me  he always looks very relaxed   of course  he doesn't smoke   had him hold a pencil   if i know these guys  you're better off with a little sex appeal   can you give me a woman in a bathing suit   put her next to your guy   a sexy girl   i can do that   give you a chance to get a real model   oh  i love my work   speaking of sexy girls  are you going to pete's  bachelor party   i'm not really big on those things   tell me about it   it's so embarrassing   if a girl's gonna shake it in my face   i want to be alone so i can do something   should we drink before the meeting or after   or both   so    that's it  huh   relax   don't be short with me   you're the writer   i thought it was worth a try   greta guttman is here to see you     send her in    oh  great   now we get to hear from our man in research   mr  draper  mr  romano  you both seemed more relaxed  than i expected   do you have some kind of surprise for the tobacco people   i'm doing my own research   if you're planning to continue with medical testimony   you'll only be inviting further government interference   we must police ourselves     there's your slogan    the medical thing is dead     we understand that    yes  dead   an apt choice of words  considering the public  is convinced that cigarettes are poisonous   if we can't insist that they're not   i believe my most recent surveys have provided a solution   we can still suggest that cigarettes are part of american life   or too good to give up   or  most appealing  an assertion of independence   so  basically  if you love danger  you'll love smoking   we can put a skull and crossbones on the label   i love it   before the war  when i studied  with adler in vienna  we postulated  that what freud called the death wish  is as powerful a drive as those for  sexual reproduction and physical sustenance   freud  you say   what agency is he with   we're supposed to believe  that people are all living one way  and secretly thinking the exact opposite   that's ridiculous   let me tell you something  miss guttman     doctor   dr  guttman   psychology might be great at cocktail parties   but it so happens that people were buying cigarettes  before freud was born   the issue here isn't why should people smoke   it's why should people smoke lucky strike   suggesting that our customers have a     what did you call it   a death wish   i just don't see that on a billboard   so what ifreader's digest says they're dangerous   they also saidbambiwas the book of the century   there's no proof   there's conclusive proof that none of these  low tar  low nicotine  or filtration systems  have any effect on the incidences  of lung cancer   just give me the damn report   i think you'll find it very convincing   i'm sure i will   you're the one who found all of our medical testimonials in the first place     that's true  mr  drape but i      has anyone else seen this   of course not  it's your account   good   i don't want to hear about it anymore   i'm sorry  i just find your whole approach perverse   good luck at the meeting   i'm sure it will be a quick one   sal  i'll take that drink now   mr  draper   excuse me   mr  draper   i'm sorry to wake you  but mr  campbell is outside   he doesn't know i'm sleeping in here  does he     no  sir    that's good   who are you   i'm peggy olson  the new girl   can you go out there and entertain him   i know it's my first day  and i don't want to seem uncooperative  but do i have to   i see your point   i brought you some aspirin   send him in   you look like a hundred bucks   ready to go sweet talk some retail jews   you are tough to take first thing in the morning  pete   i've never had any complaints   speaking of which  who's your little friend here   she's the new girl   you always get the new girl   management gets all the perks   where are you from  honey   miss deaver's secretarial school   top notch   but i meant where are you from  are you amish or something   no  i'm from brooklyn   well  you're in the city now   it wouldn't be a sin for us to see your legs   if you pull your waist in  you might look like a woman   is that all  mr  draper   hey  i'm not done here   i'm working my way up   that will be all   peggy  right   yes   oh  and it's time for your 11 00 meeting   oh  and sorry about mr  campbell here   he left his manners back at the fraternity house   she's a little young for you  draper   the future mrs  pete campbell is a very lucky woman     when's the wedding again    sunday   did ken tell you about the bachelor party tonight   he sure did   so do i get first crack at her   word is she took down more sailors thanthe arizona   how old are you  pete   i just turned 26   i bet the whole world looks like one great big brassiere strap  just waiting to be snapped   you are good with words  draper   campbell  we're both men here  so i'm gonna be direct   christ  are you already sleeping with her   advertising is a very small world   and when you do something like malign the reputation  of a girl from the steno pool on her first day   you make it even smaller   keep it up  and even if you do get my job   you'll never run this place   you'll die in that corner office   a mid level executive with a little bit of hair  who women go home with out of pity   want to know why   because no one will like you   oh  here are our miracle workers now   you know pete campbell  of course   your account executive if you choose to do business with us   and this handsome fellow is don draper   the best creative director in new york   well  at least the building   a pleasure to meet you     sorry about that    i'm rachel menken   oh  uh  sorry  i was expecting     you were expecting me to be a man   my father was  too   and you are   why  don  you remember david cohen  from the art department   of course  david   one of the rising stars here at sterling cooper   why don't we make ourselves comfortable   miss menken  you can tell us what you have in mind   wonderful   that's very subtle   isn't that your shirt   had to go all the way to the mailroom  but i found one   so you must be peggy olson   joan holloway sent you over   she's a great girl  how is joan   she sends her regards   she's a lot of fun   must be a scream to work with her   yes  it's pretty terrific   try to make yourself comfortable   relax   i see from your chart  and your finger   that you're not married   that's right   and yet you're interested in the contraceptive pills   well  i was     no reason to be nervous   joan sent you to me because i'm not here to judge you   there's nothing wrong with a woman being practical  about the possibility of sexual activity   spread your knees   that's good to hear   although  as a doctor  i'd like to think  that putting a woman in this situation  is not gonna turn her into some kind of strumpet   slide your fanny toward me  i'm not gonna bite   i'll warn you now  i will take you off this  medicine if you abuse it   it's for your own good  really   the fact is  even in our modern times   easy women don't find husbands   i understand  dr  emerson   i really am a very responsible person   i'm sure you're not that kind of girl   now  joan     i'm just kidding along here  you can get dressed   i'm gonna write you a prescription for enovid   they're  11 a month  but don't think  you have to go out and become the town pump  just to get your money's worth   excuse my french   so what don is saying is that through  a variety of media  including a spot during  the danny thomas show  if you can afford it   we could really boost awareness   then  a 10  off coupon in select ladies' magazines  will increase your first time visitors   once we get them into the store   the rest     is kind of up to you   mr  draper  our store is 60 years old   we share a wall with tiffany's   honestly  a coupon   miss menken  coupons work   i think your father would agree with the strategy   he might  but he's not here because we just had our lowest sales year ever   so i suppose what i think  matters most right now   miss menken  why did you come here   there are a dozen other agencies  better suited to your    needs   if i wanted some man who happened to be from the same     village as my father to manage my account   i could have stayed where i was   their research favors coupons  too   it's not just research  miss menken   housewives love coupons   i'm not interested in housewives   what kind of people do you want   i want your kind of people  mr  draper   people who don't care about coupons  whether or not they can afford it   people who are coming to the store because it is expensive   we obviously have very different ideas   yes  like the customer is always right   gentlemen  i really thought you could do better than this   sterling cooper has a reputation for being innovative   miss  you are way out of line   don  please  let's not get emotional here   there's no reason we can't talk this out   talk out what  this silly idea that people are gonna come  to some store they've never been to because it's more expensive   it works for chanel   menken's is not chanel   that's a vote of confidence   what don's saying is  chanel is a very  different kind of place   it's french  it's continental  it's     not just another jewish department store   exactly   you were right  roger  this place really runs on charm   this is ridiculous   i'm not gonna let a woman talk to me like this   this meeting is over  good luck  miss menken   hey  don  i don't blame you   she was way out of line   adding money and education  doesn't take the rude edge out of people   roger's not gonna be happy  so i guess that's good for you   i'm not gonna pretend i don't want your job   but you were right  i'm not great with people   and you are  i mean  not counting that meeting we were just in   so i'm kind of counting on you to help me out   there's plenty of room at the top   look  i'm sorry i was so hard on you before   it's just this damn tobacco thing   you'll think of something   a man like you i'd follow into combat blindfolded   and i wouldn't be the first   am i right  buddy   let's take it a little slower   i don't want to wake up pregnant   dr  emerson's a dream  isn't he   he seemed nice   he has a place in south hampton   i'm not saying that i've seen it   but it's beautiful   now  don't be nervous  but this is  the nerve center of the office   you and your boss rely on the willing and  cheerful cooperation of a few  skilled employees   never snap  yell  or be sarcastic with them   and above all  always be a supplicant   i know you girls are busy  but we've got a new one   peggy  this is marge  nanette  and ivy   i brought you some things   i guess a sort of  getting to know you  gift   well  aren't you a sweetheart   if i know joan  the candy's for me   joan  you're not fair   you know she has to lose 8 pounds  by the christmas party   i think you look great   that's because i'm sitting down   you can come back and visit any time you want  honey   who does she work for   don draper   they got rid of eleanor   she moved on   draper wasn't interested   well  she couldn't get a call through   rude little thing   i see that you've got your hands full   don't want to be a bother   nice meeting you   hey  you have great legs   i bet you mr  draper would like them if he could see them   sterling cooper  how may i direct your call   i just don't know what we have to do  to make these government interlopers happy   they tell us to make a safer cigarette   we do it  and then suddenly  that's not good enough   might as well be living in russia   mm  damn straight   you know  this morning i got a call  from my competitors at brown   williamson   and they're getting sued by the federal government  because of the health claims they made   yeah  we're aware of that  mr  garner   but you have to realize that through the manipulation of the mass media   the public is under the impression that your cigarettes are linked to     certain fatal diseases   manipulation of the media   hell  that's what i pay you for   our product is fine   i smoke 'em myself   my granddad smoked 'em   he died at 95 years old   he was hit by a truck   i understand  but our hands are tied   we're no longer allowed to advertise that lucky strikes are safe   what the hell are we gonna do   we've already funded our own tobacco  research center to put this whole  rumor to rest   and that's a very good start   but it may not affect sales   don  i think maybe that's your cue   well  uh     i have been  uh     thinking quite a bit about this   and  uh     i mean  you know i'm a lucky strike man from way back  so     i might have a solution   at sterling cooper  we've been pioneering  the burgeoning field of research   and our analysis shows that the health risks  associated with your product is not the end of the world   people get in their cars every day to go to work   and some of them die   cars are dangerous   there's nothing you can do about it   you still have to get where you're going   cigarettes are exactly the same   so why don't we simply say    so what if cigarettes are dangerous    you're a man    the world is dangerous    smoke your cigarette   you still have to get where you're going     that's very interesting   i mean  if cigarettes were dangerous     it would be interesting    except they aren't   that's your slogan    you're going to die anyway  die with us    actually  it's a fairly well established  psychological principle that society has a death wish   and if we could just tap into that   the market potential is     what the hell are you talking about   are you insane   i'm not selling rifles here   i'm in the tobacco business   we're selling america   the indian gave it to us  for shit sake   come on  dad   let's get out of here   the bright spot is  at least we know  if we have this problem   everybody has this problem   gentlemen  before you leave  can i just say something   i don't know  don  can you   the federal trade commission and reader's digest  have done you a favor   they've let you know that any ad that brings up the concept of cigarettes  and health together     well  it's just gonna make people think of cancer   yes  and we're grateful to them   but what lee  jr   said is right   if you can't make those health claims   neither can your competitors   so we've got a lot of people  not saying anything that sells cigarettes   not exactly   this is the greatest advertising opportunity  since the invention of cereal   we have six identical companies making six identical products   we can say anything we want   how do you make your cigarettes   i don't know   shame on you   we breed insect repellent tobacco seeds   plant them in the north carolina  sunshine  grow it  cut it   cure it  toast it     there you go  there you go   but everybody else's tobacco is toasted   no  everybody else's tobacco is poisonous   lucky strike     is toasted   gentlemen  i don't think i have to tell you  what you just witnessed here   i think you do   advertising is based on one thing   happiness   and you know what happiness is   happiness is the smell of a new car   it's freedom from fear   it's a billboard on the side of the road  that screams with reassurance that whatever you're doing     it's okay   you are okay   it's toasted   i get it   you had me worried   i don't know if you were drunk  or not drunk  but that was inspired   for the record  i pulled it out of thin air   so thank you  up there   you're looking in the wrong direction   so now that i've got you in the afterglow here   what do you say you reconsider this presidential campaign   i don't know  bunting and babies   that's hard work   i would make hash of it   modesty  that's adorable   consider the product  he's young  handsome   navy hero   honestly  it shouldn't be too difficult  to convince america dick nixon is a winner   mr  draper  you've got visitors   could you be a little more specific  honey   we heard you saved the day   aw  thank you  boys   i appreciate it   i told them how amazing you were   i'm still tingling   looks like you're all going to engage in a little mid level camaraderie   so i'll be on my way  don  thanks again for the home run   i love to come through   any chance you could patch things up with rachel menken   any way you can be as charming as i said you were   haven't you had enough of my magic for one day   she's worth  3 million   you're a whore   peggy     could she get us a little more ice   yes  mr  draper   just a minute   fellas  i think this party's gonna have to move elsewhere   we'll move wherever you want  but it's 5 15   the bachelor party's underway   i don't know   oh  come on  don  all hands on deck   aren't you gonna help give pete his big sendoff   maybe next time   come on  guys  don will join us later  right   if greta's research was any good   i would have used it   what are you talking about   i'm saying i had a report  just like that   and it's not like there's some magic machine  that makes identical copies of things   i still think she was right   have a great night  pete   congratulations   i heard you were amazing in the meeting   fear stimulates my imagination   i just wanted to thank you for a great first day   and for  you know     standing up for me with mr  campbell   first of all  peggy  i'm your boss   not your boyfriend   second of all  you ever let pete campbell  go through my trash again   and you won't be able to find a job selling sandwiches in penn station   he said he left his fountain pen in here   i didn't know   i hope you don't think i'm that kind of girl   of course not   go home   put your curlers in   we'll get a fresh start tomorrow   oh  and  peggy  i need you  to place a call   i want to see you here every 15 minutes  whether you have drinks or not   uh  every five minutes   let's live here   better do more than look tonight   do you have a girlfriend  salvatore   come on  i'm italian   is there some kind of party here   how did you swing it   they work at the automat   he pressed a button  and they came out   i do hope we're not interrupting anything   definitely not   well  i have the best seat   what are we drinking   more of whatever's making you the way you are   i love this place   it's hot  loud  and filled with men   i know what you mean   oh  my god  i can hardly feel it   i have a feeling you're like this all the time   i like to laugh   is that right   now  you stop that   you said you like to laugh   i mean it   it's    it's too     too delicious   i said stop it     what do you think you're doing    you know exactly   you know what  girls  i think we should go   oh  come on   you're hurting me   i'll be good   buy the girls whatever they want   so  uh  what do you fellas do   you're looking at the finest ad men in new york   hell  the world   for the lady  a special mai tai   and one whiskey neat   so you're going to ply me with drinks  and convince me what a terrible mistake i'm making   that is quite a drink   you got in trouble  didn't you   i shouldn't have lost my temper   and i certainly shouldn't have treated you  like anything less than a client   apology accepted   so you understand   now i do   it was  uh  refreshing  really   i mean  actually hearing all the things  i always assumed people were thinking   well  i'm not really as bad as all that   i was under a lot of pressure   another account   doesn't really matter   no  it doesn't   so  without making things worse   can i ask you a personal question   don't you want to get a second drink in me first   why aren't you married   are you asking what's wrong with me   it's just that you're a beautiful  educated woman   don't you think that getting married  and having a family would make you happier  than all the headaches that go along with  fighting people like me   if i weren't a woman  i would be  allowed to ask you the same question   and if i weren't a woman  i wouldn't have to choose  between putting on an apron  and the thrill of making my father's store  what i always thought it should be   so that's it  you won't get married because  you find business to be a thrill   that and     i've never been in love   she won't get married because she's never been in love   i think i wrote that once to sell nylons   for a lot of people  love isn't just a slogan   oh  you mean love   you mean the big lightning bolt to the heart  where you can't eat and you can't work  and you just run off and get married  and make babies   the reason you haven't felt it  is because it doesn't exist   what you call love was invented by guys like me  to sell nylons   is that right   i'm pretty sure about it   you're born alone  and you die alone   and this world just drops a bunch of rules on you  to make you forget those facts   but i never forget   i'm living like there's no tomorrow     because there isn't one   i don't think i realized until this moment   but it must be hard being a man  too   excuse me     mr  draper      don   mr  draper  i don't know what it is you really believe in   but i do know what it feels like to be out of place   to be disconnected   to see the whole world laid out in front of you  the way other people live it   there is something about you  that tells me you know it  too   i don't know if that's true   you want another drink   no   but you can tell your boss that you charmed me   so i guess we'll be seeing each other again   i'll be back in the office monday morning  for a real meeting   i'd like that   we're not buying anything   actually  for the first time today   i'm not selling anything   does peggy live here   hold on   do you know him   it's okay  marjorie  we work together   he's really drunk   it's okay  marjorie   so     what are you doing   nothing  just  uh  sitting in my room listening to records   i'm getting married on sunday   i heard that   you must think i'm a creep   why are you here   i wanted to see you tonight   me   i had to see you   marjorie   yeah  peg   i'm going to bed now   i called the office   they said you'd left   i didn't want to bother you   it's no bother   i just assumed you were staying  in the city again   there's a plate in the oven   unless you're not hungry   i'm not   i'll be right back   don't move
