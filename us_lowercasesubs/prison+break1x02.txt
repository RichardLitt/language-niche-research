previously on prison break   i find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell  mr  scofield   why do you want to see burrows so bad  anyhow   because he's my brother   so you get yourself tossed into fox river with him   to what    save him      and whoever it was that set me up   wants me in the ground as quickly was possible   look  the closer it gets   the more i'm worried that the bottom is gonna fall out of this whole thing   that's the son of a bitch that fingered abruzzi   someone found fibanacci   who was this someone   why'd you hire him   keep your friends close and your enemies closer   hey  come at me  john   i'm coming after you   i doubt it   i'm getting you out of here   it's impossible   not if you designed the place  it isn't   you've seen the blueprints   better than that   i've got them on me    you're anticipating every one of my moves  three moves in advance   you're a hell of a strategist  fish   you ever think about boston   sure   think you'll ever see it again   i'm a 60 year old man with 60 years left on my ticket   what do you think   i'm thinking about going   well  there's goin' and there's goin'   which one you mean   the one you think i mean   three days inside  and he's already thinking about turning rabbit   it'll pass   it always does   there's bigger things to worry about at the moment   i've been in here long enough to know it when i see it   the calm before the storm   whites and blacks are going at each other real soon here   everybody chooses sides  and a lot of guys bleed   there a reason   same reason you don't put cats and dogs in the same cage   they don't get along   hmm   what   toilet won't flush   so   means only one thing    the dirt shuts off the water  so you can't flush your contraband   we got nothing to worry about   says you   under the table     what the hell is this   insurance  white boy  now dump it   open it   so     tooling up for the race riot  are we   hand it over   rugheads and the billies   now  which side are you on anyhow  fish   that would be neither  boss   maybe you're gonna go extracurricular with it then   stick a c o   maybe   is there a problem here  deputy   got a shank in here   is this yours   you're not a good liar   come on  sucre  you're going to the shu   move along  deputy   i'm not done shaking this cell down yet   i said move along   in the old man's back pocket  are you   well  i got news for you  fish   he may run this place during the day   but i run it during the night   transcript  raceman synchro  travis  the hell were you thinking  michael   how are we doing it   the infirmary   infirmary   it's the weakest link in the security chain   as long as i get that pugnac   i'll get all the access i need   what the hell's a pugnac   it lowers my insulin levels to the point that i'm hyperglycemic   as long as the good doctor thinks i'm diabetic   i'll have plenty of time in there to do what i need to do   which is   a little work   a little prep for your arrival   that's the idea  anyway   the idea   there's a little hitch in getting the pugnac  that's all   they don't exactly stock it at the commissary   you're telling me this whole thing's riding on a bunch of pills   someone's working on it as we speak   now's not the time to be trusting a black inmate  michael   our relationship transcends race   nothing transcends race in here   i can't let you do it   good behavior  you're out of here in three years   gonna be a whole lot sooner than that   can't be done     can't be done  michael   no one's ever broken out of fox river   every single step's already been mapped out   every contingency   every contingency   you may have the blueprints of this place   but there's one thing those plans can't show you   people   guys like abruzzi    you so much as look at these cats the wrong way  they'll cut you up   as far as the rest of these guys are concerned  i'm just another con doing his time   staying out of trouble   your don't go looking for trouble in here  it just finds you   and when it does  we'll be long gone   this is madness   you can't even get out of your cell   not true   what  you got a key   something like that   wrong piece of real estate  fish   belongs to t bag   who   you best speak with respect  fish   man kidnapped half a dozen boys and girls down in 'bama   raped 'em and killed 'em   wasn't always in that order  either   does t bag have a real name   that is my real name   no  no  no  please    sit   so you're the new one i been hearin' all the rave reviews about   scofield   one thing's for sure  you're just as pretty as advertised   prettier  even   rugheads got you scared  do they   sorry   assume that's why you're over here   few days on the inside   any god fearing white man realizes the correctional system's  got a serious lean toward the african american persuasion   i hadn't noticed   they got the numbers all right  so they think they do as they please   we got one thing they don't    surprise   we gonna take the ball game to them real soon   it's gonna be nasty for a first timer like you   but we'll protect you  i'll protect you   all you got to do is     take this pocket right here   and your life'll be all peaches and cream   i walk  you walk with me   keep you real close  so no one up in here can hurt you   looks to me you already got a girlfriend   i got a whole 'nother pocket over here   i'll pass   i don't protect you   them rugheads gonna gobble you up like a plate of black eyed peas   i said no   then you best move  then   now   you come around these bleachers again   it's gonna be more than just words we're exchanging   know what i'm saying   excuse me   are you the tim giles that represented lincoln burrows   okay  if you're a reporter     i'm not a reporter  i know the defendant personally   huh  you family   not exactly   we were in a relationship a few years back   well  look  ma'am  i  uh     i i don't know what to tell you  i mean  the man was guilty   the prosecution's case was a slam dunk   because the victim was the vice president's brother   if you're suggesting that the federal government rammed this thing through   okay  i take offense to that  'cause i fought for that guy   that's not what i meant   the evidence was there   lincoln worked for steadman's company   he gets into a public altercation with the guy  so  he gets fired   two weeks later  steadman's shot dead   the murder weapon is found in lincoln's house   and the victim's blood found on his clothes   trust me  there are cases you lose sleep over  but  this isn't one of 'em   what about crab simmons   lincoln said he could exonerate him   why didn't you put him on the stand   the man's a five time felon  all right   he he    he had no credibility   so  you wouldn't mind if i paid him a visit   be my guest  but i don't think it'd do you any good   strange feeling  i don't know how to explain it   now  um     usually  my whole life  it's always been crazy   noisy   maddening  you know  in my head  but     right now  it's quiet   it's perfect   glad you came back   i thought about you the whole time   you know  i  uh  made a lot of mistakes in my life   i know that   i'm gonna make it right   i know you will   what are you doing   i want to remember this   no   oh  come on  oh  come on  v  please  just one   okay   easy  man   how we doin' on the pugnac   hey  i'm workin' on it   well  work faster  i need that stuff tonight   what's up there in that infirmary that you need so bad   you get me that pugnac  and maybe i'll tell you   uh uh    uh   thought we had an understanding   this here's for the family   you made it pretty clear you ain't blood   how 'bout you hand that over   nice looking piece of steel  bit of work   you could do some serious damage with it   question is  who was it you was plannin' on damaging   i seen you with the negroes  you know   well  maybe you're one of them milk chickens   all confused like   white on the outside  black as tar on the inside   maybe we ought to take a look at them insides and find out  hmm   girl scouts   is there a problem over there   think we'll just hang onto this  if that's okay with you   hey  i'm not gonna ask you again  let's break up the party  ladies   you heard the man  little dogie   get along   what's it take to shake down another inmate

someone in here knows where fibonacci is   and you're not doing anything about it   i'm working on it   well  you're not working on it fast enough   apparently  fibonacci's coming up for air again   next month  a congressional hearing   now  if he testifies at that hearing   a lot of people are going down   including me   now  i've known you a long time   our wives are friends   our kids go to the same catholic school   now  it would be a shame  if anything were to happen to your kids   i know my kids would miss them   you don't need to do this   i do   i'll get this guy   we'll get

the harder it becomes  so that's why i wanted to give you this   it's the  uh  surveillance tape of the garage that night   it was a closed trial  so no one outside of the courtroom saw it   i thought it could help you out     with what    closure   allen schweitzer   that name mean anything to you   should it   i don't know  you tell me   never heard of the guy   are you sure   positive   uh

the trigger   the guy was already dead   yeah  i know  you've told me a thousand     then listen  i was set up   i went there that night to clear a debt   crab simmons was on my ass for the 90 grand i owed him   he told me the mark was some scumbag drug dealer  and if i took it  we'd be clean   i never pulled the trigger   all i know is that somebody wanted me in the same garage as terrence steadman that night   why would somebody want to set you up   it wasn't about me  it was about him   steadman   yes   the guy was like a saint   all the charity work   the environmental progress his company was making     about the only person in this entire country who had motive to kill him was you   you came all the way down here to tell me how guilty i am   i don't know why i came here   you

request  a couple of days ago  on the burrows case   yeah  so   records show that you made a dupe of the surveillance tape   that's right   mind us asking why   it's for one of burrows' old girlfriends  man   she was under the impression that the guy was innocent   i figured it'd  you know  help her with closure   she's in possession of the tape now  then   don't pull that card on me
