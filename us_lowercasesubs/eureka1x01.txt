started right away  if a project at the facility was responsible   well  how long is that gonna take    uh  a few days  maybe a week   that's too long   well  you have a better idea  sheriff    yes  i do  you cease all operations until we figure this thing out   no  not with the appropriations committee breathing down my neck   it's review time  careers are on the line   whose career are you worried about    careful  sheriff  you're not the only one with influence around here     i don't want this getting out of hand    oh  no  it won't   not as long as everyone stays calm  does their job

either   look  whoever you are     call me taggart   taggart   i'm not sure if you realize this   but you've just assaulted and kidnapped a federal marshal   yeah  sorry about that  just doing my job   your job   what kind of job     can't say   right    what is wrong with you    lowjack   i got ya this time   hang on  you're a dog catcher    biological containment specialist   are you insane    sneaky little bastard   you you just shot that guy    it's a non addictive phenothiazine derivative   perfectly harmless   it's just a dog  for crying out loud   now you listen to me  friend   i once tracked a polar bear across the arctic tundra   dived with great whites off the barrier reef   hunted with the prides of the serengeti   but none of it     even begins to compare with what that animal's put me through   it's not just a dog  marshal   that's the devil himself   oh  yeah  he's stable   you've gotta be kidding me   no  he's totally wrong for you     you think     yeah    confident law enforcement professional seeks same     hello   i don't know if you've noticed   but johnny laws tend to be self centered control freaks   where's cobb   i want to know what's going on  i want to know now     see what i mean     is there a problem  marshal    i don't know  you tell me  i mean  one minute i'm driving  my delinquent daughter back to la  and the next i'm in the middle  of the freakin' twilight zone      why don't you just calm down     don't tell me to calm down   i've had it with you people  and i've had it with your crazy town   now you start talking   or i'll have 50 marshals down here by nightfall   i'm afraid i can't allow that   really    and just how do you plan on stopping me    hey  lowjack  if you're hungry  there's plenty of leftovers in the fridge   pudding  i got some cheese  i got some sauerkraut   but don't touch my sandwich   don't touch it  that's my sandwich   go ahead   hi  allison   we have a problem with the marshal   we should talk  i'm on my way   something's happening     what's happening     i don't know     sheriff     it's not good   it's really not good   no  no  no  no    no    son of a bitch   no   stop    no    no    sheriff    sheriff   oh  my god   sheriff    he's got experience  so what    the way i see it  we have two options  we can get rid of him or use him   i know my preference     he wrecked my cage    he found the kid   we would've found him eventually   smashed it to pieces     without cobb  we are gonna      he'll pull though  he has to   i built that cage with my own two hands   you'll build a new one   yeah  but not as good   jo  the guy's obviously good at what he does   and right now  we need every resource at our disposal   i still think it's a bad idea   marshal  come on  let's go for a ride   so  um  back there when you said  get rid of him    was that like     you know   buy him a bus ticket  get rid of him  or like  you know     first things first   standard nondisclosure agreement   it says that you will be charged with treason  if you tell anyone what you see here   a lot of people would like to get their hands on what i'm about to show you   sign it   where are you taking me   area 51    please  they wish they had our security   slow down   what are you doing        i think i'm blind    relax  that almost never happens   oh  man  what did i just sign    it started during world war ii  when einstein realized that our future  was in the hands of scientists  not soldiers   wait  einstein  like the  einstein    he convinced president truman to create a haven  where the world's greatest thinkers could live and work   and since then   most of our major scientific breakthroughs  have happened right here in eureka   hold on   put that on  please   so where do you fit in in all this    i mean  no offense  but you don't strike me  as the science type   i'm the government liaison  it's my job to make sure  the research being done here is  profitable   i was gonna say  productive    building a better tomorrow doesn't come cheap   guess that explains fort knox   that's section five  restricted to military projects only   military   you mean weapons    i couldn't say  you need nsa clearance to enter   well  so much for building a better tomorrow   life is full of compromises  marshal   the tradeoff is that eureka has the best of everything   school  housing  healthcare   i hope with the emphasis on the latter after what i've seen   there are always risks   you've had problems before     occasionally    like    global warming   i'd like you to meet one of out top scientists   simulation off  fargo    this is not level six    actually  that's level four   you mastered that last week   could recalibrate the system if it's too advanced for you   no  it's fine   did you need something    allison blake's on her way up   sheriff cobb was injured   really    better put on my sad face   hey  hey  hey   easy  easy   it's not a toy   you could put somebody's eye out   there's also a visitor  a u s  marshal   in eureka   maybe there's a dangerous fugitive on the loose     wouldn't that be exciting     don't be ridiculous   i know   what was i thinking    but then again     why else would he be here    what's all this for    professor king is trying to locate the point of origin   origin of what    everything   life   the universe   it all had to start somewhere   precisely where is  what i intend to find out   professor warren king  marshal jack carter   professor king is a nobel laureate  and noted astrophysicist   well  i'm captain  of my division softball team   sounded better in my head   i see what you mean   allison  how's the sheriff doing    he's still in surgery   but the marshal has agreed  to help us during his absence   oh  the marshal   oh  how generous   well  you must find all of this a bit shocking   i'm from l a   nothing shocks me   i see   well  almost nothing   well  perhaps we should just  jump right in    right  it's right this way   we carbon dated the trees in and around the event perimeter   they ranged in age from 12 to 1 200 years old   i take it that's not normal    what about that sounds normal    rapid aging like that can only be caused  by some sort of quantum anomaly   and then there's the temporal bilocation    of the rv    i'm sorry  come again    temporal bilocation  fargo    somehow  the back half of the rv became  momentarily isolated  from the front   it's caught in a different time stream  where  it ended up was a direct result of the earth rotating  beneath it during stasis   how is that possible    that's a good question  we're auditing all active projects   but so far   none of them seem related   including yours      hold on    that's all right  allison   the marshal's just being thorough   no  my search involves using  advanced pattern recognition software  to trace cosmological events so   unless    you're afraid of a little math     and what about section five    surely you have more than math locked up in there   details concerning s 5 labs  are all strictly classified   but as far as i know  nothing in there  could've caused this   as far as you know    no offense  but isn't our job to know    pushy   we should get back to work   allison    keep me posted on the sheriff's progress   we're all    we're all pulling for him   well  that wasn't at all awkward   you want me to help   this is me helping   just lay off of warren  okay   he's not one of your escaped felons   warren    sounds like someone has a crush on the teacher   really gotta start wearing my seatbelt   are you questioning my professionalism    it was a joke  but i forgot the dod doesn't have a sense of humor   maybe you're just not funny   look  i'm still trying to warp my brain around all this   i don't know squat about quantum physics  and to be perfectly honest   i'm not sure whether i can help you or not   but if you want me to try  then i'm gonna have to do my job my way   and for the record  i'm all kinds of funny   can i have my gun    thank you   son of a    stop the car   stop the car   don't wait for me     whatcha reading     popular science   it's all they have       crap     what are you doing out of your cell    i'm getting takeout for me and jo   it turns out we have a lot in common   like what    like fighting an oppressive patriarchal society  to express our feminine power   are you hungry   vincent can make anything you want     they don't even have menus here    marshal  you name it   i got it   yeah  what the hell   surprise me   one chef's special coming up   so     where have you been all afternoon    about that   we should talk   okay  please  just give me the bad news   what does that mean    well  the last time you wanted  to talk    you told me you were moving out   and    no  no  and the time before that  you said that grandma had died   do you see the pattern here    no  it's nothing like that   okay  yeah  it's something like that  the sheriff got injured  and we're gonna be here for a while   what    nothing   just go investigate something   they need my help   i can't walk away from that   since when    that's one fugu sashi   one cheeseburger  and a side order  of salt crusted yams and shaved white truffles to go   tell jo if she wants to trip me up   she'll have to do better than that   thanks  vin   well   i guess i'll see you when i see you   wait  wait  wait  wait  zoe  look   why don't you come with me to beverly's   i'll get you a room   touched   pass   zoe    i'll be done as soon as i can   you used to say the same thing to mom   i guess she finally got tired of waiting   see  zoe  don't    so  marshal   you're investigating this thing  right    i heard ned carver's cows got sliced and diced    just like walter's motor home    yeah   maybe it be best not to spread that around   trust me  around here it's business as usual   in fact  we've got a pool going on what's gonna get hit next   pot's up to about a grand if you're interested   yeah  look  i'm gonna have to take a rain check on what i ordered     what do i owe you     on the house   of course  if you have the inside scoop  on where things might be headed     right now  i'm more concerned with where things started   can i borrow this    yeah   hey  little man  is      archimedes  right     honey  who is it     okay  sweetie  go back inside   marshal  what's huh    what's going on    that's a nice kid   we chatted in the park earlier today   you trying to be funny    no   my son has autism  he barely speaks to the people that he knows   i'm sorry  i didn't realize   i'm sorry   it's  it's been a long day   i think i have a lead   but as much as i hate to admit it   i'm gonna have to run it by your professor friend   you called me here to look at a map    what are those    these are the rough locations of every reported anomaly   i'm well aware of vincent's tacky little pool  marshal   what  we're gonna start playing bets now   is that your idea    no  your pattern recognition software  traces cosmic events to their point of origin  correct    what if the events are a little more local    could that actually work    yeah  in theory it could   it would take a major recalculation though   what's the matter  warren   are you afraid of a little math    no     i'm not afraid of a little math    but it can't hurt to try though  right    no  no  it can't hurt   it's a little simple   but  okay  this'll take a little while     can i drop you someplace  marshal     no  i'll walk   could use the fresh air   right   see ya  archimedes   marshal   yeah   thanks   yeah   something wrong    no  nothing   okay   yeah  just a second  i just gotta take out the trash   oh  no   look out   go  go  go  go    let's go  let's go   come on  let's go    come on  come on  come on   go  go go    charlie  drop the damn rocks    let's go    i just got off an 18 hour flight from indonesia   so before you speak   consider the impact this call will have on your career  if it's not of monumental importance   it's eureka  sir   we're got a priority one situation   wake up the chairman of the senate appropriations committee   gather everybody in the sit room   tell them the topic of discussion will be   i told you so    oh  man    the car   breathe  walter   okay   now what happened    i got myself involved in something   what do you mean    the annual review is coming up next month  and i     i told you that i was struggling to make my deadline   yes  i know it was causing some tension with you and susan   they said they could help me   slow down  who is  they    i don't know   i've never seen  them    and they did help me   but now everything's falling apart   who's that    marshal   i saw a light on   hey   walter  right    how's the family doing    fine   and they're probably waiting for me   so     walter   we will talk tomorrow  okay      sure    okay   everything okay    emergency session   normally i try to keep my evenings free  but  as you're discovering   this town is anything but normal   like your little bed and breakfast   we all have our roles to play   now  i don't know about you   but i could really use a drink   why don't you make yourself comfortable    so how's his son doing    he'll be fine   you know  kids are resilient   it's the adults i worry about   especially around here   if i was stuck in this cracker farm   i'd probably need a shrink too   who says you don't    and i prefer psychotherapist   you know  maintaining relationships is     tough in your line of work   it helps to have someone to talk to   you do what i do   the job comes first   i imagine your wife might disagree     she knew what she was getting herself into    still  the     time away   the distance   it must take its toll on you too   especially with a child involved   well     i tried  a desk job when zoe was born   change to make others happy   you end up making yourself miserable   that's exactly what i told abby   but she felt you were choosing your job over them   yeah  and i told her it's not that simple   i mean  it's not just a job   i stop bad people from doing bad things   well  i'm sure that's a tremendous comfort  when you go home at night   alone   so you don't pull punches   i've counseled some prominent people  marshal   diplomats  dignitaries  even a few presidents   i knew that was him   they don't pay me  to pull punches   they want honesty   easy  marshal  it's us   where's beverly    is she okay    aside from a bruised ego   i never had a man fall asleep on me before   well   it's time to wake up     what happened     things have gotten worse   the diner  we had our first fatality   i was just there   with my daughter    she's fine   okay   what about king      any luck     that's the good news   he may have found the point of origin   where    come with me  i'll show you   so  you and beverly barlow    oh  we were just talking   is that why there's lipstick on your collar      i knew that    yeah  right   oh  thank god  i was just trying to call you  please  please  come in     what's wrong     it's    it's walter   it's just he hasn't been himself   he is so stressed out  and then after nearly losing brian  and that thing with the motor home     susan  susan   calm down  where's walter    okay  he came home late   very late last night   and then just locked himself in the basement   something went wrong with his experiment   and i think he's been trying to fix it   you should stay up here with me   walter   sweetie    you need to come out now  the police are here   walter    you gotta be kidding me   all right  let's see if mrs  perkins has the code   susan    doesn't anyone do anything halfway around here    hey  jo  any luck on that code    nope  but i found a key   oh   dr  perkins  it's deputy lupo   if you can hear me   back away from the door   maybe this isn't the best     way to do that   ladies first   i think we found our point of origin   that's not all we found   let's not shoot  the crazy end of the world machine just yet  okay    go  go  go   go    somebody order an invasion    all right  listen up   i want those seals checked and rechecked   this is a class three hot zone till i say otherwise   colonel briggs  first rangers  fort bragg     hello  jo  move on out    yes  sir     lieutenant     yes  sir    oh  congratulations  ms  blake   looks like you people finally  screwed the pooch but good   colonel briggs  what do you think you're doing    something i should've done the last time  one of your little science projects got out of hand   eureka is under dod jurisdiction   was under dod jurisdiction   now it's a matter of national security   which means you answer to me   okay  let's move that machine out of here   idiot   so you two are close then    you know  the boyish charm act works better when you're showered and shaved  yeah  it's on my  to do  list  so where are they taking that thing    where else    will somebody please explain to me  what we're dealing with here    from what we can gather  it's a prototype tachyon accelerator   in english  professor   i'll speak slowly for your benefit  colonel   a tachyon is a hypothetical particle  that travels faster than the speed of light   okay   no  that's not okay   nothing can travel faster than the speed of light or the whole concept  of linear time becomes meaningless   if walter perkins created  some sort of tachyon collision  then  time  as you know it   ceases to exist  and the laws of physics  break down at the most fundamental level   and if we don't stop this   no one will be safe   now this is why i hate this town   hang on  how could walter perkins  have even built this without anyone knowing    he had to break some     major protocols  i mean   this is a stolen sentex prototype   strictly  next gen  military hardware  so the question is     could walter have built this on his own and  where would he get a hold of something like this    section five    oh  i don't see how that's possible   but i guarantee you there'll be a thorough inquiry     you can count on it    all right  i've heard enough   now listen up   my orders are to contain this area   so anyone here stays here until we figure this out   this is briggs  start taking people down to the bunkers   women and children first   zoe   hey  jo  this apricot bath scrub is killer   where'd you get it    jo    jo  you there      get out of my way    i have my orders  sir   no one leaves     i'm going to get my daughter    i wouldn't do that  marshal   tell your grunt he's got two seconds before i make him eat that rifle   that grunt is a force recon commando  who can kill you a hundred different ways with his bare hands   the rifle is just his way of being polite     she's my daughter    i don't care     stand at ease  burke    i hate to interrupt   but we have bigger issues at hand   time is unraveling   the laws of physics are breaking down   now  correct me if i'm wrong  but  that's the kind of thing that not gonna stop at the city limits     is it     a rift of this magnitude  will continue to grow exponentially   unless     henry   is it possible walter was trying to create another  collision    when his machine blew    right  theoretically   the two events would cancel each other out  i mean  it's sort of like starting a     a back fire in a brush blaze   right  so if we can get this one up and running again     i've got some grade a hardware in the garage   not like walter what was using  but it should do the trick   except for one small problem   part of his formula was lost in the blast  i mean  without it  the accelerator is useless   are you telling me in this town full of super geeks   you can't one person who can do a simple math problem    it's not that simple  walter     was our top  quantum physicist   now he could've worked on this for months     what     years   i don't know     i could swear i've seen this before    even if we put  our top people on it  excuse me   it's not gonna be a walk in the park  i understand that     i need to borrow your car keys    okay     what are you thinking     trust me   do i have any choice    hey     watch yourself    okay  right  right  jo  i need to get out of here     do you think you can take him     please   he's force recon   hey  soldier boy   u s  marshal   dad      honey  hey    hey     you okay     yeah   what the hell's going on    there's this machine   and a missing formula  a lot of science stuff i can't explain   so what are we gonna do     we  aren't gonna do anything   you're gonna stay right here where it's safe   like hell  i'm coming with you   oh  zoe  i don't have time to argue   which is why i'm gonna win   okay   you stay by my side  you don't leave my sight  not for a second     you got it     yeah   hey  we need help   nice to see you too  marshal   nasty out there  huh    i think i can fix it   but i can't do it alone     how can i help     oh  actually   you can't   but i'm hoping he can   all right  this has gone on long enough   he just needs more time   yeah  like 15 years and a college degree   he's just a kid for crying out loud     just give him a chance    allison  maybe he's right   we all know kevin has special talents   but this is just too much  especially under these conditions   yeah   yeah  it's not working   here you go  buddy   give that a try   what are you doing    nothing   it's all him   oh  my    god   let me in here   he got it   he got it   well  i'll be damned   henry  let's get to work   easy on that   man  this thing is cold   easy   henry  remember groom lake    yeah  but this time we're sober   almost there   that should be it   lock it in  great  okay   okay  people  it's now or never   nonessentials clear out   people  let's get out of here   go  go    dreamworld  kid    all right   on my count  here we go   one     two     three     now    ring one   sir  it's been an honor working with you   you too  burke   now   ring two   oh  man   dad  i'm scared   i know   here goes nothing    on my count   one     two     three     now    henry  do i need goggles    no   walter   walter  you son of a     so  what about the machine    we'll take it back to the lab for analysis   and then    then we'll lock it away in a very safe place   i hope so   'cause i don't like this town   i think it's a powder keg   and i think you people get off on playing with matches   well  tell you what   to keep this country safe  was developed here   so when you're ready to give that up  you just let me know   you were lucky this time   but i'll be watching   you lied to me   allison  allison  it's not that sim     that chip walter had was stolen from section five  and you knew it  you put everyone's lives at risk   i don't know  how he got that chip  allison   but i promise you i had no knowledge of it   for your sake  warren  i hope not     trouble in paradise     fargo    they're ready for you   stay   sorry  sir   come on  we did this an hour ago  just do it  do it   you touched my eye   let's go   you've got serious power issues  norman   what a jerk   space shuttles    turn her over   no  no  no  remote   thanks   try to keep her on the ground     no  really    yeah   nice   now  remember what i said   games are okay  just don't play by their rules     ready to go     i am   you know  she's really very insightful   yeah  she should write a book   jo   thanks  for everything   tell the sheriff i'm sorry we missed him   tell him yourself   you're leaving us so soon  marshal    good to see you up and about  sheriff   should you be up and about    no  but don't tell the doctors     i owe you big  marshal    oh  no  just doing my job   no  you were doing my job   and you did it well  i might add   thanks   so  is this henry    yeah  henry     yeah     hi     hi    the man does good work   try to keep it on the ground   yeah   you too   adios  zoe   bye  sheriff   see you later   so what do you think    i think i'd like it better in black   you know what i mean   we could do worse   you know  zoe  it was wrong for me to leave you like that   i know it was rough   and that i wasn't always available     so      are you apologizing    well    no     yes  you are     no    you are  you're totally apologizing to me   all right   yeah   yeah  i am sorry   now   is there something you want to say to me    nope   well  you're definitely my kid   you do realize that's what got us in the mess    in the first place    what's that    you not keeping your eyes on the road   what were you looking at anyway    nothing   nothing at all   i still can't believe it   so you had no idea walter was involved  in some kind of corporate espionage    no  none   except     except what    oh  there were phone calls   sometimes late at night   from whom    walter wouldn't say   but i could tell that he was frightened   i think he must've been working with someone else   here   drink this  it'll make you feel better   thanks  you're so sweet   so  have you told anyone else about this    no  but    but i will   oh  susan   you have no idea how sorry i am to hear that   it took us a long time to find the right candidate   even longer for him to gain access to section five   walter was doing so well   and now   now i'll have to start all over again   i was so hoping you and i might become friends   jo   it's beverly   i'm over at the perkins'house   susan's committed suicide   yeah   okay   carter   these are special agents hicks and miller   department of defense   look  if this is about that thing  i signed  i didn't tell anyone   actually  we're here on behalf of the major     he was very impressed    you mean colonel  colonel briggs   no  major william cobb  army intelligence   he said you two worked together recently   oh  you mean the sheriff    with his recommendation  your security classification  and pay level will increase effective immediately   marshal   sir   i don't understand   relax  carter   it's a promotion   congratulations   define promotion    okay   not the promotion you were hoping for   no big deal   you can do this  jack   you can make it happen   jo  call henry   transcripts    and frm team  thanks to them  synchro   seth cohen and csivore
