   ditto buenos aires   too busy to check in  yeah   or alrey off to monaco   i'm spying  or was it majorca   ooh  or tunis    tunis kind of rings a bell   isis isn't your own personal travel agency   it doesn't exist just so you can  jet of to   whore island   that's not a real place   i have 50 agents who'd literally kill to move up  to your position   and if you don't square your  operations account by monday   they won't need to   your position will be vacant   sterling   sorry  i was picturing whore island   have i made myself clear   are you    you're looking for the answer  yes    yes

you're still a hatche t faced prick   mm  do you see that sign   uh  do you see that sign   well     that's why    so we don't get ants   because when your co workers put food in the  refrigerator  that's a bond of trust  okay   and if you violate that trust  or the food     there's my favorite section head   i am dealing with the break room problem   oh  good  you caught the  uh    oh  wait   i had something for this    the  pita predator   you know what   sorry  let's just call it what it is    food rapist   not a pretty name  is it   want some food that's supposed  to be cream filled  i offer  these delicious doughnuts   in exchange for a favor   a favor   after how you treated me    well your dolphin  pam   archer  she's down  all right   your dolphin  she's tapping out   i think she peed  i had to get three stitches   and i broke my watch   and i'm sorry for that   but i i need your help  pam   because i i'm   um   conducting  a mole hunt   gasp you should   because if you let me in the  mainframe  i'll drop these doughnuts   then you can pretend they're  marbles and you're a hungry   hungry      hungry hippo   hey  i know i'm supposed to be  up my own ass right now  but     oh  is that what you want   yep   because that's how you get ants   cyril  my favorite section head   what do you want  to apologize for my  behavior  and also to    what are you doing   oh  uh  just dicing veggies for dinner   i always make lana stir fry on friday   neat  listen    guess what we call it   stir friday   wow  it's actually better   it's all yours  so come let me in the mainframe   is this about your operations account   no  cyril   i'm on a top secret mole hunt   oh  yeah  pam mentioned that   w when    well  she called a minute ago   you know how pam loves to gossip   yeah  i need rug marbles  i know   so come let me into the mainframe   okay  but i need to  confirm this with your mother   no  no   i i mean  cyril  what if she's the mole   think about it  your own mother   think what that would do to me     if we had to kill her    archer      by stabbing her wrinkly neck     with a knife   yeah  i can't let you in there    can't  or  won't   either   and after i gave you  stir friday    that is much better  i know   but if you want to access the mainframe  i guess       you'd have to break in        break into the isis mainframe   which is obviously ludicrous  as is this baby corn   what is that about  archer   isis headquarters makes fort knox look like a  gingerbread house   only two means of ingress   the first  at street level   impenetrable after 6 00        the second  through an access door on the roof           inexplicably unprotected   but even if you zip lined  across  reached the access door   and somehow made it into isis  headquarters  you'd still have  to find the mainframe   but wait    it gets worse   inside  there are three  countermeasure systems   the first is pressur e sensitive in the floor   even a mouse triggers it   the second is sound sensitive   anything above a whisper sets it off   and the third system is  state of the art voice activation   cyri  figgis   so  obviously  it would be a lot  easier for me if you just  disabled all that when you left  work tonight  somehow   yeah   that woulke me     uncomfortable   god  everything makes you uncomfortable   just the tip  just the tip   just the tip   how was i supposed to know u' 're  actose intolerant   because i kept screaming it  well   and this    i'm just a secretary   i don't have access to security whatevers   then get them from cyril   how would i do that  seduce him or    or  pam    or both  i can't do that    can't  or  won't   either   that's how you want to play it   fine   are   you gonna pay for your lunch   just the tip  uh     actually  i don't have any cash   can you   get it   sorry  i also need cab fare   oh  ugly duckling        bawk  bawk        nothing  carol   now i have to break into isi  headquarters in a  9 turtleneck   and if it gets ruined  i'm gonna  make you drink heavy cream   you   carol   wow  that was actually pretty easy   thanks  new turtleneck   oh  f   oh  and thank you  duffel bag   jesus  what else could go wrong    exactly  you're not archer   that's what's so great about  you    that and the fact that  your mother died in a fire  what   i said   where are we on that stir agent kane   what   yes  confirmed   confirmed a naughty nelly's breaking our  after work phone rules   cyril  there's been a break in at isis   what   you think it's the mole   god  you and pam  pam's all right   okay  uh  i've got to go   but it's stir friday  hooray   but if i'm not here    yeah   because after three months of  whatever it is we're doing  i  just think it's a little weird  that you can't leave me alone in your apartment   i know i have trust issues  all right   but it's archer's fault i'm like this   and here we go   all those years of the  lying and the cheating and that  thing with the mayonnaise    it's fine   not to mention how  messed up he is about his mother   do you know he called out her  name once when we were    fi i i ne   and here we are  all fine   cyril  come on   now who's the naughty nelly   yes  hello  hi  who's this   cyril   figgis  i'm sorry   did you say   faggis   figgis   what is it  figgis   better not be pam  not  faggis    figgis
