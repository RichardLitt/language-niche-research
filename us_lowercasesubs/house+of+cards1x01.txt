 hey  what are you doing     jesus    did you get a good look   blue toyota camry  that's all i saw   that's the whartons' dog   aw  man   he's not going to make it  go see if they're home   shh  shh   it's okay   there are two kinds of pain     the sort of pain that makes you strong   or useless pain   the sort of pain that's only suffering   i have no patience for useless things   moments like this require someone who will act   who will do the unpleasant thing   the necessary thing   there   no more pain   it was a hit and run  i'm awfully sorry   he must have jumped over the fence again   look  steve is going to file the report on the car   and he'll put his people on it   we'll track them down   you look stunning  shall we   three  two  one     happy new year   oh  president elect garrett walker   do i like him  no   do i believe in him  that's beside the point   any politician that gets 70 million votes  has tapped into something larger than himself     larger than even me  as much as i hate to admit it   and look at that winning smile  those trusting eyes   i latched onto him early on and made myself vital   after 22 years in congress   i can smell which way the wind is blowing   oh  jim matthews   his right honorable vice president   former governor of pennsylvania   he did his duty in delivering the keystone state   bless his heart   and now they're about to put him out to pasture   but he looks happy enough  doesn't he   for some  it's simply the size of the chair   huh   linda vasquez  walker's chief of staff   i got her hired   she's a woman  check  and a latina  check   but more important than that   she's as tough as a two dollar steak   check  check  check   when it comes to the white house   you not only need the keys in your back pocket   you need the gatekeeper   as for me  i'm just a lowly house majority whip   i keep things moving in a congress  choked by pettiness and lassitude   my job is to clear the pipes and keep the sludge moving   but i won't have to be a plumber much longer   i've done my time  i backed the right man   happy new year   give and take   welcome to washington   you need a haircut   you think   a little trim   what are you going to wear     you mean for the meeting    for the announcement   gonna wear my navy blue  the one with the pinstripes   good  you look handsome in that suit   i don't know if they'll announce it  before your board meeting   well  as long as i can say the donation is coming   as soon as it's official   sancorp will write you a check   this is going to be a big year for us   you know  the meeting's on tuesday   you're gonna wanna start with something     that's what i'm hearing   community of what   or i could say immigration  banking  or education   but none of my regular sources can confirm that   because they don't know   or because they're not talking   because they don't know   keep at it  get me something   sorry  sorry  mr  hammerschmidt   zoe     barnes    right   did it take him a year to remember your name   longer   good morning  lucas   what can i do for you  zoe   i am sick of the fairfax county council   you tell me every day   move me online  my own blog     first person  subjective  500 words     not going to happen    i'll go underground   back rooms  the urinals   i'll win over staff members on the hill     they need a place to vent    a gossip column   no  we lift the veil  what's really going on   this is the washington herald  zoe   it's not tmz   do you know how many people watch tmz   i couldn't care less   which is why print journalism is dying   then it'll die with dignity  at least at this paper   you are stuck in the 20th century  lucas  you lack imagination   maybe so  but right now   i don't need imagination  i need copy   your nights and weekends are yours   i applaud whatever you want to do   as long as it's not on my time     you're telling me to get back to work    i am   what you're really telling me is to fuck off   i'm telling you both   it's mr  chapman already from province trust   hold my calls  christina   henry  it's good to see you     how long are you in town for    just today   well  you gotta come back down for the inauguration   i can hook you up   how about you hook me up with the zoning laws you promised to get changed   we got 12 million sitting in escrow  for an empty lot we can't build on   i know  but you gotta understand   it's a local municipal issue   i can't just pick up the phone     you can't  because that's not what you led us to believe  when you begged for 50 grand in donations   right  i     one second   christina  i said no calls   not while i'm meeting with mr  chapman   the president elect   i    do you mind   no  go ahead  please   uh  put him through  christina   ahem   mr  president elect   thank you  uh  yes  we were  uh     we were pleased to win by double digits   absolutely  anything you need   i need you to put your long  wet  talented tongue  between my thighs  and make me squeal like monica lewin     me  too  me  too   okay  thank you  sir   i'm so sorry  uh  where were we   walker     what's he like   mr  president elect running late   no  he couldn't make it  i'll brief him  though   okay  this is the memo i've drafted  on our middle east policy we've been developing   now  i want to borrow from reagan   i'd like to coin the phrase  trickle down diplomacy      that way      frank  i'm going to stop you there   we are not nominating you for secretary of state   i know he made you a promise   but circumstances have changed   the nature of promises  linda   is that they remain immune to changing circumstances   garrett has thought long and hard about this   and he's decided we need you to stay in congress   when was this decision made   and why wasn't i part of the conversation   i'm sorry  frank  if it had been up to me   i wouldn't have waited this long to tell you   so  you knew you were going to do this   it has been an evolving discussion   it's a chicken shit move     frank      i was vetted     was that a ruse    no   let's be absolutely clear   you wouldn't have won without me   you're right  but now we have to lead   and that means making tough choices   as you know  education is a top priority for us   a complete federal overhaul   but it's not just education  frank  congress is split   we need you there more than we need you in the state department   i got you hired  linda   i know   donations  endorsements   i wrote the campaign's  entire foreign policy platform   i bring years of foreign affairs committee     frank  please   i want to speak to walker personally   the decision is made   we need you  frank   will you stand beside us or not   of course  if that's what the president wants   i'm very glad to hear that   i'm curious   if not me  then who   michael kern   michael kern   well     that is an excellent choice   can you make it more clear   i just want to make sure it doesn't look like  we're neglecting our domestic     no  no  no  no  i'm going to say  that we're expanding our mission   okay   and we're bringing on a new organization to help us   do you know which one yet   i'm still looking into a few options  but  um   tell me  what did we agree on   that we could hire how many new people  six     six  maybe seven    hmm   we'll have enough   ooh  it's exciting  huh   this  uh  new direction we're heading   i just don't know where we're going to fit all the people   well  do you think we have to look into additional space   no  no  no  no  i'll find a way   okay  so make the changes to the powerpoint   and let's meet again at 2 30   okay   leave a message for frank underwood   it's me   i feel like an idiot leaving messages like this   call me back   what is it  zoe   um     i know you're going to have your hands full at the white house   so if you need someone to do research or     or print out background     i think i'll be fine   well  if things get hectic and you need any help     so you can blog about rubbing shoulders with the big boys   what did lucas tell you   look  no offense  zoe  but i don't have time  to be anyone's training wheels   i just thought     no  i was actually offering to lend a hand     that's it    got it   thanks     claire    you didn't call     i was      you didn't call me  francis   nine hours  you don't not call me   not when it's this big   you're right   when have we ever avoided each other   i wanted the solution first   do you have one   not yet   this affects me  too  francis   and it's not the money i'm upset about   it's that we do things together   when you don't involve me  we're in free fall   i should've called you  and i didn't   what happened   she says they needed to keep me in congress   linda said that   walker wasn't even there   that's what really gets me   he didn't have the courage to look me in the eye   i knew you shouldn't trust that woman   i didn't  i don't  i don't trust anyone   then how could you not see this coming   i never thought they were capable   you don't usually underestimate people  francis   i know   hubris  ambition   you should be angry   i'm livid   then where is that  i don't see it   what do you want me to do  scream and yell  throw a tantrum   i want more than i'm seeing   you're better than this  francis   well  i'm sorry  claire  i am sorry   no  that i won't accept     what    apologies   my husband doesn't apologize   even to me   how long you been up   hours   i know what i have to do   good   we'll have a lot of nights like this     making plans  very little sleep   i expected that   it doesn't worry me   i'd better get to work   i laid a suit out for you upstairs   the navy blue one   i love that woman   i love her more than sharks love blood   president elect garrett walker has just     why do you think they went with him   we're too good  they can't afford to lose us in congress   he's had work done   chin tuck probably   definitely dyes his hair   do we say anything   no  god  no   not unless he brings it up   nancy     9 20      cancel everything   stamper  you're with me   now  look     they've done us a great favor  doug   we are no longer bound by allegiances   we serve no one   we live by one rule and one rule only     never again will we allow ourselves  to be put in such a position   walker and vasquez   all of them  i hold them all accountable     want retribution    no  no   it's more than that   take a step back   look at the bigger picture   i think i see what you're getting at   kern first   that's how you devour a whale  doug     one bite at a time   who would you want for secretary of state   give me a list of choices   and however we do this  we'll also need a buffer   you mean an errand boy   yes  someone we control completely   i'll keep my ear to the ground   good   i haven't eaten since yesterday   i almost pity him   he didn't choose to be put on my platter   when i carve him up and toss him to the dogs   only then will he confront that brutal  inescapable truth      my god   all i ever amounted to was chitlins    and he that shall humble himself  shall be exalted   matthew  chapter 23  verse 12   thanks be to god   i'd like to speak today  on the subject of humility   a lot of you have just won re election   if you hadn't  you might not be sitting here   and  of course  we should enjoy our success  and be grateful for it   but never let your gratitude sour into pride   you'll have many challenges ahead  over the next couple of years   and a person's character isn't determined  by how he or she enjoys victory  but rather how he or she endures defeat   nothing can help us endure dark times  better than our faith   claire   oh  hello  felicity     how are you    good  how are you   good  i'm sorry  it's just not right   oh   charles and i can't understand what walker was thinking   oh  that's very sweet of you  but really between you and me   i think francis is relieved   he just feels much more at home in congress   i would've bet a million dollars they were gonna pick you   well  it's a good thing you have a million dollars to spare   but you are  by far and away  the only choice   i appreciate you saying that   i mean  michael  come on  he's got half the experience     garrett is a smart man  he knows what he's doing   you're a bigger man than i  frank   you  uh    you want some of that wine   yes  definitely   man  this is some good shit  where'd you get it   uh  i kind of lifted it from the v i p  room  of the speaker's holiday party   i'm impressed  bordeaux  20 years old   oh  it seemed about right for you   ouch  why would you say that to me   i'm almost 30  that's practically ancient in your book   i don't discriminate when it comes to age   really  when was the last time you hired a 40 year old staffer   doesn't mean i wouldn't   well  as long as she's good in the sack     come on    well  it's true  isn't it   where is this coming from   you're not going to just toss me aside  for some slut straight out of vassar   so  we're having that conversation   it's been six months   it's not a little office fling anymore   you want me to say those three magic words   one of which starts with an  l      mm mm  no    okay   i'll say 'em   christina gallagher     lick my balls   oh  my    you bastard     hey    i love you   i love you  christina   i love you   now will you lick my balls   so  i'm curious   are we patrons  benefactors  or lepers   believe it or not  we're angels   i'm going to go outside and pretend to use my cell phone   go   can i have your jacket   yeah  here you go   are you going to bed   i'll be up in a bit   don't stay up all night   no  i'll be right there   thanks so much  i'll call you   wait  i thought you had a good time   oh  i did  i loved it   i've never been before   well  maybe i could come up   oh  ryan  you're so sweet   really   but if i was gonna fuck you  you'd know   thanks so much     she's here    send her in   it's quite rare for a president's chief of staff  to climb the hill   a gesture of respect  no doubt   or desperation   i'm guessing she'll say   donald blythe for education    let's see if i'm right   good morning  linda   thank you so much for making the trip up   of course  my pleasure     education    first things first   the seating chart for the inauguration   how do these two work for you and claire   wow   they come with a complimentary set of tickets  to the jefferson ball   claire will be over the moon   good  i'm so glad   so    education   we have donald blythe drafting the legislation     donald blythe  jesus    i know   so  you want a bill just two steps left of karl marx   i advised the president elect against it  but donald is the face of education   he's been pushing reform for 25 years   you want me to guide him to the middle   we need a bill we can pass   do i have absolute autonomy and authority on this   there's more   garrett wants the bill on the floor  in the first 100 days   he wants to make a pledge in his inaugural address   well  that's     that's very ambitious  linda   can we make that pledge    i can deliver     keep me posted    i'll talk with donald   i'll check in with you later in the week   terrific   did you smell that   the smugness  the false deference   she thinks i can be bought with a pair of tickets   what am i  a whore in post war berlin   salivating over free stockings and chocolate   what she's asking will cost far more than that   ferguson  too old     willis    too stupid     boyd    too queer   really   he's married with three kids   and wouldn't they be devastated   all right  what about catherine durant   cathy durant   she was vocally anti walker   she's got the experience   set up a meeting   hey     the donation from sancorp    hmm   the money will have to come from somewhere else   god  what    what happened   i've looked over the budget for fiscal '13   and we've allocated  we need to cut that in half   well  you're suggesting     evelyn  we're going to let some people go   that would be half of our staff   we have to carve out some room   but you would have to fire some essential people  who've been with us since the beginning   we are a charity   but not for our employees   you know  um  claire  i have held my tongue  about this whole international thing for a while   but i don't get it   i mean  we are really good at what we do   why do we have to try and be something we're not   because we've plateaued  evelyn   and it is time for us  for our entire organization     what  digging wells in africa   we don't know anything about that   which is why we have to bring in new people   this is the plan that i've proposed to the board   and we are moving forward with it   i'd like a list of names  please   claire  could we just think about this   i have thought about it   i've put a lot of thought into it     yeah  but i think that we can really      evelyn   you're the office manager   i need you to trust that i know what i'm doing   so please get me that list as soon as possible     oh  ma'am  you can't go up there    i'm sorry  i just       i just have one question    no  no  you gotta come     sir  i apologize  this woman       congressman    miss  you need to step away from the fellow     if i could just have one second    step away from the     who are you   my name is zoe barnes   i'm a reporter at the washington herald   it is after 10 30 at night  and this is my home   i do not allow any     we're part of a mutual admiration society   you're a fan of the symphony   well  more for the people watching than the music   it's all right  steve  come on in  miss barnes   it's strong   do you prefer it weak   no  the stronger  the better   there's no harm in looking   it's a cheap ploy   it's cheap but effective   well  you certainly have my undivided attention   good  the reason i'm here     oh  is foreplay over   i read somewhere that jfk never lasted more than three minutes   the point being   time is precious   powerful people don't have the luxury of foreplay   okay  so why are you here  miss barnes   i need somebody i can talk to   we're talking  tell me what we're talking about   i protect your identity  i print whatever you tell me   and i'll never ask any questions   and what makes you think i don't already have  such an arrangement with one of your colleagues   because if you did  you wouldn't have let me through the door   i've led a very long  very successful career  avoiding this sort of intrigue with the press   i can't see any advantage in starting now   but is there any disadvantage   sloppiness  for one   i promise you absolute discretion   so  we're talking about trust   use whatever word you like   words matter very much  miss barnes   you should care more about them  given your profession   then  yes     your trust   so  which zoe barnes am i to trust   the one who wrote about the fireman that married the meter maid   or the one who authored a very fine article  on a new jogging path in rock creek park   don't be flattered  i read everything   i'm better than what they have me doing     you know what that feels like    do i   you'd have made a great secretary of state   how exactly may i help you  miss barnes   you must know the administration's legislative agenda     what's coming up first    i may   will you tell me   what would be your guess     education    why   im immigration is too controversial   tax reform isn't sexy enough   everyone can get behind children     is it education    you might very well think that   i couldn't possibly comment     a hint    it's late  miss barnes     can we talk again    i hope you'll understand  that i wanna sleep on all this   i never make such big decisions  so long after sunset and so far from dawn   my cell phone's on the back   did you put miss barnes in the visitors' ledger   not yet     don't  needless to say    needless   hello   claire   this is miss zoe barnes of the washington herald   she was just leaving   very nice to meet you  mrs  underwood   drive safe   there's a lot of ice on the road   i will   thank you   does that work on anybody   does what   the pushup bra and the v neck tee   well  if it does  i don't know who they are   okay  relax  relax   license and registration   uh  the glove compartment  sweetheart   this isn't your driver's license  it's a starbucks card   oh  shit  sorry   sir  have you been drinking   no  i never drink coffee at this hour   i'm going to need you to step out of the car   hey  if i was speeding  you can write me a ticket     sir  step out of the car right now   look  i don't want to be a prick   but i'm a member of    of congress   i don't care if you're the king of china   china doesn't h ave a king   it's a communist  agua larchy      oligar     oliguarchy     let's go  out     you  too  sweetie    fuck  that's hard to say   ahem  hello   good   well  let's get him out       gonna fly high like a bird up in the sky right now          i've got a story  ain't got no moral          let the bad guy win every once in a while          i've got a story  ain't got no moral         mind if i join you   what the fuck is going on   i thought i was meeting with the congress     no  you're meeting me   it's 4 00 in the goddamn morning   i got a city council meeting     you've been police commissioner for what   almost a decade now   we're here to talk about my resume    mayor of d c   would look good on that resume  wouldn't it   we know that you've been angling to run for some time   experience is your strong suit   endorsement and fundraising  they're not   we can help with that   russo   russo  you're free to go   it was just a few drinks   it was enough to get pulled over   but i wasn't drunk drunk     were you alone    yes   say that to my face     hey  watch the road    say it to my face   yes    i was alone   you cannot keep doing this  peter   it's going to catch up with you   i know   do you think we can arrange two more at our table  for the jefferson ball     for whom    the holburnes   why on earth would you want them there   i'm going to need her money for the c w i   the staff cuts are just not enough   i'll talk to vasquez     how are we doing    good  progress   irons in the fire   i like irons   but i love fire   yes     ah   what are you     the bill is garbage  donald   tax increases  ban on vouchers  federal oversight     how do you expect me to get that through a committee   when linda told me to write it  she promised     i'm sure she said any number of things   forget what they promised you  donald   they want your name because it carries weight   well  my name comes with my ideas   i understand  but you've got to be reasonable   this isn't the great debate   it's about passing meaningful reform   maybe not everything you would've hoped  but help me help you   that's going to take time   i    those ideas  i've been developing them for     if it's time you need  i will buy you time   but you've got to promise me your next at bat  is going to give me something i can work with   okay  frank  i'll see what i can do   good  and  donald  don't let this get you down  all right   together we're going to do more than you've been able to do in 25 years   two things are now irrelevant     donald blythe and donald blythe's new draft   eventually i'll have to rewrite the bill myself   forward  that is the battle cry   leave ideology to the armchair generals   it does me no good   walker just nominated kern   it's a long road to confirmation     kern is a boy scout    nobody's a boy scout   not even boy scouts   what do you have   absolutely nothing   then what are we talking about   just asking a simple question   does the job interest you   why would you want michael gone   cathy  you and i came up together   the foreign affairs committee needs a secretary we can work with   someone who isn't afraid to stand up to walker when he's wrong   we need you   let's assume i am interested   i don't want to assume   i want to know     please hold   zoe barnes   anywhere you want  on my way   i'm gonna have to call you back   so sorry  i couldn't catch a cab  i had to take a train     just before you left my house     think back     what were we discussing   the president's legislative agenda   specifically   education  was i right   do the math  miss barnes     he needs a bill    sponsored by       you    be smarter than that     somebody with legitimacy    good   and who screams legitimacy and education     donald blythe    correct  the problem is     he's an old school tax and spend liberal   walker ran as a moderate   you think blythe would talk to me   he doesn't have to   wait  we're in a very gray area     ethically  legally    which i'm okay with     i just love this painting  don't you   we're in the same boat now  zoe   take care not to tip it over   i can only save one of us from drowning   he announces his education initiative on monday     half of the address is based on      i understand     do we need to take it out    we're fine  linda   but you just got through saying he has to start over   i didn't choose blythe  you did   you put him in my lap and asked me to work a miracle  and i will   now  have a little faith  linda   let me work with donald on this   i know what can be accomplished in 100 days   all right  frank  we're counting on you   good   now  i do have a little favor to ask   do you think i can get just two more tickets  for my table at the jefferson ball     drink    uh  sure  what do you got   whiskey  blend   if you're offering   so    how are things  in the city of brotherly love     we're getting by    oh  good   good  oh  i'm sorry     i made that neat  did you want      no  this is perfect   so  it seems you've been a bit irresponsible   what   don't play dumb with me  peter   save it for the ethics committee   drink up  you could use a little courage right now   you're not having one   it's a bit early in the day for me   is this about the other night   how do you know about that   i'm the whip  it's my job to know   look    look  they let me off   there's    there's no charges  it's all taken care of   honestly  peter   do you really think
