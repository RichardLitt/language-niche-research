   1 when you find that one person  who connects you to the world   you become someone different   someone better   when that person is taken from you     what do you become then   whatever he wanna do  you know   what  hmm   where'd you get that  in a cereal box   huh  you wanna see a real gun   forget you   every little punk is carrying now  anton   that's why your father wanted us to take the car home   relax   we're picking up new hardware next week   restore a little order   besides  when we take the car   we don't get to meet new friends   look at this guy    you didn't bring enough for the whole group   i have to teach you about sharing   aah   i'll need a statement from the bum  what hospital did they take him to   he declined treatment  we got video on it  though   you know  you could have done me a favor  and let those guys land a couple more punches   question for you   looking at that tape   i'd say you spent some time in the service   but you don't learn how to fight like that  in the regular army   so what were you  special forces   delta   i'm carter  you didn't give us a name   you know  it's funny   seems like the only time you need a name now  is when you're in trouble   so am i in trouble   i don't know  you tell me   you're the one living on the street   yeah  making that transition back can be tough   some guys i knew got a little lost   needed a little help adjusting   you need some help   of course  some other guys i knew   they'd done so many evil things   they felt like they needed the punishment   that sound more like your story   excuse me for a second   i'm here for my client   wow   wow  wow   your guy's prints were found  in half a dozen crime scenes over the years   open warrants in four different countries   who you got down there  carter   the angel of death   i appreciate the help  counselor   but who's picking up    the tab   our employer wants to have a word with you   do i owe you money   'cause i'm  uh     running a little short at the moment   you don't owe me anything  mr  reese   that's the name you prefer  isn't it   i know you've had several   don't worry  i'm not gonna tell anybody about you   you don't know anything about me   i know exactly everything about you  mr  reese   i know about the work you used to do for the government   i know about the doubts you came to have  about that work   i know that the government  along with everybody else   thinks you're dead   i know you've spent the last couple of months  trying to drink yourself to death   i know you're contemplating more efficient ways to do it   so you see  knowledge is not my problem   doing something with that knowledge     that's where you'd come in   and you can call me mr  finch   i think you and i can help one another   i don't think you need a psychiatrist  or a support group  or pills     what do i need   you need a purpose   more specifically  you need a job   eight million people   you know what they all have in common   none of them knows what happens next   someone is murdered in new york city every 18 hours   at the end of the day   one of these people will be gone   bad things happen to people every day   you can't stop that   what if you could   not the things that happen in the heat of the moment   but so many crimes are planned  days  weeks in advance   what if you could stop those   i've got a list   a list of people who are about to be involved  in very bad situations   murders  kidnappings   the people that are on my list   they have no idea that anything's about  to happen to them   most of them are just ordinary people    like her    thank you   her name is diane hansen   and this week she's at the top of my list   i don't know exactly what's going to happen  or what her role in it is   she might be the victim  she could be the perpetrator   all i know is that she's involved   i want you to follow her   figure out what's gonna to happen   and stop it from happening   so what do you think   i think you're a bored rich guy   i think that woman's probably your ex wife  or someone you rode in an elevator with once   and either way  i think i'm done   tonight police are looking for a homeless man  for further questioning   the unidentified man was originally believed  to be the victim of a violent assault  on the subway   but now police consider the man a person of interest  in a number of crimes nationwide   hey  sweetheart  what's wrong   jess  what's wrong   you need to understand  mr  reese   the information i have is incomplete   but it's never wrong   you need to know what it would be like  to be forced to listen to someone get murdered   and not be able to do anything about it   one three eight  dot seven x ray    too late   this recording is three years old   a woman murdered in this room by her husband   for the insurance   you were too late for her   just like you were too late for your friend jessica   you were halfway around the world  when she was killed   what the hell do you know about it   it's the truth  you left the government  because they lied to you   i never will   i think all you ever wanted to do was protect people   it's a wire tap recording   nsa or fisa  government   but you're not government   no  i'm not   i guess you could call me a concerned third party   you couldn't have saved this woman     or your friend   but you could have if you had have known in time   and that's the other thing i'm offering you   a chance to be there in time   it's not too late for her   you could help me stop what's about to happen   the question is  will you   sync and corrections by n17t01  what is this place   the decline of western civilization   the city closed half its libraries   budget cuts   this building was sold to a bank that i control   which promptly declared bankruptcy   so the property's in a kind of limbo   it doesn't exist   neither do you  i did a little digging   i recognize  mr  reese  that there's a disparity  between how much i know about you  and how much you know about me   i know you'll be trying to close that gap  as quickly as possible   but i should tell you i'm a really private person   drivers licenses    credit cards   six cover identities   funds to be replenished through a proxy corporation   just like when you were with the agency   when i was with the agency  i knew who was picking up the tab   this is your list   the list   yeah   but you don't get names  do you   these are social security numbers   and each of them map out to a violent crime   and all of these numbers represent     lost chances   i could be a lot more help to you  if you just tell me where you're getting these numbers   it doesn't really matter where i get the numbers   what you need to know is that the next number that's up  is hers   diane hansen   grew up in detroit   moved to the city after law school   single     she have any enemies    one or two   she's an assistant district attorney   best conviction record in her department   we have no idea when this bad thing might happen  huh   could be in a week  could be five minutes   that's why we need to learn as much as we can about her   how do you intend to begin   the slow way   cultivate a relationship  to allow you to earn the asset's trust   and the fast way   first  you break into their home  and go through all their stuff   email  financial records  personal effects   then you hack into their cell phone   as long as it's charged and has signal   you can use the gps to track them   you can use the microphone to listen into their conversations  whether they're talking on the phone or not   hi  mom  i'm sorry i haven't called you back     third step    you need picture   a wireless camera  and you can keep an eye on them  from anywhere   i know you're worried  i know  i'm fine   it is a tough job  but i can look after myself   you know that   she's tough  but she's scared about something   given hansen's job  we've got hundreds of people  who could be holding a grudge   i cut the list to two   the first is wheeler  her co counselor   they dated for a few months last year   she broke things off   you got time to talk  maybe i can buy you dinner   i'm busy  another time   is something wrong  i've been noticing lately    no  i'm fine  thank you  thanks   and 40  of murders involve  some kind of romantic relationship   wheeler's divorced  one kid   partial custody  alimony  career stalled   the second person i'm looking into is lawrence pope   the man hansen is currently prosecuting   pope's on trial for killing his friends  in a drug deal gone bad   stole  1 2 million in cash   pope's gang may be targeting her for reprisal   when we got there  the scene was colorful   five dead   one of them had managed to crawl ten feet to a phone  to dial 911   detective fusco  when you interviewed mr  pope   what did he tell you in his defense   he said that if he'd have shot the poor bastard   he would have shot him in the head   quote   same as i always do   unquote   he said he wouldn't have left him there half dead   blubbering for his girlfriend   no more questions  your honor   detective     you went a little off script in your testimony   you never told me about that conversation   and it could clear pope's name   what's it matter  we got the guy   it matters because it's my job  to make absolutely sure  that the wrong people don't go to jail   do you remember   excuse me  i thought we were on the same team   something's gone wrong with her case   hansen's on the move   she's phoning county lockup   arranging a meeting with pope   alone   isn't my lawyer supposed to be here for this   i can call him if you want  but the reason i'm here is  i don't think you murdered those people   i think somebody else was in the house  when that 911 call was made   somebody who told you what was said   which means you weren't there   is it somebody you're trying to protect   you gonna help me  is that it   the person who knows what happened that night  must be somebody you care about   is it your younger brother michael   pope's got a brother  it's in his case file   got it   did he see the real killers   you should leave this alone  lady   i can do the time   these people are evil  killing when they want   and they're protected from on high   you keep asking questions  they'll kill me  and my brother  and probably you too   whoever these people are  you can trust me   we'll take care of you and your brother   if the killers are out there  i'm gonna find them   whether you help me or not   it's my job  now  why don't you    bitch  you keep your damn mouth shut   or i'll shut it for you   i'm fine   okay  she's okay  she's okay   finch  you were right about hansen   whoever framed pope will be coming after her   and only pope's brother michael knows who they are   hi  mom  it's jessica   i'm just down in mexico with cindy   and i'll be back tomorrow  okay     talk soon  bye    cindy   yeah     i look like a cindy    yeah   i didn't tell her about us yet   it's been six months   i wish this weekend could go on forever   it already has  it's tuesday   yes  which means that you have to go back to the base   and i'm not gonna see you again for two weeks  which i hate   then ask me to stay  and i will   i'll quit  i'll quit     okay    i'll quit     then quit    i already did     what    yeah   i didn't want to take the chance  that you wouldn't be here when i got back   but first  we need some more tequila   unh   estamos recibiendo informes que unos aviones se han estrellado  contra las dos torres gemelas del world trade center en manhattan   hey  sweetheart  what's wrong   jess   what's wrong   uh  it's new york  i don't know  i don't know   something's happened this morning   is it a plane crash   i think it's two  i think it's two planes   all right  thanks   you went to see pope last night   yeah  i gave him one more chance  to turn in his accomplice  cut a deal   he give you anything   no  as usual   i'm  uh   i'm late   she's trying to track down pope's brother michael   he can id the real killers   and she's stonewalling wheeler   what  does she think he's involved   remember  pope said they were protected from on high   wait a second   turns out there's a good reason she doesn't trust wheeler   he might be working with the killers   and they're after michael pope   we better get to this kid before someone else does   michael   can i talk to you for a second   i've got a message from your brother     you don't know my brother    not exactly   but i know what you saw   i'm not the only one looking for you   you need to come with me   hey  hey  help me   hey  this man is trying to put me  in a taxi cab with him   he's trying to take pictures of me   what's going on   how you doing   michael pope's still on the subway   when he comes up for air   you can use the gps on your phone to find him   if pope's right about these guys   i'm gonna need a hell of a lot more than a cell phone   about that  i don't like firearms very much   well  neither do i   but if someone has to have them  i'd rather it was me   besides  my friend from the subway has a line on some   lightly used   steep discount            pop  what about this one   are you planning on buying that one   i was just showing it to    put it back on the table  before somebody else kicks your ass   have you guys seen the men's room   hey  anton   good to see you again   you know this guy   wow  that's some pretty serious equipment   have you guys taken a safety course   take you  for instance   you're holding that thing sideways   you can't aim it   and two  it'll eject a shell casing right into your face   see   i'm gonna hold on to these  while you guys get some more practice   have a nice day   who the hell was that   reese   i got a signal from your phone   tell me you found michael pope   he's the only one who knows who's coming after hansen   i found him  but somebody else found him first   listen   oh  mikey   you were gonna tell him all about us   weren't you  hmm   head uptown   are you hearing this    step on it   we're gonna put a couple in the back of his head   make it look like a gang thing   you gotta do something   relax   i'm on it   keep the change            you're crazy   we're both dead now   do you know who they are   i do now   cops  come on   what exactly have you gotten me into   i don't know   that's the whole point   i hired you to help me figure that out   here   i think we're up against a group of corrupt cops   stills is narcotics   him and his men get word of deals   they steal the drugs  the cash   and they kill all the witnesses   and they get fusco to frame up guys  like lawrence pope for the murders   exactly   i think their next target is hansen   but i don't know for certain   hell  i don't know anything for certain   because you won't tell me  where you're getting your information   when the towers came down   you were in a hotel in mexico   i was here   i was working   didn't even know about the attacks until that evening   you see  mr  reese  until that day   i had spent the better part of my life making myself very rich   suddenly all that money didn't seem to amount to much   after the attacks   the government gave itself the power to read every email   listen to every cell phone   but they needed something that could sort through it all   something that could pick the terrorists  out of the general population before they could act   the public wanted to be protected   they just didn't want to know how they were being protected   so when they finally got a system that worked   they kept it secret   so how do you know about it   i built it   but there was a problem with this machine   i had built it to prevent the next 9 11   but it was seeing all sorts of crimes   so i had to teach the machine  to divide the things it saw into two lists   relevant and irrelevant   events that would cause massive loss of life were relevant   so those would be passed along to the nsa or the fbi   and the irrelevant information   every night at midnight  the machine erases it   it was only later that i realized my mistake   that irrelevant list was eating away at me   so where's the machine now   what  the drives  who knows   government facility somewhere   but the machine   the machine is everywhere   watching us with 10 000 eyes   listening with a million ears   what did i tell you about sending email   three weeks  you could practically move in   never put anything in an email you cannot own   you gave yourself a way to communicate with it   i was building the government a tool of unimaginable power   i thought maybe an off switch would come in handy   so i built myself a back door into it   to access the irrelevant list   just a social security number   if anyone ever found out  i'd lose access so     nine digits  that's all we get   and we have no idea why it picked diane hansen   it wouldn't be steering us toward her  if it wasn't seeing something   but i don't know if i can protect hansen   i can't see the whole picture   i offered you a job  mr  reese   i never said it would be easy     hey  carter    yeah   you hear about your pal anton   no   him and his father tried to buy some guns   wound up getting shot with their own merchandise   are they dead   nope  embarrassed enough   they got taken out by one guy  in a suit   reese  i have bad news   lawrence pope was stabbed to death last night in his cell   what   they're trying to cover their tracks   hansen must be next   you wanted to meet   remsen and avenue d in canarsie  20 minutes   finch   it's happening now            hello   are you here   hello   hello   are you gonna keep me waiting  stills   we don't have time for this   what's your problem   pope is dead   the problem is wheeler   you idiot  he knows   he knows about pope and   and maybe even some of the others   i can take care of the files at the office   but you have to take care of wheeler   tonight   hey  look what i found   we got ourselves a groupie   heavily armed  too   you know this guy   no   you're not law enforcement   cartel finally grow some stones   send somebody to take care of us   who the hell are you   concerned    third party   take care of him   and  uh  get rid of wheeler tonight   make it look clean   hey  stills   you screw this up  i won't let it get to me   i'll take care of you just like i took care of pope   i can look after myself   you know that   nice spot   it's oyster bay   glad you like it   you're gonna be here a long  long time   i'm curious   was there a point where you knew you'd become a bad guy   woke up one morning  realized i was paid  to guard a bunch of jerks from wall street  who were robbing everybody blind   they're stealing more than my annual salary in a afternoon   so i said   what the hell    i don't believe you   see  i've been watching you  lionel   your heart's not really into it   now  stills  he does it for money   but i think you do it because you're loyal   what's the difference   it's why i'm gonna let you live   yeah  i'm considering sticking around new york for a while   if i do  i'm gonna need someone on the inside   and you might come in handy   ah  so i'm working for you now  huh   that's right   but i've got two rules   one  you so much as hurt anybody   and i'll kill you   i don't particularly like killing people   but i'm very good at it   and two     you have to be more careful   for instance  if you're gonna put someone  in the backseat of your car   you have to search them properly            no  please   what are you doing   you have your vest on  officer   yeah   where the hell have you    there's no time  we were wrong   hansen isn't the target   she's the ringleader   they're going after wheeler  tonight            yo   wheeler's up there   he heads to the gym most nights   i got doyle upstairs staking him out   the place is a dump   there's no doorman  no cameras  nobody   we'll take him in the lobby   soon as it's done  we take the shooter out   give him a block and then take him out   head shots this time  you understand   yeah  yeah  yeah   get our friend out of the trunk   who is this guy   some ex con wheeler put away   azarello  lights   doyle  talk to me   he's coming out now   come on  henry  let's go   wait   show me that basketball of yours  let's go  come on   damn  he's got his kid with him   what a waste   henry  watch out   you're about to kill a man     and his son   please   please don't do this   drop your weapon            that isn't true actually   if you keep working on it   if you keep throwing the ball like that   you'll be able to throw that fast     really    absolutely   let him go   i can't do that   i let him go  my friends and i go to jail   drag your friend outside  and take him to the hospital   right now   i think i kill you and your friend here   make it look like you killed each other   then  just because you pissed me off     i'm gonna kill your family   and all your friends   i don't have any friends   i don't have any family left either   went around the world looking for bad guys   but there were plenty of you right here all along   so now  essentially   you're telling us you couldn't see what was happening  in the parking lot at all   i'm done  your honor   ms  hansen   the state isn't paying you by the hour  counselor   why don't we have the defendant tell you  in her own words   let's listen to the 911 call she made   and hey   take care of wheeler  tonight   make it look clean  and stills   you screw this up  i won't let it get to me   i'll take care of you just like i took care of pope   i can look after myself   you know that            you ready to get to work  officer   i'm no good to you   i'm dead   just a matter of time before the gangs get me   or i a   no one knows you're involved   i took care of that   besides  they'll be too busy looking for stills   the police will think he's run for it   the gangs and the mob will think he's gone witness protection   is that where he is  witness protection   no  lionel   he's in the trunk   only problem is  uh    um     i had to shoot him with your gun   and you'd have a hard time explaining that one  so     you'll be taking another trip   and i'm not coming along this time   where am i going   oyster bay   where no one's gonna find him for a long  long time   i'll be in touch   you have a decision to make   the machine gave you another number   the numbers never stop coming   you should know that up front   why me   i've been watching you for a long time  john   we have more in common than you might think   the world thinks we're both dead  for starters   you programmed the machine to delete those irrelevant numbers   now you're trying to save them   what changed your mind   let's just say you're not the only one  that's lost someone   if you wanna leave   i'll give you enough money to get as far as you need   disappear   and if i stay   sooner or later both of us'll probably wind up dead   actually dead this time   i said i'd tell you the truth   didn't say you'd like it   start talking  officer   you think i'm gonna rat on my friends   please   you can tell the d a  all about your crooked pals   i wanna know about him  the guy who came after you   i don't know anything   it was just some guy alone in a suit   yeah  well  you're gonna tell me  everything that you don't know about him  and where i can find him            sync and corrections by n17t01
