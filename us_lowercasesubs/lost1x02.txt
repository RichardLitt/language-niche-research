any survivors   no   it's dual band  military spec   chances are  the battery's good   but the radio is dead   can you fix it   i need some time   doctor  the man with the shrapnel     i i think you should take a look at him   chain smoking jackass   some people have problems   yeah  the people who have problems is us     him   you're okay   i like you   you're okay  too   hurley   sayid   how do you know how to do all that   i was a military communications officer   oh  yeah   you ever see battle   i fought in the gulf war   no way  i got a buddy who fought over there   he was in the 104th airborne   what were you    air force  army   the republican guard   is it working   it seems to be     except we're not picking up a signal   why do we need to pick up a signal   aren't we trying to send one   yes  but what you want to see here is little bars   the bars would show the radio is getting reception   we need the bars   we could broadcast blind   hope that someone    maybe a ship somewhere    picks up our distress call   but that could be a waste of the battery  which might not last that long   there is one thing we could try   what   seeing if we can get a signal from high ground   how high   how is he   can you do anything   pull out the shrapnel   but you said yesterday that if you took it out     i know  but that was yesterday   i was hoping he'd be at a hospital by now   if i leave him like this  he'll be dead within a day   if i open him up    if i can control the bleeding  and if he doesn't go into sepsis  and if i can find some antibiotics     he might be all right   i'm going on a hike   sorry   sayid fixed the transceiver  but we can't use it   not from here   kate  wait a minute   you're the one who said that we had to send out a signal   look  you saw what that thing did to that pilot   yeah  i did   what makes you think we're any safer here than we are in the jungle   wait for me  i don't know how long this will take   sayid said the battery won't last   all right   if you see or hear anything     anything     run   what's up   what    that   what    eat that   dude  dude   i'm starving     but i'm nowhere near that hungry   no  no  no thank

game than checkers   you play checkers with your pop   no   i live in australia with my mom   you have no accent   yeah  i know  we move a lot   she got sick   she died a couple of weeks ago     you're having a bad month    i guess   backgammon is the oldest game in the world   archaeologists found sets  when they excavated the ruins of ancient mesopotamia    that's older than jesus christ   did they have dice and stuff   mm  but theirs weren't made of plastic   their dice were made of bones   cool   two players  two sides   one is light  one is dark   walt     do you want to know a secret   no  thank you   no  it's okay   okay  thanks   oh  god   i just felt it  i just     come here  feel this  here  feel this  feel this   do you feel that   there  that's a kick   there  right there's a foot   wait  wait  he's moving around   he  he   i guess i think you're a he   okay  wide open space   you should check the radio  see if we're good   we're not gonna have any reception here   just try it   i don't want to waste the batteries   i'm not asking you to keep it on all day   we're still blocked by the mountain   just check the damn radio   if i just check    we might not have any juice left when we get to     oh  god   what the hell's that   something's coming   it's coming towards us  i think   come on  let's move   i shouldn't have come     sawyer    let him go   that's     that's a big bear   you think that's what killed the pilot   no   no  that's a tiny  teeny version compared to that   guys  this isn't just a bear   it's a polar bear   you're sure he's out   he's out   how do you know he won't wake up when you yank that thing out   i don't   hey  guy  are you awake   yo  there's a rescue plane  we're saved  yay   yeah  he's out     so  what do you want me      it's unlikely that he'll regain consciousness   but the pain might bring him around  and if it does  i need you to hold him down   i'm not so good around blood  man   then don't look   yeah  but

prisoner   i'm the what   you found a gun on a u s  marshal   yes  i think you did   you knew where it was  because you were the one he was bringing back to the states   those handcuffs were on you
