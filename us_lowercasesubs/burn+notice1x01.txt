cayman islands  with someone shooting at you   mira para la piscina  vamos hasta las palmas   est bien  gracias   mr  westen             i spoke to lucy   she told me you do investigations   i do a lot of things   last month there was a robbery    22 million in odd jewelry and antiques   it was very bad   looks like the police are into it   says here they're talking to persons of interest   you're a person of interest   the police asked me questions   when this happened  i was at home watching tv with my kid   the security code they used for the alarm is the master code    my code       besides supervise the staff  i set the shifts    it looks bad   yeah  that looks pretty bad   i told the police  i worked there 15 years   i would never do this   mr  pyne talked to them  said it wasn't me   they took my passport  told me not to travel   if they arrest me  my son  he's 8 years old    i'm all he has        i'm desperate  please don't make my son an orphan      just so we're clear     you want me to figure out  who ran off with  22 million in stuff   catch the bad guys  clear your name   all for    what is it   4 500     4 600   oh  well that's much better   i'm sorry   i have nowhere else to turn  please   all right  i'm gonna see what i can do   i need to talk to your boss    can i do that       yeah  come on   what are you  exactly  mr  westen   a private detective   oh  no  i wish  nothing that official   no  i'm just a friend of a friend in town for a while      i thought i'd see if i can help   oh  thank you   javier's been with me for a number of years             it kills me to see what he's going through    what was stolen   some jewelry some artwork   insured  but the artwork was irreplaceable   impressionists  mostly   i had a sisley   a clausen  and some other works   houses  landscapes   i'm in real estate  so i've got this thing for houses   and you're confident javier had nothing to do with it   oh  this is miami   any incident  and the police blame the nearest cuban   or haitian   you should have seen the way they were all over my gardeners   what about the security codes   oh  lord knows  the police are looking into it   you know  to be honest  i'm just glad nobody was hurt   was there anyone unknown to you around    guests   any new business associates that came to the house   not that i can think of  i went over all this with the police   you can talk to vince if you want to   he takes care of my security   i just have a few questions  see if anyone missed anything              i talked to the police       i don't mean to bother you  it would be a big help   does mr  pyne have any enemies   anybody worth  100 mil has enemies   which is why he hired a bodyguard   i mean  a head of security   i'm specifically talking about enemies that might rob his home  though   we know who did this   mr  pyne has a soft spot for javier   i don't   as far as i'm concerned  the sooner he's arrested the better   well  you've been a big help   place is upstairs in the back   rent is  200 a month  and     if anyone finds out i'm there  i say i broke in    sam told me             it's not so easy to live in this place  you know   all night  club is boom boom   fine  it's fine   but i think guy next door sells drugs to my customers   make fight with people   try to talk  he puts a gun in my face   now  at home  i can deal     but here  with immigration  liquor license   it's a big risk for me  yeah    i can handle that   good   the real michael westen yes   yeah   back home  your story russian intelligence tells to scare   they say you are one name for many people   special operations team   they think one person cannot make so much problems   nope   just me       nice to meet you  michael   new world  yes   yes    hello   michael   mom   my mom would have been a great nsa communications operative   how did you get this number   that's how you greet your mother   i got it from your girlfriend    fiona   mom  what do you want   were you gonna come and see me   i'm not gonna be in town that long  so i can't   come now  then  you can drive me to the doctor   i don't even have a car  so i     yeah  well  you'll figure something out   drop me in the middle of the gobi desert   bury me in a goddamn cave on the moon   and somehow   she'd find a way to call me and ask me for a favor   i don't like stealing cars  but sometimes it's necessary   i have rules  though    i'll keep it clean   if i take your car on a work day  i'll have it back by 5 00             things have gone to hell since you left    thank god you're back   i'm not back   you're here for the holidays though   i mean you're staying for christmas     mom  don't smoke in the car  please  it's not mine please   figuring out if a car is tailing you  is mostly about driving like you're an idiot   you speed up  slow down  signal one way  turn the other   of course  ideally   you're doing this without your mother in the car   michael  where are you going  the hospital is on 20th   this is a shortcut  mom  please do not smoke in the car   do not smoke in the car   you know  you missed your father's funeral   by eight years   well  last time i talked to him   he said   i'll see you in hell  boy    so i figured we had something on the books   michael   the two of you were so much alike   i don't know why you had to antagonize him   mom  we were nothing  alike   everything i did antagonized him   being alive antagonized him   everything i did was a reason for him to slap me around   michael  what are you doing   who's driving    you or me   actually  losing a tail isn't about driving fast   a high speed pursuit is just gonna land you on the 6 00 news   so you just keep driving like an idiot  until the other guy makes a mistake   again  all of this is easier  without a passenger yelling at you  for missing a decade's worth of thanksgivings   you were the one that kept the family going   after you left  everything just fell apart   i've been sending money  what about nate   don't get me started  your brother is a mess   you really should go see him michael   i don't think it's a good idea for us to see each other   well  i can't take care of him all by myself   i am sick  you know that i'm sick   well  what i know is that you've been treated  for every disease known to man   i know this because i'm paying all the bills   just because they can't find out what's wrong with me   does not mean i'm not sick     please    you don't know  michael       i don't tell you everything that goes on   i don't need to know everything      what     stop    mike     just     look  we're here   are you coming in   no  i have to make a phone call  mom     i'm right behind you   fine  michael   okay  mom    hello   yeah   michael westen for dan siebels    i'm sorry     yeah  i know  i know   he doesn't exist   you tell him from me  if he doesn't call me back  i will be in touch with him soon   sorry  i'm  uh    i just    i'm not     sleep through an aerial bombing or two  and noise isn't an issue   you just need some privacy and a bed   in a pinch  you can lose the bed   but the privacy is important for projects like this one   with everyone x raying and chemical testing their mail these days   a box of wire and pipe  and batteries sprinkled with chemical fertilizer  is a great attention getter   hey  thanks for coming  come on in      you want some coffee   no  no   it's not a problem  i made some just fresh    i just wanted to talk about         this is my son  david  david  say hi   hi    are you a soldier   uh     no  sort of   my dad says you're here to help us   yeah  i might be   i just need to talk to your dad about some money first   then are you gonna shoot the people that robbed mr  pyne   no  no  that shouldn't be necessary   what if they shoot at you   well  in that case  it would be necessary  so yeah   okay  david  go play    i can play here   in your room   want to see my room   david  go   i'm sorry   it's fine   so  will you help   i'll need half the money up front   i don't know   2 300   okay  wait  wait   i need you to know something   i'll follow this wherever it leads   i finish what i start  we do it my way    no questions   got it   thank you   working hard   tanning is an art and a science  mike   hey  you want something to drink   they got guys here that will bring you whatever you want   no  i'm fine   so  what have you found out about pyne's hired gun   well  he washed out of the rangers after a couple years   then he went to work for some private military outfit in iraq   some kind of meathead mercenary sort of thing   any progress with the job   i checked the estate's security logs   nothing there    so it's the hard way  then   the best angle is the art   i find the buyer   i'll work my way back to who pulled off the job   well  how you gonna do that   i need you to set up a meeting with me and barry   can do   whether you're a coke dealer  a thief  an arms dealer   or a spy  you need someone to clean your money   which makes a good money launderer  the closest thing you can get to a yellow pages for criminals             even better   a money launderer will always take your phone call   burn notice or no burn notice   good to see you  i've heard about your troubles     yeah  well  i'm working on it  thanks for coming  barry   i'm in the service industry  that's what i do    i help   so    what you need   an art dealer   no  no  no  no   art's a bad place to park money these days   i r s  is all over the place   plus  some schmuck in new york says the wrong thing   take a bath   how about stamps  nice and portable     coins  got this guy who does coins   all cash   has to be art     i need someone to find me a piece that's not on the regular market   hot paintings   i might know someone   nobody gets hurt   nobody you care about   just remember who still helped you when you were down   me  barry    that's who  i gave you love   you remember   i'll remember   oye  mart n     excuse me  i'm just     sorry  man  we were waiting on sugar and got carried away    sugar   yeah   i don't know his real name   but he usually hooks us up    we wanted to score some  e     are you the new guy   leave   now   mom  what is it   this isn't your mom   dan  hey  good to hear from you  i thought you lost my number   just spent three hours with the fbi   discussing your little present   they wondered why someone was sending me  a pipe bomb with no explosive in it             thought it'd get your attention  so tell me what's going on   i don't know  burn notice is eyes only   for what it's worth  i think it's bull   but i don't control these things   tell me who to talk to  or i'm coming to d c  and raising some hell   don't do that  michael   you're on all the fbi watch lists   you go anywhere  they're all over you   what for   all i know is that whoever did this wants you on ice   you leave miami  you heat up fast   we're talking manhunt  police in every state   things may change  but for now  be smart   lay low   can i at least see the burn notice   if i could see who issued it   then maybe i can do something about this   i risked enough just calling   look  some of us are still on your side   you pull another stunt like this  though   and i won't be one of them   what's up  bro  you new around here   yeah             well  my name is sugar   and i heard you messed with some of my friends last night   i asked a few of your customers to get out of here  yeah   what's your problem   my problem right now  is a pretty boy drug dealer with a bad dye job  that's standing in my way    ohh   whoa did i hurt you  bro   doesn't matter how much training you have     a broken rib is a broken rib   don't start fights you can't finish  bro   aah   i'll break it   i don't want to  but i will if i have to   all right  all right   all right  let go  let go  let go   you come highly recommended  mr  westen   what are you interested in                  specifically   british post impressionists   sisley  steer  that's nice   we don't see much of that   most specialty stock is out of the east these days   iraqi antiquities  russian icons   although that's mostly forged garbage   i can get you some french impressionists   my collection is mostly focused on the camden town group   oh  very nice   i wish i had something   several pieces were on the market about six months ago   there was a sisley and several clausens   although  it didn't sell   really  do you remember who   oh  i don't remember the name   one of these condo developers that are everywhere these days   but  during the impressionist bubble in the '90s   he went to all the major dealers   wanted to dump it   it was all very discreet  but      people talk   really what happened   nobody was interested is what happened   not at his price   i'm sorry i can't help  but     no  no  no  you    you have been very helpful  thank you   i do have some greco roman nude wrestling statues  you might like to take a look at   i never run around in the bushes in a ski mask  when i'm breaking in someplace   somebody catches you  what are you gonna say   you want to look like a legitimate visitor  until the very last minute   if you can't look legit  confused works almost as well   maybe get a soda from the fridge or a yogurt   if you're caught  you just act confused  and apologize like crazy for taking the yogurt   nothing could be more innocent   cracking an old school safe is pretty tough   but modern high tech security makes it much easier   thing is  nobody wipes off a fingerprint scanner  after they use it   so what's left on the scanner  is a fingerprint   fighting for the little guy is for suckers   we all do it once in a while   but the trick is to get in and out quickly  without getting involved   that's one trick i never really mastered   javier  javier    you want some cereal   no   all i got is the one with the little marshmallow guys        don't worry about that   i just want to talk to you before you go to work   what is it  is it something wrong     basically  your boss sold you out   he robbed his own house  probably had vince do the job   he collects the insurance  and you're the fall guy   mr  pyne  no  he wouldn't     he talked to the police for me     that just makes it easier for him to collect on the insurance   you're a trusted employee  he had no idea   take a look at this   half his real estate projects are just paper     empty lots he paid a loan officer to sign off on   he borrowed against those to finance other deals   but with the market cooling  he's bleeding money   and the art is all he has   without the insurance payout  it all comes crashing down   what do i do   well  you could go to jail     you could run   statute of limitations is about 20 years    or you could fight back       pyne doesn't want any of this to get out   as long as we have this information  we have leverage          i'll handle the details   but it could get dangerous   people do bad things when this much money is on the line    money     don't worry about the money   you want to do this or not   you're not going to work today or ever again   i'm gonna go talk to pyne   but be prepared    this could get sketchy   hey   you really want me to shoot someone  don't you   hey   so  mr  westen  what can i do for you   i just wanted to update you   fortunately  i think we can be pretty sure  that javier had nothing to do with the robbery   have you spoken to the police   i'm not sure you want me to do that   take a look at this   i think this points pretty clearly  to  um  some other suspects   where'd you get this   i found it in the course of my investigation   cops might find it  too  if  say  javier was arrested   i'm guessing that's something you'd want to avoid   well  you two have a lot to talk about   i know my way out   does that shirt come in men's   you're head of my security   well  it's your job  damn it   powerful people don't like being pushed around   you can never quite predict  what they're going to do     or have their washed out special forces security guys do   the point is  blackmail is a little like owning a pit bull   it might protect you  or it might bite your hand off   that's why it pays to make sure you know what they're thinking   and that means eavesdropping   hi  can i help you   yeah  i need two of these     and your cheapest phone    that one   oh  the  hello  sweetheart     is it for your little girl   no   oh  the  hello  sweetheart   yeah  that's fine   to build a listening device   you need a crappy phone with a mike that picks up everything   but you want the battery power

thoughts as to why you're so unpopular   why didn't they just kill you   it might be a lesson  a warning   maybe somebody wants to offer me a job   but they want me desperate before they make the offer   it could be a lot of things  i don't know   it'll be good for you to stay in one place resolve some issues   well  i travel halfway across the world to get away from those   my point exactly   maybe if you stop running   you can maintain a normal relationship   listen  fi   there's a few things i'm good at     tactical analysis  hand to hand combat  and i'm a decent cook   but relationships    they're just not my thing   they never were   well  now you're in miami   get yourself a 24 year old with big  fake tits   they bore me   if it makes you feel any better     you were the closest

never get homesick   i think i've got a parasite   you don't have a parasite   pills don't work      as soon as it reaches your liver     the pills are for you  not to think you're sick all the time
