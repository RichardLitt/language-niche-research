him like you do   i'm not an agent anymore   he cut out his victims' eyes as a nod  to his favorite works of poe   he didn't just eviscerate 14 female students   he was making art   sarah was his unfinished work   he wanted to get the ending right   the point of sarah's death was for you   he's finding people   they're his followers   prison guard  gay neighbors    how do they figure into your

room  i know   i've studied this house a lot    what is that   i threw this up here earlier   it's my kit   it's important to have the right tools   i've been planning this for a long time   sync and corrections by n17t01  convicted serial killer joe carroll  has been captured and is being held  at the richmond federal detention center   as of early this morning  carroll's son joey matthews  and his nanny denise harris have been missing   an amber alert is in effect   and we ask that anyone with any information  as to their whereabouts please contact the fbi   what's going on  ryan  where is my son   we need to talk   why is joe doing this   i don't understand how denise is involved   are they gonna hurt joey   i think she's your nanny because of joe   i think he put her here    no  that's impossible   she's been joey's nanny for two years   she lives with me  i know her   the accomplices  the guys that helped him kill sarah fuller   they were there for years   using false identities   we think that she did  too   i did a background check   i checked her references  i have records   can i see them   yeah   heavy traces of zolpidem on the kitchen counter   she drugged the guards   i bet the kid  too   carried him down the back staircase to the garage   car was found 10 minutes ago  in a parking lot 45 minutes from here   denise harris from alexandria   her address  her references  it's all there   she talked about her mom a lot   i guess they were close   no dad in the picture   you ever meet any of her friends  or overhear a phone conversation   her friends never came over  she was shy   she kept to herself   she read in her room a lot   i can't be this blind  can i   you cannot afford to think like that  do you understand   find my son   hey  you can't run from me   ha ha ha  whee   err   i got you   look at this place   wow   whose house is this   friend of a friend   and it's ok that we're here   yeah  come on  let's check it out   can i call my mom now   honey  i told you   your mom told us not to call   she doesn't want anyone to know where we are   you remember what i said   we're on an adventure   mm hmm  come here   what's wrong with you     i hate kids    stop it   i do  i hate talking to them   i hate looking at them   hey  not this kid  ok   you like this kid   just keep saying it over and over again until it sticks   i'd rather snap his neck   i'm kidding   is there a problem   nope  no  not here   we're on an adventure with a kid   and i like kids  especially this kid   what was that about   it's been a long night  he's tired   it's good to have you back   _  more developments from richmond  virginia   upon sarah fuller's death as the search  for young joey matthews continues   convicted serial killer joe carroll's son  is believed to have been abducted     ok  the team over there's covering the ground search   that group is on our prison guard jordy   and we've got joey's search right here   ryan hardy  this is agent mitchell  cyberforensics   she's from our dc office  she's awesome   nice to meet you  sir   where are we are on the nanny   i know denise harris is not from alexandria  because denise harris does not exist   but we ided sarah fuller's gay or not so gay neighbors   real names are jacob wells and paul torres   jacob is from lake whitehurst   paul is form el paso  texas   where he's a computer consultant with a history of fraud   which explains all the fake ids   where's agent mason   i'd just get rid of him  send him home   you can't  you heard carroll  he's part of the story   then sideline him before he cracks  because he will crack   you weren't around  well  this is awkward   hello  mr  hardy   i'm agent debra parker   i'm new the party   we were just  uh  discussing you   agent parker's in from quantico  she's taking the lead   i want to speak to mr  hardy privately   where's mason   she's on her way back to quantico   apparently she put a former agent alone  in a room with joe carroll  and let him break 3 of his fingers   turns out that's a no no    marshal turner thinks i should dismiss you   but he's remembering you for the man you were 10 years ago   not the man you are now   and there's a difference   i hope so because joe carroll  has cast you as the main character in his psycho sequel   so i can't just kick you to the curb   i'm sorry about sarah fuller   i want a gun   i'm not asking to be an agent again   but you need to deputize me and give me a gun   when was the last time you had a drink   director franklin asked me to be here   and if i'm gonna stay  i want a gun   i'll take it under advisement   how's your heart  i see here you suffer  from  uh  cardiomyopathy   is this really the best use of our time   there's a child missing   so tell me about carroll's accomplices   he used this prison guard to gain access to the internet  to create a following  like a cult   let's not use that word  people don't hear it well   well  you can call it what you want   but he solicited people to do his bidding   carroll mentioned a letter   claire matthews received a letter about a week before carroll's escape   it was personal   he questioned my relationship with her   as did the fbi 8 years ago   so now you're up to speed   we got more bodies   blood smear  jordy was messy   left prints everywhere   made no attempt to conceal his identity   victim number 3   she tried to run  quick struggle   not the case for the others   there were 9 girls in the house at the time   some of them woke up when they heard the screams   and jordy ran   he removed the eyes   carroll's signature   is jordy playing at poe's greatest hits   it's paying homage to carroll   it's following in the footsteps of his hero   it's ceremonial  the work of an acolyte   let's not use that word either   it implies the other word   let's say   carroll's accomplices    pick a word  any word  but this is mind control at work   why have his son kidnapped   it's an offering  it's biblical   they think of him as the son of god   something to be worshiped   or sacrificed   carroll knows where the kid is   he's not gonna tell us   but he might tell his wife   carroll asked to see her   he's smarter than that  he's not gonna tell her anything   well  let's find out   what do i say   is there anything special i need to ask him   try to engage him about joey   speak to his paternal instincts   make joey important to him   are you sure you want to do this   i like your new place   me  too   how was court today   moving fast  won't be long now   i can't go anymore  i can't look at him   i don't ever want to see him again   you don't have to   my hands are shaking   my god  you still have that effect on me   you're so beautiful always    where's my son   our son  claire   please  joe  where is he   do you remember when we went to antigua   we rented that little cottage on the beach   we were only supposed to be there for a few days   but it turned into a whole month   i don't think we wore clothes the entire time   he's growing up so fast   joey is   he's so brilliant  reading well beyond his years    melville and twain   he finished  robinson crusoe  last week   but he didn't like it very much   it must be so hard for you   you must feel so betrayed   again   come on  claire  hang in there   so you    got my letter   is he in danger  joe   please just let him be  ok  ok   please don't let him be hurt   i'd like some answers to my questions   tell me where joey is first   i asked you some very specific questions   i'd

is that   supercool   can i call mom now   honey  she asked us not to call   we have to wait   why is my dad such a bad man   oh  honey   come here   maybe he's not so bad   maybe we just don't understand him   i'll tell you what  why don't you get settled  and check out all your new things    good and bad no longer existed   it was all degrees of evil now   gwendolyn held his dying body  as the storm raged on   death had finally arrived   and it was glorious to the touch      thank you    thanks   thank you for coming  uh     emma  i loved your book   so you're the one  emma   it's beautiful  all the imagery's so vivid   i felt like i was there   oh  you just made my day   uh  may i just  uh    you have such lovely eyes  emma   don't deprive us of them   did she die   gwendolyn   at the end  when she went into the sea and started swimming to the horizon   well  you tell me   i think she died   she was swimming toward the horizon  toward the sun   in death  she found hope   emma  hon  you almost done     i'm ready  mom     oh   so this is the fella you came to see   my  my  i thought all writers were big nosed and mushy     not you    mom  please  let's go   i'm giving the man a compliment   no  sir  you do not look like a writer   did he sign your book   oh  yes  mustn't forget this    emma  hopefully yours  joe    so which is our room   you mean  your room   jacob and i are taking the master   you can't do that   well  you're not gay anymore  remember   we were never gay   it's just with the kid  is that cool   don't worry about it   i tracked her through the prison footage   she used several aliases very similar to the gay guys    the guy beside her   jacob wells  you connected them   and get this  i did a search for jacob     paul torres   they signed in together   you were right  they're all in on this   hey  find the first time the nanny visited carroll   maybe she didn't use an alias    ok  there's an emma hill in petersburg  virginia   i have an address   petersburg is too close  they'd never risk it   unless they're hiding under our nose   go  take weston   and ryan   call ahead  have the local authorities meet you there   ok   nobody's home   this is definitely the place   neighbors say they haven't seen anybody in a long time   ok  you can't do that   nope  you can't do that   i'm gonna go check around back   see if i can see through the window   you shouldn't be here   you know  you're gonna die   only not today   unh   good news   no dead puppies   bad news   i think it's time to use that word  nobody wants to use   so we have a cult   you sure this man wasn't jordy   height  weight   nothing matched  it was someone else   we weren't supposed to find this place   this is where they met and planned   i think carroll was    carroll's using poe's work as a religion   he's speaking to people through gothic romanticism   there's a pathology to today's internet techno bred minds   it's created a new    vacancy in our humanity   find the ones with additional disorders   jackpot   enter a handsome  charismatic man  who can touch them   let them feel their lives for the first time   conditions them   the only way to truly live is to kill   or some crap like that   i run the bureau's alternative religion unit   did i not mention that   cults   my specialty   hey  we online     yeah    is it secure   it's a little slow  but i got us keyed into the board   it's untraceable   you check the news yet   yeah  we're everywhere  man   that's the photo that they pick of me   i hate that picture   did you get it running  what's up with jordy   well  he hasn't e mailed yet   but they did find 3 girls at the sorority house   score for the village idiot   hey  paul  will you go watch joey for a few minutes   i can do it   be a good wingman  paul   are you sure he's straight   because he is acting like a jealous little bitch   he just feels like the third wheel   and for a long time  it was just me and him   now everything's changed   well  he needs to adjust   this is what joe wanted   what do you think   my mom says that it makes me look like a boy  or a girl who doesn't like boys   well  your mother doesn't understand you   she never has   no  i like it very much  emma   it's beautiful   what if i told you that i might know  someone else who might like it  too   a guy   you want to set me up   i think you'd like each other   i don't know   i love our visits   they mean the world to me   but i think you need to make more friends   you know  go out  have some fun  huh   heh heh heh   emma   hi   joe said you'd be my type   what's your type   special   i've got 8  maybe 9 different handwritings   i want analysis on each one   how many prints   several partial   our masked man was living here  too   unmade bed  fresh food   there's internet upstairs   he took his laptop and server   _  is it ok if i'm happy about this   i mean  i know   i know divorce is not a happy subject   but i'm happy   well  it's a new chapter in your life   i mean  you know  joe's been sentenced  he's gone   i think you deserve some happy   all right  well  here's to being a single lady again   ooh  that's depressing   ha ha   kiss me   yeah  yeah  you heard me   i'm single  so just     are you sure you want me to kiss you   uh  yeah  i'm very sure   i've been sure for a long time   well  if you're sure   unless   are   but    are you sure  because if    i don't think first kisses are  supposed to have this much discussion   i know  it takes the spontaneity out of it   yeah  it kind of does   did i just ruin our first kiss   i think it can be salvaged   so we got an update from rick   fbi found emma's house   what do you mean they found emma's house   was jordy there   no  rick was  but he got away   now he wants emma to call   why   because she's in charge  remember   i'm not trusted with the important things   that's not true  all right   she's just been here for longer  that's all   you

victory by the leading man  that cements the love story   what if i hadn't arrived in time   well  that's what makes the story so unpredictable   you got to toughen up  ryan   you're dealing with depraved minds   sick and twisted   jordy was a mere puppy  compared to some of the games i have in store for you   why you doing this  joe   the challenge  ryan   accept it   we've barely even started   i have so many surprises  waiting for you   and how long do you think you can keep this up behind bars   what's the end game   that's a question the hero must answer   i'm sorry  ryan  you really are gonna have to do  some of the work yourself   jordy was the first step in your return to form   you saved the day  how does it feel  to be victorious  to kill the villain   i didn't kill him   yeah  jordy's alive and well   he's in a cell right down the hall   that wasn't part of the plan  was it   no  it doesn't matter   he knows nothing   man's a halfwit   extremely short shelf life  you know   probably shouldn't tell him that when i speak to him   sleep tight   it's good  ok  thanks   you don't have to stay here  you know   we could take you someplace else   where   you should
